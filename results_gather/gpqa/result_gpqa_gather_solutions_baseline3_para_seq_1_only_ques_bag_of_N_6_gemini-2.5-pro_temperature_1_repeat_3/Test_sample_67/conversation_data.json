Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle, meaning its spin angular momentum `S` has a z-component `Sz` with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down).\n*   Its magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component of the magnetic moment is `μz = γSz`.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_initial = B * ẑ` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian (energy operator) of the particle in this field is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S ⋅ B_initial) = -γB * Sz`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n    *   The energy for spin up (`|+z>`) is `E_up = -γB * (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`.\n    *   The energy for spin down (`|-z>`) is `E_down = -γB * (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`.\n*   The lowest energy state is the spin-up state, `|+z>`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The Change in the System\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field along the Z-axis is turned off, and a new magnetic field `B_final = B * ŷ` (pointing in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n*   For all `t > 0`, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian: `H' = -μ ⋅ B_final = -γ(S ⋅ B_final) = -γB * Sy`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the System\n\nThe problem asks for the oscillation of the *average* (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μz(t)>`. This can be found in two ways.\n\n#### Method 1: Larmor Precession (Classical Analogy)\n\nThis is the most direct method. The time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector, `<S>`, in a magnetic field `B` is governed by the equation:\n`d<S>/dt = γ * <S> x B`\n\nThis equation describes the precession of the vector `<S>` around the magnetic field vector `B` with an angular frequency known as the **Larmor frequency**, `ω_L`.\n\n*   **Larmor Frequency:** `ω_L = γ * |B|`\n*   In our case, the new field has magnitude `B`, so the precession frequency is `ω_L = γB`.\n*   **Initial Spin Vector:** At `t=0`, the state is `|+z>`. The expectation value of the spin vector is `<S(0)> = <+z|S|+z>`.\n    *   `<Sx(0)> = <+z|Sx|+z> = 0`\n    *   `<Sy(0)> = <+z|Sy|+z> = 0`\n    *   `<Sz(0)> = <+z|Sz|+z> = ħ/2`\n    *   So, initially, `<S(0)> = (ħ/2) * ẑ`. The spin vector points along the Z-axis.\n*   **Precession:** For `t>0`, the spin vector `<S(t)>` precesses around the new magnetic field `B_final = B * ŷ`. This means `<S(t)>` rotates in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis.\n*   **Z-Component Oscillation:** As the vector `<S(t)>` rotates in the X-Z plane, its projection onto the Z-axis, `<Sz(t)>`, will oscillate. The frequency of this rotation is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n*   Therefore, `<Sz(t)>` oscillates as `<Sz(t)> = <Sz(0)> * cos(ω_L * t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γB * t)`.\n*   The z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μz(t)> = γ * <Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γB * t)`.\n*   The angular frequency of this oscillation is `γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation\n\n1.  **Express Initial State in New Basis:** The new Hamiltonian `H'` is proportional to `Sy`. We need to express the initial state `|+z>` in the eigenbasis of `Sy`. The eigenstates of `Sy` are:\n    *   `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n    *   `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n    Inverting these gives:\n    *   `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    So, `|ψ(t=0)> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n\n2.  **Apply Time Evolution:** The state at a later time `t` is `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iH't/ħ)|ψ(0)>`. Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are eigenstates of `H'`, this is straightforward.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues for `H' = -γB*Sy` are `E'_+ = -γB(ħ/2)` for `|+y>` and `E'_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)` for `|-y>`.\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(-iE'_+t/ħ)|+y> + e^(-iE'_-t/ħ)|-y> ]`\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(iγBt/2)|+y> + e^(-iγBt/2)|-y> ]`\n\n3.  **Calculate Expectation Value `<Sz(t)>`:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `|+y>` and `|-y>` back into `|ψ(t)>`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>` (After simplification, as shown in the thought process).\n    *   Now calculate `<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`:\n        `<Sz(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * Sz * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n    *   Using `Sz|±z> = ±(ħ/2)|±z>` and the orthogonality of the states:\n        `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n    *   Using the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n        `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n4.  **Find Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the spin is `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The term oscillates with the form `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω` is `γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods show that the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n*   The particle is spin-1/2 and has a magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where **S** is the spin angular momentum operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field **B₀** = B **ẑ** (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state. The interaction Hamiltonian is H₀ = -**μ** ⋅ **B₀** = -γS_z B.\n*   The eigenvalues of S_z are +ħ/2 (spin-up) and -ħ/2 (spin-down). The corresponding energy levels are E = -γ(±ħ/2)B. Assuming γ > 0, the lower energy state corresponds to S_z = +ħ/2.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is the spin-up eigenstate along the z-axis, denoted as |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z. In the standard S_z basis, this state is represented by the vector [1, 0]ᵀ.\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian (t ≥ 0)\n*   At t=0, the Z-field is turned off, and a new field **B'** = B **ŷ** (pointing in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n*   The new Hamiltonian governing the system's evolution for t ≥ 0 is H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γ**S** ⋅ (B **ŷ**) = -γB S_y.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n*   The state of the particle at a later time t is given by the Schrödinger equation: |ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩, where U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ) is the time evolution operator.\n*   Substituting H', we get:\n    U(t) = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t / ħ) = exp(i(γBt)S_y / ħ)\n*   Let's define the Larmor frequency, ω = γB. The evolution operator becomes:\n    U(t) = exp(iωt S_y / ħ)\n*   For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operators are related to the Pauli matrices (σ) by **S** = (ħ/2)**σ**. So, S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y.\n    U(t) = exp(iωt (ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y)\n*   We can use the identity for the exponential of a Pauli matrix: exp(iaσ_k) = cos(a)I + i sin(a)σ_k.\n    Here, a = ωt/2 and k = y.\n    U(t) = cos(ωt/2)I + i sin(ωt/2)σ_y\n*   In the S_z basis, σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] and I = [[1, 0], [0, 1]].\n    U(t) = cos(ωt/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(ωt/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n    U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + [[0, sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), 0]]\n    U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]\n*   Now, we apply this operator to the initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] [1, 0]ᵀ\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]ᵀ\n*   In bra-ket notation, this is |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(ωt/2)|↓⟩_z.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value\n*   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩.\n*   ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩. Since μ_z = γS_z, this is γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.\n*   The operator S_z in matrix form is S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]].\n*   Let's compute ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * ( (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] ) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]ᵀ\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * [cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)]ᵀ\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))\n*   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)\n\n### 5. Determining the Oscillation Frequency\n*   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)\n*   This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of such an oscillation is A*cos(Ωt + φ), where Ω is the angular frequency.\n*   By comparing `γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)` with the general form, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation is Ω = ω.\n*   Since we defined ω = γB, the oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n### Alternative Method: Bohr Frequency\nThe system starts in the state |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z. The new Hamiltonian is H' = -γBS_y. We can express the initial state as a superposition of the eigenstates of H'. The eigenstates of S_y are |↑⟩_y and |↓⟩_y, with corresponding energy eigenvalues E_↑_y = -γBħ/2 and E_↓_y = +γBħ/2.\n\nThe initial state in this new basis is:\n|↑⟩_z = (1/√2)(|↑⟩_y + |↓⟩_y)\n\nThe state evolves as:\n|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ e^(-iE_↑_y t/ħ) |↑⟩_y + e^(-iE_↓_y t/ħ) |↓⟩_y ]\n\nAn observable that does not commute with the Hamiltonian will oscillate at the Bohr frequency, ω_Bohr = ΔE/ħ, where ΔE is the energy difference between the populated states.\nΔE = E_↓_y - E_↑_y = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ\nω_Bohr = (γBħ) / ħ = γB\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency is γB, which is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe user's code failed because the `sympy` library's `JzKet` function is strict about its input types. It expects integers or symbolic fractions (like `sympy.S(1)/2`) for the quantum numbers, not floating-point numbers like `0.5`. This is a common issue with symbolic math libraries that need to maintain precision and symbolic integrity.\n\nHowever, the physical reasoning laid out before and within the code comments is correct. Let's re-iterate the logical steps without relying on the code execution, as the derivation is standard in quantum mechanics.\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** At time t < 0, the magnetic field is **B** = B**k̂** (along +Z). The magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S** is aligned with the field, meaning the system is in its lowest energy state. The Hamiltonian is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γBS_z. The energy levels are E = -γB(m_sħ), where m_s = ±1/2. The lowest energy state corresponds to the highest m_s, which is m_s = +1/2 (assuming γ>0, which is standard). Thus, the initial state at t=0 is the spin-up state along Z, |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩. The expectation value of the spin is ⟨**S**⟩ = (ħ/2) **k̂**.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:** For t > 0, the magnetic field is switched to **B'** = B**ĵ** (along +Y). The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution is H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γBS_y.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution (Larmor Precession):** A magnetic moment in a magnetic field experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the field. The equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin is d⟨**S**⟩/dt = ⟨**μ**⟩ × **B'** = (γ⟨**S**⟩) × **B'**. This describes a precession of the vector ⟨**S**⟩ around the **B'** field (the Y-axis) with an angular frequency vector **ω** = -γ**B'**. The magnitude of this angular frequency is the Larmor frequency, ω_L = |γB|.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of S_z:**\n    *   At t=0, the spin vector points along the +Z axis: ⟨**S**⟩(0) = (0, 0, ħ/2).\n    *   For t>0, this vector precesses around the Y-axis in the XZ-plane with angular frequency ω = γB.\n    *   The angle of rotation at time t is θ = ωt = γBt.\n    *   Using standard rotation of coordinates, the Z-component of the vector at time t will be the initial Z-component projected onto the new Z-axis after rotation.\n    *   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨S_z(0)⟩ * cos(θ) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt).\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:** The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt). This is a value that oscillates in time according to the function cos(γBt). A function of the form cos(ωt) has an angular frequency of ω.\n\n    By comparison, the oscillation frequency is ω = γB.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State (at t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian for the system is `H_initial = -μ · B = -μ_z * B = -γ * B * S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`). The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γ * B * (ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γ * B * (-ħ/2) = +γ * B * (ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lower energy state is `|+z⟩`. Therefore, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian (for t > 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the +Y direction.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ · B = -μ_y * B = -γ * B * S_y`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting the new Hamiltonian, we get:\n        `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment:**\n    *   We need to find the average (expectation value) of `μ_z`, which is `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ * ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n    *   Let's calculate `⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n\n5.  **Method 1: Larmor Precession**\n    *   A classical and semi-classical approach involves the Larmor precession equation for the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩`:\n        `d⟨S⟩/dt = γ * (⟨S⟩ × B)`\n    *   Here, `B = (0, B, 0)`. The equation becomes:\n        `d/dt (⟨S_x⟩, ⟨S_y⟩, ⟨S_z⟩) = γ * (⟨S_y⟩*0 - ⟨S_z⟩*B, ⟨S_z⟩*0 - ⟨S_x⟩*0, ⟨S_x⟩*B - ⟨S_y⟩*0)`\n    *   This gives a set of coupled differential equations:\n        1.  `d⟨S_x⟩/dt = -γB⟨S_z⟩`\n        2.  `d⟨S_y⟩/dt = 0`\n        3.  `d⟨S_z⟩/dt = γB⟨S_x⟩`\n    *   To find the oscillation of `⟨S_z⟩`, we can differentiate equation (3) with respect to time:\n        `d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB * d⟨S_x⟩/dt`\n    *   Now substitute equation (1) into this:\n        `d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB * (-γB⟨S_z⟩) = -(γB)²⟨S_z⟩`\n    *   This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`. By comparing the two, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation `ω` as:\n        `ω = γB`\n\n6.  **Method 2: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation**\n    *   We need to evaluate `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩`.\n    *   The operator `S_y` for a spin-1/2 particle is `(ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   The time evolution operator is `U(t) = exp(i(γBt/ħ)(ħ/2)σ_y) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`.\n    *   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)σ_k`, where `θ = γBt/2` and `k=y`:\n        `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ_y = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n    *   The initial state is `|+z⟩ = [[1], [0]]`.\n    *   The state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|+z⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   Now we calculate the expectation value `⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`. The `S_z` operator is `(ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n        `⟨S_z⟩(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n        `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This is a cosine function of time. The general form is `A cos(ωt + φ)`. By inspection, the angular frequency `ω` is `γB`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth methods show that the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.

Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment `μ` is related to its spin `S` by the vector relation `μ_vec = γ * S_vec`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The problem states `μ = γ*Sz` which is a shorthand for the z-component `μ_z = γ * S_z`.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_vec = B * z_hat` (in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian of the system is `H_initial = -μ_vec . B_vec = - (γ * S_z) * B = -γB * S_z`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`.\n*   The spin operator `S_z` has two eigenvalues: `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are:\n    *   `E_up = -γB * (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2` for the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n    *   `E_down = -γB * (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2` for the spin-down state `|-z>`.\n*   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In the standard basis where `|+z> = [[1],[0]]`, this is our starting point.\n\n### 2. The Change and the New Hamiltonian (t > 0)\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched. The Z-field is turned off, and a new field `B_vec = B * y_hat` (in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n*   \"Suddenly\" means the state of the system does not change at the instant of the switch. So, the state at `t=0+` is still `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n*   For `t > 0`, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian:\n    `H_new = -μ_vec . B_vec = - (γ * S_y) * B = -γB * S_y`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Time Evolution of the Expectation Value\n\nWe want to find the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`. Since `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t)`, we need to find how `<S_z>(t)` evolves in time. We can use the Heisenberg picture for this.\n\n*   In the Heisenberg picture, the expectation value of an operator `A` evolves according to the equation:\n    `d<A>/dt = (1/iħ) * <[A, H]>` (for an operator `A` with no explicit time dependence).\n\n*   Let's apply this to `A = S_z` and `H = H_new = -γB * S_y`:\n    `d<S_z>/dt = (1/iħ) * <[S_z, -γB * S_y]> = (-γB / iħ) * <[S_z, S_y]>`\n\n*   We use the fundamental commutation relation for spin operators: `[S_i, S_j] = iħ * ε_ijk * S_k`.\n    For our case, `[S_z, S_y] = -[S_y, S_z] = -(iħ * S_x) = -iħ * S_x`.\n\n*   Substituting the commutator back into the equation for `d<S_z>/dt`:\n    `d<S_z>/dt = (-γB / iħ) * (-iħ * <S_x>) = γB * <S_x>`. (Equation 1)\n\n*   This equation shows that the rate of change of `<S_z>` depends on `<S_x>`. We need to find how `<S_x>` changes as well. Let's apply the Heisenberg equation to `A = S_x`:\n    `d<S_x>/dt = (1/iħ) * <[S_x, -γB * S_y]> = (-γB / iħ) * <[S_x, S_y]>`\n\n*   The commutator is `[S_x, S_y] = iħ * S_z`.\n\n*   Substituting this in:\n    `d<S_x>/dt = (-γB / iħ) * (iħ * <S_z>) = -γB * <S_z>`. (Equation 2)\n\n### 4. Solving the Equations of Motion\n\nWe now have a system of two coupled first-order differential equations. Let `ω = γB`.\n1.  `d<S_z>/dt = ω * <S_x>`\n2.  `d<S_x>/dt = -ω * <S_z>`\n\nTo find the oscillation frequency of `<S_z>`, we can combine these equations into a single second-order differential equation.\n*   Differentiate Equation 1 with respect to time:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = ω * d<S_x>/dt`\n*   Substitute Equation 2 into this new equation:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = ω * (-ω * <S_z>) = -ω² * <S_z>`\n*   Rearranging gives:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² + ω² * <S_z> = 0`\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The general solution is `<S_z>(t) = C₁cos(ωt) + C₂sin(ωt)`. The angular frequency of oscillation is `ω`.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe angular frequency of oscillation for `<S_z>(t)` is `ω`. We defined `ω = γB`.\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t)`, so it will oscillate with the same frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, where the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis) with the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis oscillates at this frequency.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe calculated frequency `γB` matches option A.\n\nWe can also solve this problem using the Schrödinger picture, which involves expressing the initial state `|+z>` as a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H_new` (which are `|+y>` and `|-y>`), time-evolving the state, and then calculating the expectation value. This method yields the same result: `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`, confirming the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (a spinor).\n    *   The magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin vector operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component of the magnetic moment is `μ_z = γS_z`.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian for the system is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γB * S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with this field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E = -γB * (±ħ/2)`. Assuming `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is the one with the spin pointing in the same direction as the field, which is the `|+z>` state. So, the initial state of the system at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field in the Z direction is turned off, and a new magnetic field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the +Y direction.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H_new = -μ · B = -γB * S_y`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution:**\n    *   The state of the system will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian: `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n    *   We need to find the expectation value (the average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = γ <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    A powerful way to solve this is using the Heisenberg picture, which is equivalent to using Ehrenfest's theorem. The time evolution of the expectation value of an operator `A` is given by:\n    `d<A>/dt = (i/ħ) * <[H, A]>` (for an operator `A` with no explicit time dependence).\n\n    Let's apply this to our observables, `<S_x>`, `<S_y>`, and `<S_z>`. The Hamiltonian is `H = -γBS_y`.\n\n    *   For `<S_z>`:\n        `d<S_z>/dt = (i/ħ) * <[-γBS_y, S_z]> = (-iγB/ħ) * <[S_y, S_z]>`\n        Using the spin commutation relation `[S_y, S_z] = iħS_x`:\n        `d<S_z>/dt = (-iγB/ħ) * (iħ<S_x>) = γB <S_x>`\n\n    *   For `<S_x>`:\n        `d<S_x>/dt = (i/ħ) * <[-γBS_y, S_x]> = (-iγB/ħ) * <[S_y, S_x]>`\n        Using the spin commutation relation `[S_x, S_y] = iħS_z`, which means `[S_y, S_x] = -iħS_z`:\n        `d<S_x>/dt = (-iγB/ħ) * (-iħ<S_z>) = -γB <S_z>`\n\n5.  **Solve the Differential Equations:**\n    We have a system of two coupled first-order differential equations:\n    1) `d<S_z>/dt = γB * <S_x>`\n    2) `d<S_x>/dt = -γB * <S_z>`\n\n    Let's differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * d<S_x>/dt`\n\n    Now, substitute the second equation into this new equation:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * (-γB * <S_z>) = -(γB)² * <S_z>`\n\n    This is the classic equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`. The general solution is `x(t) = A*cos(ωt + φ)`.\n    By comparing the equations, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation `ω` is:\n    `ω = γB`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The expectation value of `S_z`, and therefore the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment `<μ_z> = γ<S_z>`, oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and `ω` is the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency, and the options provided have the units of angular frequency.

The Hamiltonian for this initial situation is H₀ = -**μ** · **B₀**. The energy is minimized when **μ** is parallel to **B₀**. Since **μ** = γ**S** = γS_z **ẑ** and S_z for a spin-1/2 particle can be +ħ/2 (spin-up) or -ħ/2 (spin-down), the energy levels are E = -γS_zB. The lowest energy state (most stable alignment) corresponds to the largest positive value of S_z, which is S_z = +ħ/2. This state is called the spin-up state along the z-axis, denoted as |+z>. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is |ψ(0)> = |+z>.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:**\n    At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to point along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B.

The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down). The corresponding energies are `E = -γB(±ħ/2)`. Assuming `γ` is positive (as is typical for protons, for example), the lowest energy state corresponds to the largest positive eigenvalue of `S_z`, which is `+ħ/2`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is the spin-up eigenstate of `S_z`, which we denote as `|+z>`.\n    *   In the standard `S_z` basis, `|+z> = [[1], [0]]`.

Its state can be described by a two-component spinor.\n    *   The magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_z = B * z_hat`. The Hamiltonian for the system is `H_initial = -μ · B_z = -γB * S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with this field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`. The corresponding energies are `E = -γB(±ħ/2)`.\n    *   For the energy to be minimal, if we assume `γ > 0`, `S_z` must be positive. So the initial state is the spin-up state along the z-axis, denoted as `|+z>`. Its spin eigenvalue is `+ħ/2`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state vector at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Understand the New Situation (for t > 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction: `B_y = B * y_hat`.\n    *   The \"sudden\" change implies that the state of the particle does not change at the instant of the switch.

Let's call the eigenstates of `S_y` as `|+y>` and `|-y>`, with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`, respectively.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues of `H_new` are `E_y = -γB * (eigenvalues of S_y)`.\n        *   `E_+ = -γB(+ħ/2)` corresponding to eigenstate `|+y>`.\n        *   `E_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(+ħ/2)` corresponding to eigenstate `|-y>`.\n    *   The energy difference between these two levels is `ΔE = E_- - E_+ = (γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n\n4.  **Relate Oscillation Frequency to Energy Difference:**\n    *   A quantum system in a superposition of two energy eigenstates `E_+` and `E_-` will exhibit oscillatory behavior for expectation values of observables. The angular frequency of this oscillation is directly related to the energy difference between the states: `Ω = ΔE / ħ`.\n    *   Using the energy difference calculated above: `Ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n    *   This provides the answer directly. The oscillation frequency of any observable that is not conserved under the new Hamiltonian will be `γB`.\n\n5.  **Confirm with Explicit Calculation (Optional but Recommended):**\n    *   First, express the initial state `|+z>` in the `S_y` eigenbasis. The relationship is:\n        `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    *   Now, apply the time evolution operator:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iH_new*t/ħ) * (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n        Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are energy eigenstates:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(-iE_+*t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iE_-*t/ħ)|-y>]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(iγBt/2)|+y> + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y>]`\n    *   We want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment: `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)>`. So we need to calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   To do this, we can express `|ψ(t)>` back in the z-basis.\n        `|+y> = (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>)`\n        `|-y> = (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>)`\n        Substituting these into the expression for `|ψ(t)>` and simplifying using Euler's formulas (`cos(x) = (e^{ix}+e^{-ix})/2`, `sin(x) = (e^{ix}-e^{-ix})/(2i)`) yields:\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n    *   Now calculate `<S_z(t)>`:\n        `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`\n        `<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * S_z * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n        `<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * (cos(γBt/2)(ħ/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)(-ħ/2)|-z>)`\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   Therefore, the average of the z-component of the moment is:\n        `<μ_z(t)> = γ * <S_z(t)> = (γħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   This expression clearly shows an oscillation with an angular frequency `Ω = γB`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, where the expectation value of the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field axis with the Larmor frequency `Ω_L = γB`.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2, so its spin angular momentum operator is `S`. The magnetic moment is `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_vec = B * z_hat` (in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ · B_vec = -γS_z * B`.\n*   The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`.\n*   The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energies are:\n    *   `E_up = -γ(ħ/2)B`\n    *   `E_down = -γ(-ħ/2)B = +γ(ħ/2)B`\n*   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state, `|+z>`.\n*   So, at `t=0`, the state of the system is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The Sudden Change (at t = 0)\n\n*   The magnetic field is suddenly switched from the Z-direction to the Y-direction: `B_vec = B * y_hat`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H_new = -μ · B_vec = -γS_y * B`.\n*   The \"sudden approximation\" in quantum mechanics states that if the Hamiltonian changes instantaneously, the state vector of the system does not have time to change. Therefore, the state of the system just after the change (at `t=0+`) is the same as the state just before: `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution (t > 0)\n\nThe time evolution of the state is governed by the new Hamiltonian `H_new`. There are a few ways to find the oscillation frequency.\n\n#### Method 1: Using the Bohr Frequency Relation\n\nThis is the most direct method. The oscillation frequency of any observable is determined by the energy differences between the populated energy eigenstates.\n1.  The state at `t > 0` will evolve as a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian, `H_new = -γBS_y`.\n2.  The eigenstates of `H_new` are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which we'll call `|+y>` and `|-y>`. Their `S_y` eigenvalues are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`, respectively.\n3.  The energy eigenvalues of `H_new` are:\n    *   `E_{+y} = -γB(+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n    *   `E_{-y} = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n4.  The initial state `|+z>` needs to be expressed in this new energy eigenbasis (`|+y>`, `|-y>`). The relationship is:\n    *   `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n5.  Since our initial state `|ψ(0)>` is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>`, the system will oscillate.\n6.  The angular frequency of oscillation `ω` is given by the Bohr frequency relation: `ω = ΔE / ħ`, where `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two states in the superposition.\n7.  `ΔE = E_{-y} - E_{+y} = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n8.  Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Heisenberg Picture (Precession)\n\nThis method provides a nice classical analogy.\n1.  The time evolution of the expectation value of an operator `A` is given by the Heisenberg equation of motion: `d<A>/dt = (1/iħ) <[A, H]>`.\n2.  Let's look at the expectation value of the spin components. The general equation of motion for the spin vector `S` in a magnetic field `B_vec` is `d<S>/dt = γ(<S> × B_vec)`. This is the equation for Larmor precession.\n3.  This equation describes the spin vector `<S>` precessing around the magnetic field vector `B_vec` with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n4.  In our problem, at `t=0`, the spin is pointing in the +Z direction (`<S> = (ħ/2) z_hat`) and the magnetic field is in the +Y direction (`B_vec = B y_hat`).\n5.  The spin vector will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane.\n6.  The Z-component of the spin, `<S_z>`, will oscillate between `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2` as it rotates. The frequency of this rotation (and thus oscillation) is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n7.  Since the magnetic moment `μ_z = γS_z`, its expectation value `<μ_z>` will also oscillate with the same frequency.\n\n#### Method 3: Schrödinger Picture (Direct Calculation)\n\n1.  Start with the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n2.  The time evolution is `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n3.  `H = -γBS_y`, so `|ψ(t)> = exp(iγBS_y t/ħ) |+z>`.\n4.  Representing the operators and states as matrices in the `S_z` basis (`|+z>` is `[1, 0]T` and `|-z>` is `[0, 1]T`):\n    *   `S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n5.  The time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(iγBS_y t/ħ) = exp( iγBt/ħ * (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] ) = exp( (γBt/2) * [[0, 1], [-1, 0]] )`.\n6.  Using the series expansion `exp(θA) = cos(θ)I + sin(θ)A` for `A = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]`, we get:\n    *   `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n7.  Apply this to the initial state:\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] * [[1], [0]] = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n8.  Now calculate the expectation value of `μ_z = γS_z`:\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n9.  Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n10. The expression `cos(ωt)` describes an oscillation with angular frequency `ω`. By comparison, the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\nAll three methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:**\n    The particle has a spin 1/2 and its magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in an energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian `H_initial = -mu . B_z = -gamma * B * S_z`. Let's assume it's in the spin-up state along the Z-axis, which is the lower energy state if gamma is positive.

The Hamiltonian is then:\n    `H = -(omega * hbar / 2) * sigma_y`\n\n4.  **Determine the time evolution of the state:**\n    The state of the particle at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n    `|psi(t)> = U(t) |psi(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/hbar)` is the time evolution operator.\n    `U(t) = exp(-i * [-(omega * hbar / 2) * sigma_y] * t / hbar)`\n    `U(t) = exp(i * (omega * t / 2) * sigma_y)`\n    We can use the identity `exp(i * a * n . sigma) = cos(a) * I + i * sin(a) * (n . sigma)`, where `n` is a unit vector. Here, `a = omega * t / 2` and `n . sigma = sigma_y`.\n    `U(t) = cos(omega*t/2) * I + i * sin(omega*t/2) * sigma_y`\n    `U(t) = cos(omega*t/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i * sin(omega*t/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(omega*t/2), 0], [0, cos(omega*t/2)]] + [[0, sin(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2), 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(omega*t/2), sin(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2), cos(omega*t/2)]]`\n    Now, we apply this operator to the initial state:\n    `|psi(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [[cos(omega*t/2), sin(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2), cos(omega*t/2)]] * [[1], [0]]`\n    `|psi(t)> = [[cos(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2)]]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment:**\n    The goal is to find the average (expectation value) of `mu_z`, which is `<mu_z(t)>`.\n    `<mu_z(t)> = gamma * <S_z(t)> = gamma * <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>`\n    First, let's find `<S_z(t)>`. The bra vector `<psi(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|psi(t)>`:\n    `<psi(t)| = [cos(omega*t/2), -sin(omega*t/2)]`\n    Now, we compute the full expression:\n    `<S_z(t)> = [cos(omega*t/2), -sin(omega*t/2)] * (hbar/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2)]]`\n    `<S_z(t)> = (hbar/2) * [cos(omega*t/2), -sin(omega*t/2)] * [[cos(omega*t/2)], [sin(omega*t/2)]]`\n    `<S_z(t)> = (hbar/2) * (cos^2(omega*t/2) - sin^2(omega*t/2))`\n    Using the trigonometric double-angle identity `cos(2x) = cos^2(x) - sin^2(x)`, we get:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (hbar/2) * cos(omega*t)`\n\n6.  **Determine the oscillation frequency:**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<mu_z(t)> = gamma * <S_z(t)> = gamma * (hbar/2) * cos(omega*t)`\n    This expression describes an oscillation. The oscillating part is `cos(omega*t)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `omega`.\n    From our definition in step 3, `omega = gamma * B`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector precesses around the applied magnetic field (in this case, the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency `omega = gamma * B`. The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis oscillates at this same frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `gamma * B`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (a spinor).\n*   The magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. This is a vector relationship.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_initial = B * k_hat` (in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for the interaction between the spin and the magnetic field is `H = -μ · B`.\n*   So, the initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = - (γS) · (B * k_hat) = -γB * S_z`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin-up) and `-ħ/2` (spin-down). The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the one with the most negative energy, which is `E_up`. This corresponds to the spin-up state, where the spin angular momentum is aligned with the magnetic field.\n*   So, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is the spin-up state along the z-axis, which we denote as `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In the standard `S_z` basis, this state is represented by the spinor `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n### 2. The Change in the System\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field in the Z direction is turned off, and a new field `B_new = B * j_hat` (in the +Y direction) is turned on. The magnitude `B` is the same.\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the system for `t > 0` is `H_new = -μ · B_new = - (γS) · (B * j_hat) = -γB * S_y`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n\n*   The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. For a time-independent Hamiltonian `H_new`, the solution is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) * |ψ(0)>`\n*   Substituting the new Hamiltonian and the initial state:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γB * S_y) * t / ħ) * |+z>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γB * S_y * t / ħ) * |+z>`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\n\n*   We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)>`.\n*   `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ * <S_z(t)>`.\n*   This problem describes the phenomenon of Larmor precession. The spin vector, initially pointing along the +Z axis, will start to precess around the axis of the new magnetic field (the Y-axis). The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n*   The Larmor frequency is given by `ω_L = γB` (or `|γB|` to be precise, but `γ` and `B` are treated as positive magnitudes here).\n*   The expectation value of the spin vector `<s>` precesses around the `B` field. The equation of motion is `d<s>/dt = γ * <s> x B`.\n*   Let's solve for the components: `<s> = (<S_x>, <S_y>, <S_z>)` and `B = (0, B, 0)`.\n    *   `d<S_z>/dt = γ * (<S_x>B_y - <S_y>B_x) = γB<S_x>`\n    *   `d<S_x>/dt = γ * (<S_y>B_z - <S_z>B_y) = -γB<S_z>`\n*   Taking the derivative of the first equation with respect to time:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * d<S_x>/dt`\n*   Substituting the second equation into this:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * (-γB<S_z>) = -(γB)²<S_z>`\n*   This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`, where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n*   The solution for `<S_z(t)>` will be of the form `A*cos(ωt) + C*sin(ωt)`. Specifically, it is `<S_z(t)> = <S_z(0)> * cos(ωt) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n*   Therefore, the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z(t)> = γ * <S_z(t)> = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n*   The expression `cos(γBt)` shows that the value oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment is the Larmor frequency, which is `γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the Initial State (`t < 0`)**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle, so its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (spinor).\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the `+z` direction. The Hamiltonian of the system is given by `H = -μ · B`, where `μ` is the magnetic moment operator and `B` is the magnetic field vector.\n    *   The magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin operator `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   So, the initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -γS · (B ẑ) = -γBS_z`, where `ẑ` is the unit vector in the z-direction.\n    *   The problem states that the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned with the magnetic field\". This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`.\n    *   The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down). The corresponding energy eigenvalues are `E = -γB(±ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state corresponds to the largest positive eigenvalue of `S_z`, which is `+ħ/2`. This state is called the \"spin-up\" state along the z-axis, denoted as `|+z>`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In the standard `S_z` basis, this state is represented by the vector `[1, 0]`.\n\n2.  **Determine the New Hamiltonian (`t > 0`)**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+y` direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H_new = -γS · (B ŷ) = -γBS_y`, where `ŷ` is the unit vector in the y-direction.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time Evolution of the State**\n    *   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n        `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    *   Substituting the expression for `H_new`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γBS_y) * t / ħ) |+z> = exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ) |+z>`\n    *   The operator `exp(i * θ * S_y / ħ)` represents a rotation of the spin state around the y-axis by an angle `-θ`. Here, `θ = γBt`. So, the state vector `|ψ(t)>` is the initial state `|+z>` rotated around the y-axis by an angle `ωt`, where the angular velocity is `ω = γB`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment**\n    *   We are interested in the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`.\n    *   `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|μ_z|ψ(t)>`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is `<μ_z(t)> = γ <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Let's calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`. We can use the Heisenberg picture for a more intuitive calculation. The operator `S_z` evolves in time as:\n        `S_z(t) = U†(t)S_zU(t) = exp(-i * γBt * S_y / ħ) * S_z * exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ)`\n    *   This transformation corresponds to rotating the `S_z` operator around the y-axis by an angle `θ = γBt`. The vector components transform as:\n        `S_z' = S_z cos(θ) + S_x sin(θ)`\n        `S_x' = S_x cos(θ) - S_z sin(θ)`\n    *   So, `S_z(t) = S_z cos(γBt) + S_x sin(γBt)`. Note: A sign error in the scratchpad, `S_z` rotation gives `S_z cos(θ) + S_x sin(θ)`. Let's re-verify. A positive rotation of the coordinate system by `θ` around y means `z' = z cosθ - x sinθ`. Rotating the vector means `V_z' = V_z cosθ + V_x sinθ`. The Heisenberg evolution `U†SU` corresponds to rotating the operator in the same way as the vector. So, `S_z(t) = S_z cos(γBt) + S_x sin(γBt)`.\n    *   The expectation value is calculated with respect to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`:\n        `<S_z(t)> = <+z| S_z(t) |+z> = <+z| (S_z cos(γBt) + S_x sin(γBt)) |+z>`\n        `<S_z(t)> = cos(γBt) <+z|S_z|+z> + sin(γBt) <+z|S_x|+z>`\n    *   We know `|+z>` is an eigenstate of `S_z` with eigenvalue `ħ/2`, so `<+z|S_z|+z> = ħ/2`.\n    *   The expectation value of `S_x` in the `|+z>` state is zero: `<+z|S_x|+z> = 0`.\n    *   Therefore, `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z(t)> = γ * <S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n    *   This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is `A cos(ωt + φ)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n    *   By comparing `γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)` with the general form, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation as:\n        `ω = γB`\n\nThis frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nFinal Answer matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis is a classic problem in quantum mechanics involving spin precession, also known as Larmor precession. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   A spin-1/2 particle has a magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where **S** is the spin angular momentum operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   The magnetic field is initially **B** = B**k̂** (in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian of the system is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γS_z B.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means its magnetic moment **μ** points in the same direction as **B**, i.e., in the +Z direction. For this to happen, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z⟩, must be positive.\n*   Since μ_z = γS_z, we need ⟨γS_z⟩ > 0.\n    *   For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of S_z are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.\n    *   Let's assume γ is positive (like for a proton). Then we need ⟨S_z⟩ to be positive. This means the particle must be in the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2. This state is commonly denoted as \"spin-up\" or |↑⟩_z.\n*   So, the initial state of the system at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z. In the standard basis where |↑⟩_z = [1, 0]ᵀ and |↓⟩_z = [0, 1]ᵀ, this is simply the vector [1, 0]ᵀ.\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian (t > 0)\n\n*   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B'** = B**ĵ** (in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for t > 0 is H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γB S_y.\n*   The S_y operator in the S_z basis is given by S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n*   So, H' = -γB(ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n\n### 3. Time Evolution\n\nThe state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation:\n|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iH't/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩\n\nWe want to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is ⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t).\n⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩.\n\nWe can solve this in two ways:\n\n#### Method 1: Schrödinger Picture (Evolving the state vector)\n\n1.  **Express the initial state in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian H'.**\n    The eigenstates of H' are the eigenstates of S_y. They are:\n    *   |↑⟩_y = (1/√2) * [1, i]ᵀ (eigenvalue +ħ/2)\n    *   |↓⟩_y = (1/√2) * [1, -i]ᵀ (eigenvalue -ħ/2)\n\n    We express our initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z = [1, 0]ᵀ as a linear combination of these eigenvectors:\n    |↑⟩_z = (1/√2)|↑⟩_y + (1/√2)|↓⟩_y.\n\n2.  **Evolve the state in time.**\n    Let ω = γB. This is the Larmor frequency. The energy eigenvalues of H' are E_± = -γB(±ħ/2) = ∓(ħω/2).\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) * exp(-iE_+t/ħ)|↑⟩_y + (1/√2) * exp(-iE_-t/ħ)|↓⟩_y\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) * exp(iωt/2)|↑⟩_y + (1/√2) * exp(-iωt/2)|↓⟩_y\n\n3.  **Convert back to the S_z basis to calculate ⟨S_z⟩.**\n    Using |↑⟩_y = (1/√2)(|↑⟩_z + i|↓⟩_z) and |↓⟩_y = (1/√2)(|↑⟩_z - i|↓⟩_z), we substitute back into |ψ(t)⟩. After simplification using Euler's formulas (cos(x) = (e^(ix)+e^(-ix))/2, sin(x) = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/2i), we get:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(ωt/2)|↓⟩_z.\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value.**\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩\n    With S_z|↑⟩_z = +(ħ/2)|↑⟩_z and S_z|↓⟩_z = -(ħ/2)|↓⟩_z, we find:\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (cos(ωt/2) * ⟨↑|_z - sin(ωt/2) * ⟨↓|_z) * S_z * (cos(ωt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(ωt/2)|↓⟩_z)\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = cos²(ωt/2) * (ħ/2) + sin²(ωt/2) * (-ħ/2)\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))\n    Using the trigonometric identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)\n\n5.  **Find the oscillation frequency.**\n    The z-component of the magnetic moment is ⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt).\n    Substituting ω = γB, we have:\n    ⟨μ_z⟩(t) = (γħ/2)cos((γB)t)\n\n    The function oscillates with an angular frequency equal to the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine, which is **γB**.\n\n#### Method 2: Heisenberg Picture (Classical Analogy)\n\nThe expectation value of the spin vector ⟨**S**⟩ obeys the classical torque equation:\nd⟨**S**⟩/dt = γ⟨**S**⟩ × **B'**\n\nIn our case, **B'** is along the y-axis, so **B'** = (0, B, 0).\nThe components of the equation are:\n*   d⟨S_x⟩/dt = γ(⟨S_y⟩B - ⟨S_z⟩*0) = -γB⟨S_z⟩ (using right-hand rule for cross product, not just magnitudes)\n*   d⟨S_y⟩/dt = γ(⟨S_z⟩*0 - ⟨S_x⟩*B) = 0\n*   d⟨S_z⟩/dt = γ(⟨S_x⟩*B - ⟨S_y⟩*0) = γB⟨S_x⟩\n\nThis describes the precession of the vector ⟨**S**⟩ around the Y-axis. To find the oscillation frequency of ⟨S_z⟩, we can solve this system.\nTake the time derivative of the third equation:\nd²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB * d⟨S_x⟩/dt\n\nSubstitute the first equation into this:\nd²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB * (-γB⟨S_z⟩) = -(γB)²⟨S_z⟩\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, d²x/dt² = -ω²x, where the angular frequency ω is **γB**.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, ω = γB.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin angular momentum is described by the spin operator $\\vec{S} = (S_x, S_y, S_z)$. The magnetic moment is given by $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{S}$, where $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field $\\vec{B}_{init} = B\\hat{z}$. The interaction Hamiltonian is $H_{init} = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_{init} = -\\gamma B S_z$.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the particle is in its lowest energy state. The eigenvalues of $S_z$ are $+\\hbar/2$ (for the spin-up state $|\\uparrow\\rangle_z$) and $-\\hbar/2$ (for the spin-down state $|\\downarrow\\rangle_z$).\n    *   The energies are $E = -\\gamma B (\\pm \\hbar/2)$. To minimize the energy (assuming $\\gamma$ and $B$ are positive, which is standard), we must maximize the eigenvalue of $S_z$. Thus, the particle is in the spin-up state along the z-axis.\n    *   So, the state of the system at time $t=0$ is $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |\\uparrow\\rangle_z$. The expectation value of the spin is purely in the z-direction: $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle_0 = \\langle\\uparrow|_z \\vec{S} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\hat{z}$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Dynamics after the Change:**\n    *   At $t=0$, the magnetic field is suddenly changed to $\\vec{B}_{new} = B\\hat{y}$.\n    *   For $t > 0$, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian, $H = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_{new} = -\\gamma B S_y$.\n    *   The time evolution of the state vector is given by the Schrödinger equation: $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-iHt/\\hbar} |\\psi(0)\\rangle$.\n    *   Substituting the new Hamiltonian and the initial state, we get:\n        $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-i(-\\gamma B S_y)t/\\hbar} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z = e^{i\\gamma B S_y t/\\hbar} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    *   We want to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$.\n    *   $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle\\psi(t)|S_z|\\psi(t)\\rangle$.\n    *   Let's calculate $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle$. There are a few ways to do this.\n\n    **Method 1: Larmor Precession (Semi-classical approach)**\n    *   The equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector is $\\frac{d\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle}{dt} = \\langle\\vec{\\mu}\\rangle \\times \\vec{B}_{new} = \\gamma \\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle \\times \\vec{B}_{new}$.\n    *   This equation describes the precession of the vector $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle$ around the magnetic field axis ($\\hat{y}$) with an angular frequency $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$.

Its state can be described by a two-component spinor.\n    Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_z` in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with it. The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_i = -μ · B = -μ_z * B = -γ * S_z * B`.\n    The energy levels are `E = -γ * m_s * ħ * B`, where `m_s = ±1/2` are the spin quantum numbers.\n    \"Aligned with the field\" means the particle is in the lowest energy state. Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` is positive, the lowest energy state corresponds to the largest possible value of `m_s`, which is `m_s = +1/2`. This is the spin-up state along the Z-axis.\n    So, the initial state vector at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z`. In the standard basis where `S_z` is diagonal, this is represented by the spinor `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n2.  **Identify the new Hamiltonian for t > 0.**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction. The new field is `B_y`. The magnitude `B` remains the same. The new Hamiltonian `H_f` that governs the time evolution for `t>0` is:\n    `H_f = -μ · B = -μ_y * B = -γ * S_y * B`.\n    The spin operator `S_y` for a spin-1/2 particle is given by `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    So, `H_f = -γ * B * (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the time evolution of the state.**\n    The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t) |ψ(0)⟩ = exp(-i * H_f * t / ħ) * |ψ(0)⟩`.\n    Let's evaluate the time evolution operator `U(t)`:\n    `U(t) = exp(-i * (-γ * B * S_y) * t / ħ) = exp(i * γ * B * t * S_y / ħ)`\n    `U(t) = exp(i * (γ * B * t / 2) * σ_y)`.\n    Let `θ = γ * B * t / 2`. The operator is `exp(i * θ * σ_y)`.\n    Using the property of Pauli matrices that `σ_y^2 = I` (the identity matrix), we can expand the exponential using its Taylor series, which simplifies to:\n    `exp(i * θ * σ_y) = I * cos(θ) + i * σ_y * sin(θ)`.\n    Substituting the matrices for `I` and `σ_y`:\n    `U(t) = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] * cos(γBt/2) + i * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * sin(γBt/2)`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`.\n    Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = [[1], [0]]`:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] * [[1], [0]] = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment.**\n    The z-component of the magnetic moment operator is `μ_z = γ * S_z`.\n    `S_z = (ħ/2) * σ_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    The expectation value `<μ_z>` at time `t` is given by `<ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    First, let's find `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    The bra vector `<ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ(t)⟩`, which is `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]`.\n    `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `= (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `= (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`.\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`, we get:\n    `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    Now, we find the expectation value of the magnetic moment:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the oscillation frequency.**\n    The expression for the average of the z-component of the moment is `<μ_z>(t) = A * cos(ωt)`, where the amplitude is `A = γħ/2` and the angular frequency is `ω = γB`.\n    This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and the frequency `ω = γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe calculated oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   **System:** A spin-1/2 particle. Its state can be described by a 2D complex vector (a spinor).\n*   **Magnetic Moment:** The magnetic moment `μ` is proportional to the spin `S`, given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The notation `mu (= gamma*Sz)` is a common shorthand, implying the relationship is vectorial, `μ = γS`. If we interpreted it literally, the problem would lead to a non-oscillating result, which contradicts the question's premise.\n*   **Initial Field and Hamiltonian:** The magnetic field is `B_initial = (0, 0, B)`. The Hamiltonian of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is `H = -μ · B`.\n    *   `H_initial = -γS · B_initial = -γB S_z`.\n*   **Initial State:** The particle's moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state. The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the eigenstates of `S_z`, which are spin-up `|+z>` and spin-down `|-z>`.\n    *   `S_z |+z> = +(ħ/2) |+z>` -> Energy `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   `S_z |-z> = -(ħ/2) |-z>` -> Energy `E_- = +γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   The lower energy state is `|+z>`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The Change in the System (t ≥ 0)\n\n*   **New Field and Hamiltonian:** The magnetic field is abruptly switched to the +Y direction. The new field is `B_new = (0, B, 0)`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t ≥ 0` is `H_new = -μ · B_new = -γS · (0, B, 0) = -γB S_y`.\n*   The system's state `|ψ(t)>` will now evolve according to this new Hamiltonian.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n\nThe time evolution of a quantum state is governed by the Schrödinger equation, which gives:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i H_new t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\nSubstituting the new Hamiltonian and the initial state:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t / ħ) |+z> = exp(iγB S_y t / ħ) |+z>`\n\nThis operator describes a rotation of the spin state around the Y-axis. The angle of rotation is `θ(t) = -γBt`. The precession of the spin has begun.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\n\nWe need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)>`. To find `<S_z(t)>`, we calculate `<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n\nThere are several ways to do this. A very direct method relies on the energy difference in the new system.\n\n**Method: Using Energy Eigenstates of the New Hamiltonian**\n\n1.  The new Hamiltonian is `H_new = -γB S_y`. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which we'll call `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    *   `S_y |+y> = +(ħ/2) |+y>` -> Energy `E_{+y} = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   `S_y |-y> = -(ħ/2) |-y>` -> Energy `E_{-y} = +γB(ħ/2)`\n\n2.  We express the initial state `|+z>` in terms of the new energy eigenstates:\n    *   `|+z> = (1/√2) |+y> + (1/√2) |-y>`\n\n3.  The state at time `t` is the time-evolved superposition:\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) exp(-iE_{+y} t/ħ) |+y> + (1/√2) exp(-iE_{-y} t/ħ) |-y>`\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) exp(iγBt/2) |+y> + (1/√2) exp(-iγBt/2) |-y>`\n\n4.  The expectation value of an observable `A` in such a superposition will oscillate at a frequency `ω` determined by the energy difference `ΔE = E_{-y} - E_{+y}`.\n    *   `ΔE = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n\n5.  The oscillation frequency is given by the Bohr frequency condition `ω = ΔE / ħ`.\n    *   `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\nThis angular frequency `ω` is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nLet's confirm this by completing the full calculation for `<S_z(t)>`:\nFirst, express `|ψ(t)>` back in the z-basis:\n`|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\nThen, calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`:\n`<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * S_z * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n`<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * ( (ħ/2)cos(γBt/2)|+z> + (ħ/2)sin(γBt/2)|-z> )`\nUsing the orthogonality of `|+z>` and `|-z>`, this simplifies to:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\nFinally, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThe time-dependent part is `cos(ωt)` where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State**:\n    The particle is spin-1/2 and its magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. This means the particle is in the spin-up eigenstate of the `Sz` operator. The Hamiltonian for this initial situation is `H_initial = -mu . B = - (gamma * Sz) * B`. Being \"aligned\" means the system is in the lower energy state, which for a spin-1/2 particle is the `spin-up` state along Z.\n    So, the initial state vector at `t=0` is `|psi(0)> = |+z>`, which is the eigenvector of `Sz` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**:\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution of the system is:\n    `H = -mu . B`\n    Here, `mu` is the magnetic moment vector operator, `mu = gamma * S`, where `S` is the spin vector operator `S = (Sx, Sy, Sz)`.\n    The new magnetic field is `B = B * y_hat` (where `y_hat` is the unit vector in the y-direction).\n    `H = - (gamma * S) . (B * y_hat) = -gamma * B * Sy`\n\n3.  **Time Evolution and Larmor Precession**:\n    The initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H = -gamma * B * Sy`. Therefore, the state will evolve in time according to the Schrödinger equation. This time evolution corresponds to the precession of the spin's expectation value `<S>` around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession.\n\n4.  **Equations of Motion (Heisenberg Picture)**:\n    A clear way to find the oscillation frequency is to look at the time evolution of the expectation values of the spin components using the Ehrenfest theorem, which leads to the classical equation of motion for the expectation values:\n    `d<S>/dt = (1/(iħ)) * <[S, H]>`\n    Substituting `H = -gamma * B * Sy`:\n    `d<Sz>/dt = (1/(iħ)) * <[Sz, -gamma*B*Sy]> = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * <[Sz, Sy]>`\n\n    Using the commutation relation for spin operators, `[Si, Sj] = iħ * ε_ijk * Sk`, we find:\n    `[Sz, Sy] = iħ * ε_zyx * Sx = iħ * (-1) * Sx = -iħ * Sx`\n\n    Substituting this back into the equation for `d<Sz>/dt`:\n    `d<Sz>/dt = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * (-iħ * <Sx>) = gamma * B * <Sx>` (Equation 1)\n\n    Similarly, we find the equation for `d<Sx>/dt`:\n    `d<Sx>/dt = (1/(iħ)) * <[Sx, -gamma*B*Sy]> = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * <[Sx, Sy]>`\n    The commutation relation is `[Sx, Sy] = iħ * Sz`.\n    `d<Sx>/dt = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * (iħ * <Sz>) = -gamma * B * <Sz>` (Equation 2)\n\n5.  **Solving for the Oscillation Frequency**:\n    We now have a pair of coupled first-order differential equations. To solve for `<Sz(t)>`, we can differentiate Equation 1 with respect to time:\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = gamma * B * d<Sx>/dt`\n\n    Now, substitute Equation 2 into this new equation:\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = gamma * B * (-gamma * B * <Sz>)`\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = -(gamma * B)² * <Sz>`\n\n    This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `x'' = -ω²x`. By comparing the two equations, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation `ω`.\n    `ω² = (gamma * B)²`\n    `ω = gamma * B`\n\n    The average of the z-component of the particle's moment is `<mu_z(t)> = gamma * <Sz(t)>`. Since `<Sz(t)>` oscillates with angular frequency `ω = gamma * B`, `<mu_z(t)>` will also oscillate with the same frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe calculated frequency matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle, meaning its spin quantum number is s = 1/2. The z-component of its spin can be either +ħ/2 (spin up) or -ħ/2 (spin down).\n    *   Its magnetic moment is `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator. The z-component of the magnetic moment is `μ_z = γS_z`.\n    *   The particle is initially \"aligned\" with a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. This means the system is in an energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian `H_initial = -μ · B = -μ_z B = -γB S_z`. The lowest energy state corresponds to the magnetic moment being aligned with the field. In this case, since `γ` is typically positive for particles like protons, a positive `μ_z` (spin up) would be a higher energy state. However, \"aligned\" usually implies the spin projection is along the field direction, so the particle is in the spin-up state along the z-axis.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state vector at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`, which is the eigenstate of `S_z` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`. In the standard basis where `|+z> = [1, 0]` and `|-z> = [0, 1]`, this is the vector `[1, 0]`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Dynamics (t ≥ 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction: `B_new = B * y_hat`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H = -μ · B_new = -μ_y B = -γB S_y`.\n    *   The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting the Hamiltonian: `U(t) = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)`.\n\n3.  **Perform the Quantum Mechanical Calculation:**\n    *   Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`.

This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\nThe particle is spin 1/2 and is initially in a magnetic field `B_initial` pointing in the `+z` direction. Its magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with this field. The magnetic moment operator is given by `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin vector operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is `H = -μ · B`.\n\nInitially, `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -γS_z B`.\nThe energy levels are `E = -γB m_s ħ`, where `m_s` can be `+1/2` (for spin-up, `|+z⟩`) or `-1/2` (for spin-down, `|-z⟩`).\n\nThe term \"aligned with the magnetic field\" means the magnetic moment vector points in the same direction as the magnetic field. This is the lower energy state.\nThe z-component of the magnetic moment is `μ_z = γS_z`. For the expectation value to be in the `+z` direction, `<μ_z>` must be positive.\n*   If `γ > 0` (e.g., for a proton), `<μ_z> = γ<S_z>` is positive when `<S_z>` is positive. The state with the maximum positive `<S_z>` is `|+z⟩` (where `<S_z> = +ħ/2`). This state has energy `E = -γB(ħ/2)`, which is the lower energy state.\n*   If `γ < 0` (e.g., for an electron), `<μ_z> = γ<S_z>` is positive when `<S_z>` is negative. The state with the most negative `<S_z>` is `|-z⟩` (where `<S_z> = -ħ/2`). This state has energy `E = -γB(-ħ/2) = |γ|B(ħ/2)`. Wait, let me recheck the energy. `E = -γ<S_z>B`. For the state `|-z>`, `E = -γ(-ħ/2)B = γħB/2`. Since `γ` is negative, this energy is negative, making it the lower energy state.\n\nSo, in either case, the system starts in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian. Let's proceed assuming `γ > 0` and the initial state is `|+z⟩`. We will see that the final frequency doesn't depend on this choice.\nThe initial state at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`. In matrix form, `|+z⟩ = [[1], [0]]`.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian\nAt `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to be `B_new` in the `+y` direction with the same magnitude `B`.\nThe new Hamiltonian for `t>0` is `H = -μ · B_new = -γS_y B`.\nThe spin operator `S_y` is `(ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\nSo, `H = -γB(ħ/2)σ_y`.\nLet's define the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`.\nThe Hamiltonian becomes `H = -(ħω_L/2)σ_y`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\nThe state evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩`.\nSubstituting `H`:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i[-(ħω_L/2)σ_y]t/ħ) |+z⟩`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(i(ω_L t/2)σ_y) |+z⟩`\n\nTo evaluate the matrix exponential `exp(iθσ_y)`, we use the general formula `exp(iθ n · σ) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ) n · σ`, where `n` is a unit vector. Here `θ = ω_L t/2` and `n` is the y-direction vector `(0,1,0)`.\n`exp(i(ω_L t/2)σ_y) = cos(ω_L t/2)I + i sin(ω_L t/2)σ_y`\nwhere `I` is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\nNow, we apply this operator to the initial state `|+z⟩`:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(ω_L t/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(ω_L t/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]] [[1], [0]]`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ω_L t/2) [[1], [0]] + i sin(ω_L t/2) [[0], [i]]`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ω_L t/2) [[1], [0]] + i² sin(ω_L t/2) [[0], [1]]`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ω_L t/2) [[1], [0]] - sin(ω_L t/2) [[0], [1]]`\nIn ket notation, this is:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ω_L t/2)|+z⟩ - sin(ω_L t/2)|-z⟩`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>`.\nWe know `μ_z = γS_z`. So we need to calculate `<S_z>(t)`.\n`<S_z>(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`\nThe operator `S_z` is `(ħ/2)σ_z`, where `σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n`S_z|ψ(t)⟩ = S_z (cos(ω_L t/2)|+z⟩ - sin(ω_L t/2)|-z⟩)`\nSince `S_z|+z⟩ = +(ħ/2)|+z⟩` and `S_z|-z⟩ = -(ħ/2)|-z⟩`:\n`S_z|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ω_L t/2)(ħ/2)|+z⟩ - sin(ω_L t/2)(-ħ/2)|-z⟩`\n`S_z|ψ(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) [cos(ω_L t/2)|+z⟩ + sin(ω_L t/2)|-z⟩]`\n\nNow we compute the inner product `⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`:\n`⟨ψ(t)| = cos(ω_L t/2)⟨+z| - sin(ω_L t/2)⟨-z|`\n`<S_z>(t) = (cos(ω_L t/2)⟨+z| - sin(ω_L t/2)⟨-z|) * (ħ/2) [cos(ω_L t/2)|+z⟩ + sin(ω_L t/2)|-z⟩]`\nUsing the orthonormality of the basis kets (`⟨+z|+z⟩=1`, `⟨-z|-z⟩=1`, `⟨+z|-z⟩=0`):\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) [cos²(ω_L t/2) * 1 - sin²(ω_L t/2) * 1]`\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) [cos²(ω_L t/2) - sin²(ω_L t/2)]`\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) cos(ω_L t)`\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(ω_L t)`\nSubstituting `ω_L = γB`:\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThis is an oscillatory function `cos(ωt)`. The angular frequency of oscillation `ω` is the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine function.\n`ω = γB`\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` precesses around the new magnetic field (`y`-axis) at the Larmor frequency `ω_L = γB`. The projection of this precessing vector onto the `z`-axis oscillates with this frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2 and is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field in the +Z direction.\n*   The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `H = -μ ⋅ B`.\n*   The magnetic moment operator `μ` is proportional to the spin operator `S`, so `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   For a magnetic field `B_z` in the +Z direction, `H = -γS ⋅ (B_z ẑ) = -γB_z Sz`.\n*   The eigenstates of this Hamiltonian are the eigenstates of `Sz`: spin-up `|+z>` with energy `E_+ = -γB_z(ħ/2)` and spin-down `|-z>` with energy `E_- = +γB_z(ħ/2)`.\n*   \"Aligned\" means the particle is in the lowest energy state. Assuming `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is `E_+`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n*   So, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In matrix form, `|+z> = [[1], [0]]`.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian for Time Evolution\n\n*   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the +Y direction.\n*   The new Hamiltonian `H'` that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H' = -μ ⋅ (Bŷ) = -γS ⋅ (Bŷ) = -γB Sy`.\n*   The spin operator `Sy` is given by `Sy = (ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n*   So, `H' = -γB(ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Time Evolution of the State\n\nThe state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation's evolution operator:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-iH't/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n\nThis can be solved in two ways:\n\n**Method A: Using Eigenstates of the New Hamiltonian**\n\n1.  Find the eigenstates of `H'` (which are the eigenstates of `Sy`).\n    *   The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The corresponding normalized eigenvectors are:\n        *   `|+y>` (eigenvalue +ħ/2): `(1/√2) [[1], [i]] = (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>)`\n        *   `|-y>` (eigenvalue -ħ/2): `(1/√2) [[1], [-i]]` -> Let me recheck this from the thought process. My previous calculation gave `(1/√2)[i, 1]`. Let's stick to the rotation operator method which is less prone to error in eigenvector definitions.\n\n**Method B: Using the Rotation Operator (More Direct)**\n\nThe time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ)` can be seen as a rotation operator.\n`U(t) = exp(-i(-γB Sy)t/ħ) = exp(i(γBt)Sy/ħ)`\n\nThis operator represents a rotation around the Y-axis by an angle `θ = -γBt`.\nThe general rotation operator around the Y-axis is `R_y(θ) = exp(-iθSy/ħ) = cos(θ/2)I - i sin(θ/2)σ_y`.\nHere, our evolution operator `U(t)` corresponds to `R_y(-γBt)`.\n`U(t) = cos(-γBt/2)I - i sin(-γBt/2)σ_y = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ_y`\nIn matrix form:\n`U(t) = cos(γBt/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(γBt/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n`U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n\nNow, apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z> = [[1], [0]]`:\n`|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] [[1], [0]]`\n`|ψ(t)> = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\nIn terms of the Z-basis vectors, this is:\n`|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the moment, `<μz(t)>`.\n`<μz(t)> = <ψ(t)| μz |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γSz |ψ(t)> = γ<ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`\n\nFirst, calculate `<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`.\n`Sz = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n`<Sz(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<-z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * (Sz) * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n`Sz` acts on the kets: `Sz|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `Sz|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`.\n`Sz|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)(ħ/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)(-ħ/2)|-z> = (ħ/2)(cos(γBt/2)|+z> + sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n\nNow, take the inner product with `<ψ(t)|`:\n`<Sz(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * (ħ/2)(cos(γBt/2)|+z> + sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\nUsing the orthogonality of the basis vectors (`<+z|+z>=1`, `<+z|-z>=0`, etc.), we get:\n`<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`, we have:\n`<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\n### 5.

The question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is `ω`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe calculated frequency `γB` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the initial state:**\n    The particle is spin-1/2 and is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the `Sz` operator. \"Aligned\" implies the spin projection is along the field, so it's in the \"spin-up\" state with respect to the Z-axis. We denote this state as `|+z>`. In the standard basis where the eigenvectors of `Sz` are `[[1], [0]]` for spin-up and `[[0], [1]]` for spin-down, we have:\n    `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z> = [[1], [0]]`\n\n2.  **Define the Hamiltonian for t > 0:**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with magnitude `B`. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `H = -μ ⋅ B`. The magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The spin operator `S` is given by `(ħ/2)σ`, where `σ` are the Pauli matrices.\n    The magnetic field is `B = (0, B, 0)`.\n    So, `S ⋅ B = Sx*0 + Sy*B + Sz*0 = B*Sy`.\n    The Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -γ(S ⋅ B) = -γB*Sy`.\n    The `Sy` operator is given by `Sy = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    So, `H = -γB(ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n3.  **Find the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian:**\n    The system will evolve according to this new Hamiltonian. The oscillation frequencies of expectation values are determined by the energy differences between the eigenstates of this Hamiltonian. The eigenstates of `H` are the same as the eigenstates of `Sy`.\n    Let's find the eigenvalues of `H`. The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    The corresponding energy eigenvalues are:\n    `E1 = -γB * (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n    `E2 = -γB * (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n    The energy difference between these two states is:\n    `ΔE = E2 - E1 = (γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n\n4.  **Determine the oscillation frequency:**\n    When a quantum system is in a superposition of energy eigenstates (which is the case here, as the initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of `Sy`), the expectation values of observables that don't commute with the Hamiltonian will oscillate. The angular frequency of this oscillation is given by the Bohr frequency rule: `ω = ΔE / ħ`.\n    `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n    This is the angular frequency of the Larmor precession of the spin around the new magnetic field direction (Y-axis).\n\n5.  **Confirm by calculating the expectation value:**\n    Let's explicitly calculate the expectation value of `μz` as a function of time.\n    First, we express the initial state `|+z>` in terms of the eigenstates of `Sy`, which we'll call `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    `|+y> = (1/√2) * [[1], [i]]` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2` for `Sy`)\n    `|-y> = (1/√2) * [[1], [-i]]` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2` for `Sy`)\n    We can write `|+z>` as a linear combination:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n\n    The time evolution of the state is given by `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)>`.\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * ( e^(-iE1*t/ħ)|+y> + e^(-iE2*t/ħ)|-y> )`\n    Substituting `E1 = -γBħ/2` and `E2 = +γBħ/2`, and letting `ω = γB`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * ( e^(-i(-ωħ/2)t/ħ)|+y> + e^(-i(ωħ/2)t/ħ)|-y> )`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * ( e^(iωt/2)|+y> + e^(-iωt/2)|-y> )`\n\n    Now, we want to calculate `<μz(t)> = γ<ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`.\n    We need to express `|ψ(t)>` back in the Z-basis.\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(iωt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + e^(-iωt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [ (e^(iωt/2) + e^(-iωt/2))|+z> + i(e^(iωt/2) - e^(-iωt/2))|-z> ]`\n    Using Euler's identities (`cos(x) = (e^(ix)+e^(-ix))/2`, `sin(x) = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/2i`):\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`\n\n    Now we calculate `<Sz(t)>`:\n    `<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`\n    `= [cos(ωt/2) <+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|] * Sz * [cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>]`\n    Since `Sz|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `Sz|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`,\n    `<Sz(t)> = [cos(ωt/2) <+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|] * [cos(ωt/2)(ħ/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)(-ħ/2)|-z>]`\n    `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`:\n    `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n    The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n    The value of `<μz(t)>` oscillates with a function `cos(ωt)`.

The eigenstates of `Sz` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   The lower energy state is `E_up`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n*   Therefore, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The Change in Hamiltonian (t ≥ 0)\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction (`B_vec = B * y_hat`).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0` is `H_new = -μ · B_vec = -γS · (B * y_hat) = -γB * Sy`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n\nThe state `|ψ(t)>` will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian. An efficient way to find the oscillation frequency is to consider the energy spectrum of the new Hamiltonian.\n\n*   The time evolution of any quantum state can be understood by decomposing it into the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. The eigenstates of `H_new` are the same as the eigenstates of the `Sy` operator, which we denote as `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n*   The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n*   The energy eigenvalues of `H_new` are:\n    *   `E_+y` (for eigenstate `|+y>`): `E_+y = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   `E_-y` (for eigenstate `|-y>`): `E_-y = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`\n*   The initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H_new`. It is a superposition of the new eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>`. The relationship is:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n*   So at `t=0`, the state is `|ψ(0)> = (1/√2)|+y> + (1/√2)|-y>`. It's a superposition of two different energy states.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Oscillation Frequency\n\n*   The time evolution of the state will involve terms oscillating with a frequency determined by the energy difference between the components of the superposition.\n*   According to Bohr's frequency condition, the angular frequency `ω` of the oscillation between two energy states `E1` and `E2` is given by `ω = (E1 - E2) / ħ`.\n*   In our case, the energy difference between the two components of the state is `ΔE = E_-y - E_+y`.\n*   `ΔE = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n*   The oscillation frequency `ω` is therefore:\n    `ω = ΔE / ħ = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\nThis frequency `ω = γB` is known as the Larmor frequency. It is the frequency at which the expectation value of the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field. Since the z-component of the spin is perpendicular to the new field (along Y), its expectation value will oscillate with this Larmor frequency.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe average (expectation value) of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) `γB`\nB) `γB/√2`\nC) `√2 * γB`\nD) `γB/2`\n\nThe calculated frequency matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State of the System:**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, so its spin is described by the spin operators `S_x`, `S_y`, `S_z`.\n    *   The magnetic moment is `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, the magnetic field is `B_initial = B * z_hat` (in the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian for the initial state is `H_initial = -μ . B_initial = -γS . (B * z_hat) = -γB * S_z`.\n    *   The problem states the particle is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state (ground state). The energy is `E = -μ_z * B`. To minimize energy, the z-component of the magnetic moment, `μ_z`, must be positive and aligned with `B`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this means the expectation value of `S_z` must be positive. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`. The state with the lowest energy is the one with the highest `S_z` eigenvalue, which is the spin-up state along the z-axis.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is the eigenstate of `S_z` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`, denoted as `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the field is switched to `B_new = B * y_hat` (in the +Y direction).\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ . B_new = -γS . (B * y_hat) = -γB * S_y`.\n    *   The state of the system will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation with this new Hamiltonian. Any observable `A` that does not commute with this new Hamiltonian will have an expectation value `<A(t)>` that can change over time.\n\n3.  **Oscillation Frequency and Energy Eigenstates:**\n    *   The time evolution of the system is governed by the superposition of the energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H`. The oscillation frequency of any observable is determined by the difference in energy between the eigenstates that are populated in the system.\n    *   The eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H = -γB * S_y` are the same as the eigenstates of the `S_y` operator. Let's call them `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    *   The eigenvalues of the `S_y` operator are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues `E` of the Hamiltonian `H` are:\n        *   For the eigenstate `|+y>` (where `S_y` has eigenvalue `+ħ/2`): `E_+ = -γB * (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`.\n        *   For the eigenstate `|-y>` (where `S_y` has eigenvalue `-ħ/2`): `E_- = -γB * (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`.\n    *   The initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H`. It can be written as a superposition of the new energy eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>`. Specifically, `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`. This means both energy levels, `E_+` and `E_-`, are populated.\n    *   The frequency of oscillation of the expectation value of an operator like `S_z` is given by the Bohr frequency, which is related to the energy difference (`ΔE`) between the populated states:\n        `Ω = ΔE / ħ`\n    *   The energy difference is `ΔE = E_- - E_+ = (γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n    *   The oscillation (angular) frequency is therefore:\n        `Ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`, will oscillate with an angular frequency `Ω = γB`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, where the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) with the Larmor frequency `Ω = γB`.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThis is a classic problem in quantum mechanics involving spin dynamics, specifically Larmor precession. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Initial State (`t < 0`)\n*   A spin-1/2 particle has a magnetic moment `vec(μ) = γ * vec(S)`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `vec(S)` is the spin angular momentum operator.\n*   The particle is in a uniform magnetic field `vec(B) = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -vec(μ) ⋅ vec(B) = - (γ * vec(S)) ⋅ (B * z_hat) = -γ * B * S_z`.\n*   The statement \"the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the magnetic field\" means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the eigenstates of `S_z`, which are spin-up `|+z>` and spin-down `|-z>`.\n    *   `S_z |+z> = +(ħ/2) |+z>`, giving energy `E_up = -γ * B * (ħ/2)`.\n    *   `S_z |-z> = -(ħ/2) |-z>`, giving energy `E_down = -γ * B * (-ħ/2) = +γ * B * (ħ/2)`.\n*   Assuming `γ` is positive (as is typical for protons), the lower energy state is `E_up`, corresponding to the spin-up state `|+z>`. So, the initial state of the system at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. Dynamics for `t > 0`\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to `vec(B) = B * y_hat` (pointing in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H_new = -vec(μ) ⋅ vec(B) = - (γ * vec(S)) ⋅ (B * y_hat) = -γ * B * S_y`.\n*   The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, the solution of which is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γ * B * S_y) * t / ħ) |+z>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γ * B * S_y * t / ħ) |+z>`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Expectation Value\nWe want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = γ * <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n\nThere are two common ways to solve this: the Schrödinger picture (evolving the state) or the Heisenberg picture (evolving the operator). The Heisenberg picture is often more direct for this type of problem.\n\n**Using the Heisenberg Picture:**\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the operators evolve in time, and the state vector remains fixed at `|ψ(0)>`. The equation of motion for an operator `A` is:\n`d(A)/dt = (1/iħ) * [A, H] + ∂A/∂t`\n\nLet's find the equations of motion for the spin operators. Let `ω = γB`. This is the Larmor frequency. The Hamiltonian is `H = -ω * S_y`.\n\n*   **For `S_z`:**\n    `dS_z/dt = (1/iħ) * [S_z, H] = (1/iħ) * [S_z, -ω * S_y] = (-ω/iħ) * [S_z, S_y]`\n    Using the commutation relation `[S_y, S_z] = iħ * S_x`, we get `[S_z, S_y] = -iħ * S_x`.\n    `dS_z/dt = (-ω/iħ) * (-iħ * S_x) = ω * S_x`\n\n*   **For `S_x`:**\n    `dS_x/dt = (1/iħ) * [S_x, H] = (1/iħ) * [S_x, -ω * S_y] = (-ω/iħ) * [S_x, S_y]`\n    Using the commutation relation `[S_x, S_y] = iħ * S_z`.\n    `dS_x/dt = (-ω/iħ) * (iħ * S_z) = -ω * S_z`\n\nNow we have a system of coupled differential equations for the operators:\n1.  `dS_z/dt = ω * S_x`\n2.  `dS_x/dt = -ω * S_z`\n\nTo solve for `S_z(t)`, we can differentiate the first equation and substitute the second:\n`d²S_z/dt² = ω * (dS_x/dt) = ω * (-ω * S_z) = -ω² * S_z`\n`d²S_z/dt² + ω² * S_z = 0`\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The general solution is:\n`S_z(t) = A * cos(ωt) + C * sin(ωt)`\nThe constants `A` and `C` are determined by the initial conditions at `t=0`. Since the operators in the Heisenberg picture at `t=0` are just the Schrödinger picture operators, we have:\n`A = S_z(0) = S_z`\n`C * ω = (dS_z/dt)|_(t=0) = ω * S_x(0) = ω * S_x`. So, `C = S_x`.\nThe full solution for the operator is `S_z(t) = S_z * cos(ωt) + S_x * sin(ωt)`.\n\nNow, we find the expectation value by \"sandwiching\" this operator between the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n`<S_z>(t) = <+z| S_z(t) |+z> = <+z| (S_z * cos(ωt) + S_x * sin(ωt)) |+z>`\n`<S_z>(t) = cos(ωt) * <+z| S_z |+z> + sin(ωt) * <+z| S_x |+z>`\n\nWe need to evaluate the matrix elements:\n*   `<+z| S_z |+z> = ħ/2` (by definition of the `|+z>` state).\n*   `S_x |+z> = (ħ/2)|-z>`. Therefore, `<+z| S_x |+z> = (ħ/2) * <+z|-z> = 0` (because `|+z>` and `|-z>` are orthogonal).\n\nSubstituting these values back:\n`<S_z>(t) = cos(ωt) * (ħ/2) + sin(ωt) * 0 = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe expectation value of the z-component of spin is `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`.\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\nSubstituting `ω = γB`:\n`<μ_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos( (γB) * t)`\n\nThis expression describes an oscillation. The term inside the cosine function is `(γB) * t`, which is of the form `(angular frequency) * t`.\nThus, the angular oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\nThe options provided are:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe calculated oscillation frequency matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:**\n    *   The particle is spin 1/2 with magnetic moment `μ = γS`.\n    *   Initially, there's a magnetic field `B` in the `+z` direction. The particle is \"aligned\" with this field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n    *   The initial Hamiltonian is `H_0 = -μ · B = -γ(S_x B_x + S_y B_y + S_z B_z) = -γB S_z`.\n    *   The eigenstates of `H_0` are the eigenstates of `S_z`, which are spin-up `|↑z>` and spin-down `|↓z>`.\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_↑ = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_↓ = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   The lowest energy state is `E_↑`, corresponding to the spin-up state `|↑z>`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |↑z>`.\n\n2.  **Identify the new Hamiltonian and the dynamics for t > 0:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+y` direction, `B' = B * y_hat`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t>0` is `H = -μ · B' = -γB S_y`.\n    *   The state of the system will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation governed by this new Hamiltonian `H`.\n    *   The state at a later time `t` is given by `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting `H`, we get `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ)|↑z> = exp(iγBt S_y/ħ)|↑z>`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment:**\n    *   We want to find the average (expectation value) of `μ_z`, which is `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|μ_z|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is equivalent to `γ<S_z(t)> = γ<ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`. We need to find the oscillation frequency of this quantity.\n    *   There are a few ways to calculate this. A physically intuitive way is to use the concept of Larmor precession. In the Heisenberg picture, the equation of motion for the spin operator `S` is `dS/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S]`. For `H = -γB S_y`, this leads to `dS/dt = γ(S x B')`. This equation describes the precession of the spin vector `S` around the new magnetic field `B'` (which is along the y-axis) with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n4.  **Visualize the precession:**\n    *   Initially, the spin is pointing along the `+z` direction (`S(0)` is aligned with `z_hat`).\n    *   The magnetic field is now along the `+y` direction.\n    *   The spin vector `S` will precess around the y-axis in the x-z plane.\n    *   The z-component of the spin vector at time `t`, `S_z(t)`, will be the projection of the precessing vector onto the z-axis.\n    *   If the vector `S(0)` of magnitude `S` is initially on the z-axis and precesses around the y-axis with angular frequency `ω`, its projection on the z-axis at time `t` is `S_z(t) = S * cos(ωt)`.\n    *   Therefore, the expectation value `<S_z(t)>` will oscillate as `<S_z(0)> * cos(ωt)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the oscillation frequency:**\n    *   The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`.\n    *   So, the expectation value `<S_z(t)>` oscillates as `cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The full expression is `<S_z(t)> = <↑z|S_z|↑z> * cos(γBt) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The expectation value of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The oscillation is described by the term `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is `γB`.

Identify the Initial State\nThe problem states that a spin-1/2 particle is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n\n*   The magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator.\n*   The initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S_x, S_y, S_z) ⋅ (0, 0, B) = -γB S_z`.\n*   The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   For the magnetic moment to be \"aligned\" with the field (i.e., point in the `+Z` direction), the system must be in the state with the lowest energy. The expectation value of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩`. For `⟨μ_z⟩` to be positive (aligned with `+Z`), we need `γ⟨S_z⟩ > 0`.\n    *   If `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is `|+z⟩` (`E_up` is lower). In this state `⟨S_z⟩ = +ħ/2`, so `⟨μ_z⟩ > 0`.\n    *   If `γ < 0`, the lowest energy state is `|-z⟩` (`E_down` is lower). In this state `⟨S_z⟩ = -ħ/2`, so `⟨μ_z⟩ > 0`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state is an eigenstate of `S_z`. Let's assume the initial state is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`. We will see that the final frequency is independent of this choice.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\nAt `t=0`, the magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched to the `+Y` direction. The \"sudden approximation\" means the state of the particle does not have time to change. So, at `t=0+`, the state is still `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S_x, S_y, S_z) ⋅ (0, B, 0) = -γB S_y`.\n*   The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n*   `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ)|+z⟩ = exp(iγBt S_y / ħ)|+z⟩`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\nWe need to find the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`.\n\n*   `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n*   Substituting `|ψ(t)⟩`, we get:\n    `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ ⟨+z| exp(-iγBt S_y / ħ) S_z exp(iγBt S_y / ħ) |+z⟩`.\n\nThis is a classic example of Larmor precession. The evolution of the expectation value `⟨S⟩` follows the classical equation of motion for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field: `d⟨S⟩/dt = γ⟨S⟩ × B`. This describes the precession of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` around the magnetic field `B` with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n\nLet's calculate this quantum mechanically. The expression `exp(-iθn⋅S/ħ) S_k exp(iθn⋅S/ħ)` represents a rotation of the operator `S_k` around the axis `n` by an angle `θ`.\n\n*   Here, the rotation axis `n` is the Y-axis.\n*   The rotation angle is `θ = γBt`.\n*   The operator `S_z` is rotated around the Y-axis. The rotated operator `S_z(t)` is:\n    `S_z(t) = S_z cos(θ) - S_x sin(θ)`.\n    `S_z(t) = S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt)`.\n\nNow, we compute the expectation value in the initial state `|+z⟩`:\n\n*   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| S_z(t) |+z⟩ = ⟨+z| S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt) |+z⟩`.\n*   This splits into two terms: `cos(γBt)⟨+z| S_z |+z⟩ - sin(γBt)⟨+z| S_x |+z⟩`.\n\nWe need the expectation values of `S_z` and `S_x` in the state `|+z⟩`:\n\n*   `⟨+z| S_z |+z⟩ = ħ/2` (since `|+z⟩` is an eigenstate of `S_z`).\n*   `⟨+z| S_x |+z⟩ = 0` (The expectation value of `S_x` in an eigenstate of `S_z` is zero).\n\nPlugging these values back:\n\n*   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt) - 0 = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\nFinally, we find the expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component:\n\n*   `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\n### 4. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe expression for `⟨μ_z(t)⟩` shows that it oscillates sinusoidally with time. The general form of an oscillation is `cos(ωt)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n\n*   By comparing `cos(γBt)` with `cos(ωt)`, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation as `ω = γB`.\n\nThis frequency is the Larmor frequency. If we had chosen the initial state to be `|-z⟩`, the result would have been `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = -γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`, which has the same oscillation frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nAn analytical step-by-step derivation is provided to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Initial State (t=0):**\n    The problem states that a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment, **μ** = γ**S**, is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction, **B** = B **k̂**. The Hamiltonian for this situation is H = -**μ** · **B** = -γB S_z. Alignment with the field means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate.\n    *   The operator S_z has two eigenstates: spin-up |+z⟩ (eigenvalue +ħ/2) and spin-down |-z⟩ (eigenvalue -ħ/2).\n    *   The corresponding energies are E_up = -γB(ħ/2) and E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2).\n    *   Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio γ is positive (as is common for the intrinsic spin of particles like the electron, though γ_e is negative, the \"γ\" in these problems is often treated as a positive constant), the lowest energy state is the spin-up state, E_up.\n    *   Thus, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is the spin-up state along the Z-axis: |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩. In the standard S_z basis, this state is represented by the column vector `[1, 0]ᵀ`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian (t>0):**\n    Suddenly, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, **B'** = B **ĵ**. The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for t>0 is H' = -**μ** · **B'** = -γB S_y.\n    *   In the S_z basis, the spin operators are represented by the Pauli matrices (multiplied by ħ/2):\n        S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y = (ħ/2) * `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    *   So, the new Hamiltonian is H' = -γB(ħ/2) * `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:**\n    The state of the system evolves according to |ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩, where U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ) is the time evolution operator.\n    *   U(t) = exp[-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ] = exp[iγBt S_y/ħ]\n    *   Substituting S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, we get: U(t) = exp[iγBt(ħ/2)σ_y/ħ] = exp[i(γBt/2)σ_y].\n    *   Using the mathematical identity for Pauli matrices, exp(iθσ_k) = I*cos(θ) + iσ_k*sin(θ), where I is the identity matrix and θ = γBt/2.\n    *   U(t) = I*cos(γBt/2) + iσ_y*sin(γBt/2) = `[[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   Now, we apply this operator to the initial state:\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = `[[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]` * `[1, 0]ᵀ` = `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]ᵀ`\n    *   In bracket notation, the state at time t is: |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩.\n\n4.  **Expectation Value of μ_z:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨γS_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩.\n    *   The expectation value is calculated as ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩.\n    *   The operator S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2) * `[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    *   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]` * (ħ/2)`[[1, 0], [0, -1]]` * `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]ᵀ`\n    *   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]` * `[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)]ᵀ`\n    *   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]\n    *   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n        ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt).\n    *   Therefore, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt).\n\n5.  **Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The expression ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt) describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is A*cos(ωt + φ), where ω is the angular frequency.\n    *   By comparing our result with the general form, we can see that the angular frequency of the oscillation is ω = γB.\n    This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and ω = γB is the Larmor frequency. The question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is this angular frequency.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe calculated frequency is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State (`t < 0`):**\n    *   A magnetic field `B` is in the +Z direction.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with this field. The potential energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is `U = -μ · B`. To be aligned, the moment must be in the lowest energy state.\n    *   The magnetic moment operator is `μ_vec = γ * S_vec`, where `S_vec` is the spin angular momentum operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B = - (γ * S_z) * B`.\n    *   The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the eigenstates of the spin-z operator `S_z`, which are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is `E_up`, corresponding to the spin-up state `|+z>`. So, the initial state of the particle is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`. (Note: even if we assume `γ < 0`, the resulting oscillation frequency remains the same, as shown in the detailed calculation below).\n\n2.  **Sudden Change (`t = 0`):**\n    *   The magnetic field in the Z direction is switched off.\n    *   A new magnetic field of the same magnitude `B` is switched on in the +Y direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution (`t > 0`):**\n    *   The system now evolves under a new Hamiltonian, `H_new`.\n    *   `H_new = -μ · B_new = - (γ * S_vec) · (B * ŷ) = -γB * S_y`.\n    *   The time evolution of the state vector `|ψ(t)>` is governed by the Schrödinger equation, whose solution is `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting `H_new`, we get: `U(t) = exp(-i * (-γB * S_y) * t / ħ) = exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ)`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Expectation Value `<μz>(t)`:**\n    *   We want to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is equivalent to finding `<S_z>(t)` and multiplying by `γ`. So, we need to calculate `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   This is a classic problem of Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector `<S_vec>` will precess around the direction of the new magnetic field (the Y-axis) with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n\n5.  **Larmor Frequency:**\n    *   The Larmor frequency is given by the formula `ω_L = |γB|`.\n    *   As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis (and also the X-axis) will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor frequency.\n    *   Therefore, the oscillation frequency of `<S_z>(t)`, and consequently `<μ_z>(t)`, is `ω = |γB|`. Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive constants as is typical in such problems, the frequency is `γB`.\n\n6.  **Formal Quantum Mechanical Calculation (Optional but confirms the result):**\n    We can solve this formally using the matrix representation of spin operators (Pauli matrices).\n    *   `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    *   `S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    *   Initial state `|+z>` is the vector `[[1], [0]]`.\n    *   The time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ) = exp(i * (γBt/2) * σ_y)`.\n    *   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_n) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)σ_n`, with `θ = γBt/2`:\n        `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ_y = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   The state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|+z> = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   Now we compute `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    *   Finally, the average z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This expression clearly shows an oscillation described by `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both the conceptual understanding of Larmor precession and the detailed quantum mechanical calculation give the same result. The oscillation frequency is `γB`. This corresponds to the Larmor frequency.

Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2, and the magnetic field `B` is in the `+Z` direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_i = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_z B`.\n*   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned with the field\". This means the particle is in the energy eigenstate corresponding to spin-up along Z.\n*   The initial state of the system at `t=0` is the spin-up eigenstate of `S_z`, denoted as `|+z⟩`. In the standard basis where `S_z` is diagonal, this is represented by the column vector `[1, 0]`.\n    `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩ = [1, 0]`\n\n### 2. Dynamics for t > 0\n\n*   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is applied in the `+Y` direction.\n*   The change is \"sudden,\" which means the state vector `|ψ⟩` does not have time to change. Thus, the state at `t=0+` is still `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n*   For `t > 0`, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian: `H_f = -μ ⋅ B_new = -γ(S ⋅ Bŷ) = -γB S_y`.\n*   Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The Hamiltonian simplifies to `H_f = -ω S_y`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n\nThe state at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩ = exp(-iH_f t / ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`\nSubstituting `H_f`:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-ωS_y)t / ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(iωtS_y / ħ) |+z⟩`\n\nTo evaluate the exponential of the `S_y` operator, we use its matrix form `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n`exp(iωtS_y / ħ) = exp(iωt(ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y)`\n\nUsing the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)σ_k`:\n`exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y) = cos(ωt/2)I + i sin(ωt/2)σ_y`\n`= cos(ωt/2)[[1,0],[0,1]] + i sin(ωt/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]]`\n`= [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]`\n\nNow, we apply this evolution operator to our initial state:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] [1, 0]`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value\n\nWe want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, we calculate `⟨S_z(t)⟩`:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`\nUsing the matrix for `S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`:\n\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0],[0, -1]] * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]`\n`= (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * [cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)]`\n`= (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))`\n\nUsing the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n\nThe expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component is:\n`⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n\n### 5. Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe expression for the average z-component of the moment is `γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`. This value oscillates in time according to the function `cos(ωt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\nWe defined the Larmor frequency as `ω = γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nThis physical phenomenon is called Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, `⟨S⟩`, which initially points along the Z-axis, begins to precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis oscillates with this same frequency.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial State\n*   The system consists of a spin-1/2 particle. The magnetic moment is given by the operator `vec(mu) = gamma * vec(S)`, where `vec(S)` is the spin operator and `gamma` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, the particle is in a magnetic field `B` along the +Z direction and is \"aligned with\" it. This means the particle is in its lowest energy state.\n*   The Hamiltonian for this initial setup is `H_initial = -vec(mu) . vec(B) = - (gamma * vec(S)) . (0, 0, B) = -gamma * B * Sz`.\n*   The eigenvalues of `Sz` for a spin-1/2 particle are `+hbar/2` (spin-up, `|+z>`) and `-hbar/2` (spin-down, `|-z>`).\n*   The corresponding energies are `E = -gamma * B * (eigenvalue of Sz)`.\n*   So, `E_up = -gamma*B*hbar/2` and `E_down = gamma*B*hbar/2`.\n*   The lowest energy state (assuming `gamma*B > 0`) is the spin-up state `|+z>`. So, the state of the system at time `t=0` is `|psi(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. Identify the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new field is `vec(B') = (0, B, 0)`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t >= 0` is `H = -vec(mu) . vec(B') = - (gamma * vec(S)) . (0, B, 0) = -gamma * B * Sy`.\n*   The state of the particle will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation, governed by this new Hamiltonian `H`.\n\n### 3. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe oscillation frequency of an expectation value in a quantum system is determined by the energy differences between the populated energy eigenstates.\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Find the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian `H`.**\n    The Hamiltonian is proportional to the spin operator `Sy`. So, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `Sy`, which we can call `|+y>` and `|-y>`. The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+hbar/2` and `-hbar/2`.\n    The energy eigenvalues are:\n    *   `E_+` (corresponding to `|+y>` state): `E_+ = -gamma * B * (+hbar/2) = - (gamma * B * hbar) / 2`\n    *   `E_-` (corresponding to `|-y>` state): `E_- = -gamma * B * (-hbar/2) = + (gamma * B * hbar) / 2`\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Express the initial state in the basis of the new energy eigenstates.**\n    The initial state is `|psi(0)> = |+z>`. We need to express this in the `Sy` eigenbasis. The `Sy` eigenstates are related to the `Sz` eigenstates as follows:\n    *   `|+y> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|+z> + i*|-z>)`\n    *   `|-y> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|+z> - i*|-z>)`\n    By adding these two equations, we get `|+y> + |-y> = sqrt(2) * |+z>`, which means:\n    `|+z> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    This shows that the initial state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Relate the energy difference to the oscillation frequency.**\n    When a system is in a superposition of two energy states with energies `E_a` and `E_b`, any observable that connects these two states will have an expectation value that oscillates with an angular frequency `omega` given by:\n    `omega = |E_a - E_b| / hbar`\n    In our case, the two populated states have energies `E_+` and `E_-`. The energy difference is:\n    `Delta E = E_- - E_+ = [(gamma * B * hbar) / 2] - [- (gamma * B * hbar) / 2] = gamma * B * hbar`\n    The oscillation frequency `omega` is therefore:\n    `omega = Delta E / hbar = (gamma * B * hbar) / hbar = gamma * B`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment, `<mu_z>(t) = gamma * <Sz>(t)`, will oscillate. This oscillation arises from the coherent superposition of the two energy eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>`. The frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, determined by the energy splitting caused by the new magnetic field.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `omega = gamma * B`.\n\nThis corresponds to the classical picture of Larmor precession, where the spin vector precesses about the magnetic field axis (`Y`-axis in this case) with an angular frequency of `gamma * B`. The `z`-component of the spin (and thus the magnetic moment) will oscillate as the cosine of this precessing angle.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   A spin-1/2 particle has a magnetic moment `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   The magnetic field is `B_initial = B * ẑ` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian for this initial system is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B_initial = - (γS) ⋅ (B ẑ) = -γB * Sz`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate. The energy `E = -γB * m_s * ħ`, where `m_s` is the spin quantum number. To minimize energy, we need `m_s` to be as large and positive as possible (assuming `γ` is positive, which is typical for electron spin, `γ_e < 0`, but for nuclei it can be positive. However, the dynamics don't depend on the sign of `γ`). The `Sz` eigenstates are `|+z>` (spin up, eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and `|-z>` (spin down, eigenvalue `-ħ/2`). The \"aligned\" or low-energy state is `|+z>`.\n    *   So, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the System for t ≥ 0:**\n    *   The magnetic field is suddenly changed to `B_final = B * ŷ` (pointing in the +Y direction). The term \"suddenly\" implies that the state of the particle does not have time to change at the instant of the switch. So, the state at `t=0` is still `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for `t ≥ 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B_final = - (γS) ⋅ (B ŷ) = -γB * Sy`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state `|ψ(t)>` will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian `H`: `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n    *   To calculate this, it's easiest to express the initial state `|ψ(0)>` in the basis of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H` (which are the eigenstates of `Sy`).\n    *   The eigenstates of `Sy` are `|+y>` and `|-y>`, with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2` respectively. In the `Sz` basis (`|+z> = (1, 0)`, `|-z> = (0, 1)`), they are:\n        *   `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n        *   `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n    *   We can write the initial state `|+z>` as a superposition of these `Sy` eigenstates:\n        *   `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value `<μz>(t)`:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μz>(t)> = <ψ(t)| μz |ψ(t)> = γ<ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)> = γ<Sz>(t)`. Let's calculate `<Sz>(t)`.\n\n    **Method 1: State Vector Evolution**\n    *   First, find the energy eigenvalues for the Hamiltonian `H = -γB * Sy`.\n        *   `E_+` (for state `|+y>`): `H|+y> = -γB * Sy|+y> = -γB * (ħ/2) * |+y>`. So `E_+ = -γBħ/2`.\n        *   `E_-` (for state `|-y>`): `H|-y> = -γB * Sy|-y> = -γB * (-ħ/2) * |-y>`.

This means the system is in its lowest energy state. The energy is `E = -γB * <S_z>`. To minimize energy, `γ<S_z>` must be maximized. Assuming `γ > 0` (like for a proton), this means `S_z` must be in its highest eigenvalue state, which is `+ħ/2`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is the \"spin-up\" state along the z-axis, denoted as `|+z>`.

This value will oscillate because the initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H`. A quantum system in a state that is a superposition of energy eigenstates will evolve in time, and the expectation values of observables will oscillate with frequencies determined by the energy differences between those eigenstates.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Using Energy Eigenvalues**\n        *   The oscillation frequency `ω` of a two-level system is directly related to the energy difference `ΔE` between its two energy eigenstates by the Bohr frequency condition: `ω = ΔE / ħ`.\n        *   Let's find the eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian `H = -γB * S_y`.\n        *   The eigenvalues of `S_y` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n        *   Therefore, the energy eigenvalues of `H` are `E_1 = -γB * (+ħ/2)` and `E_2 = -γB * (-ħ/2)`.\n        *   So, `E_1 = -γBħ/2` and `E_2 = +γBħ/2`.\n        *   The energy difference is `ΔE = |E_1 - E_2| = |(-γBħ/2) - (γBħ/2)| = |-γBħ| = γBħ` (assuming `γ` and `B` are positive magnitudes).\n        *   The oscillation frequency is `ω = ΔE / ħ = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Direct Calculation of `<μ_z(t)>`**\n        *   We need to calculate `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n        *   The time evolution operator is `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ) = exp(i * γB*t/ħ * S_y)`.\n        *   Let `ω_L = γB` (this is the Larmor Frequency). `U(t) = exp(i * ω_L*t/ħ * S_y) = exp(i * (ω_L*t/2) * σ_y)`.\n        *   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + i*sin(θ)σ_k`, where `θ = ω_L*t/2` and `σ_k = σ_y`:\n            `U(t) = cos(ω_L*t/2) * [[1,0],[0,1]] + i*sin(ω_L*t/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]`\n            `U(t) = [[cos(ω_L*t/2), sin(ω_L*t/2)], [-sin(ω_L*t/2), cos(ω_L*t/2)]]`\n        *   Now, apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = [[1], [0]]`:\n            `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = [[cos(ω_L*t/2)], [-sin(ω_L*t/2)]]`\n        *   This means `|ψ(t)> = cos(ω_L*t/2)|+z> - sin(ω_L*t/2)|-z>`.\n        *   Now we calculate the expectation value of `μ_z = γS_z`:\n            `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)>`.\n            `S_z` is `(ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]`.\n            `<S_z(t)> = [cos(ω_L*t/2), -sin(ω_L*t/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] * [[cos(ω_L*t/2)], [-sin(ω_L*t/2)]]`\n            `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * [cos(ω_L*t/2), -sin(ω_L*t/2)] * [[cos(ω_L*t/2)], [sin(ω_L*t/2)]]`\n            `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ω_L*t/2) - sin²(ω_L*t/2))`\n        *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`, we get:\n            `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(ω_L*t)`.\n        *   So, `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = (γħ/2) * cos(ω_L*t)`.\n        *   The time-dependent term is `cos(ω_L*t)`.

The Hamiltonian for this initial situation is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_z B`. Since the moment is aligned with the field, the particle is in the lowest energy state, which is an eigenstate of the `S_z` operator. For a spin-1/2 particle, this is the \"spin-up\" state with respect to the Z-axis. We denote this state as `|+z>`. So, the state of the system at time t=0 is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`. In the standard basis where `S_z` is diagonal, this state is represented by the vector `[1, 0]^T`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:**\n    At t=0, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S_x B_x + S_y B_y + S_z B_z)`. Since the new field is `B` in the +Y direction, this becomes `H = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:**\n    The state of the particle will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation governed by the new Hamiltonian `H`. The solution is given by:\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)>`\n    Substituting the expression for `H`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ)|+z> = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)|+z>`\n    Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The equation becomes:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(iωtS_y/ħ)|+z>`\n    For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator `S_y` can be written in terms of the Pauli Y-matrix `σ_y`: `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`.\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(iωt(ħ/2)σ_y/ħ)|+z> = exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y)|+z>`\n\n    We can expand the exponential operator using the property `(σ_y)^2 = I` (where I is the identity matrix):\n    `exp(iθσ_y) = I cos(θ) + iσ_y sin(θ)`\n    Here, `θ = ωt/2`. The matrix for `σ_y` in the `S_z` basis is `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    So the time evolution operator `U(t)` is:\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + i sin(ωt/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]`\n\n    Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|+z> = [1, 0]^T`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] [1, 0]^T = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]^T`\n    In bra-ket notation: `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of `μ_z`, which is `<μ_z(t)>`.\n    `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|μ_z|ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)|γS_z|ψ(t)> = γ<S_z(t)>`\n    Let's calculate `<S_z(t)>`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`\n    We know that `S_z|+z> = +(ħ/2)|+z>` and `S_z|-z> = -(ħ/2)|-z>`.\n    `S_z|ψ(t)> = S_z(cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n    `= cos(ωt/2)(ħ/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)(-ħ/2)|-z>`\n    `= (ħ/2)[cos(ωt/2)|+z> + sin(ωt/2)|-z>]`\n    Now we take the inner product with `<ψ(t)| = cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2)(cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|)(cos(ωt/2)|+z> + sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n    Using the orthogonality of the states (`<+z|+z>=1`, `<+z|-z>=0`, etc.), we get:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2)[cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)]`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n    Substituting back `ω = γB`:\n    `<μ_z(t)> = (γħ/2)cos((γB)t)`\n    This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The term inside the cosine function is `(Angular Frequency) * time`. Therefore, the angular frequency of oscillation is `Ω = γB`.\n\nThe options provided are in the format of angular frequency.\n\n**Alternative approach (Classical/Semi-classical picture):**\nThe magnetic field `B` exerts a torque `τ` on the magnetic moment `μ`: `τ = μ x B`.\nThe torque causes a change in the angular momentum `S`: `dS/dt = τ`.\nCombining these, we get the equation of motion for the spin vector: `dS/dt = γS x B`.\nThis equation describes the precession of the spin vector `S` around the magnetic field vector `B`. The frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`.\nInitially, the spin is along the +Z axis. The new field is along the +Y axis. The spin vector will start precessing in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis. The Z-component of the spin vector, `<S_z>`, will oscillate between `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2` with the Larmor frequency.

The oscillation frequency of the system between two states is given by `ω = ΔE/ħ`, where `ΔE` is the energy difference between the eigenstates.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian is `H = -γB S_y`. The operator `S_y` for a spin-1/2 particle has eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues of `H` are therefore:\n        *   `E_+ = -γB (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n        *   `E_- = -γB (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n    *   The energy difference (the energy gap) between these two levels is:\n        *   `ΔE = E_- - E_+ = (γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n    *   The oscillation frequency `ω` is given by the relation `ω = ΔE/ħ`.\n        *   `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n    *   This frequency `ω` is the Larmor frequency. Any observable whose operator is not diagonal in the energy eigenbasis will oscillate at this frequency. `S_z` is not diagonal in the eigenbasis of `S_y`, so `⟨S_z(t)⟩` will oscillate with frequency `γB`.\n\n5.  **Method 2: Full State Vector Evolution (Schrödinger Picture)**\n    *   Let's explicitly calculate the state `|ψ(t)⟩` and then `⟨S_z(t)⟩`.\n    *   The operator `S_y` is given by the Pauli matrix `σ_y`: `S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y = (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   The time evolution operator is `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ) = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) = exp(iγBS_y t/ħ)`.\n    *   We can write this as `U(t) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`.\n    *   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = I cos(θ) + iσ_k sin(θ)`, with `k=y` and `θ = γBt/2`:\n        *   `U(t) = I cos(γBt/2) + iσ_y sin(γBt/2)`\n        *   `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`.

So, the initial state for the new evolution is still `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n*   For `t > 0`, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian, `H = -μ ⋅ B_y = -γB S_y`.\n*   The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation, and the state at a later time `t` is given by `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n*   Substituting the new Hamiltonian, we get `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(iγBt S_y/ħ) |+z⟩`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value\n*   We need to find the average (which means the quantum mechanical expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `μ_z = γS_z`.\n*   The expectation value is `<μ_z>(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n*   Let's focus on calculating `<S_z>(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n\n### Method 1: Using Rotation Operators\n*   The operator `exp(iθ S_y/ħ)` represents a rotation of the state by an angle `θ` around the y-axis.\n*   In our case, the angle of rotation is `θ(t) = γBt`.\n*   The state `|ψ(t)⟩` is the initial state `|+z⟩` rotated by an angle `γBt` around the y-axis.\n*   Classical intuition helps here: a spin vector `S` pointing along Z, when subjected to a magnetic field along Y, will precess in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis.\n*   The projection of the spin vector onto the Z-axis will be `S_z(t) = |S| cos(ωt)`.\n*   The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n*   The quantum mechanical expectation value follows the classical motion. The initial expectation value is `<S_z>(0) = ⟨+z|S_z|+z⟩ = ħ/2`.\n*   Therefore, the expectation value at time `t` will be `<S_z>(t) = <S_z>(0) cos(ωt) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n*   Then, the expectation value of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n*   This is a sinusoidal oscillation with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n### Method 2: Energy Eigenstate Decomposition\n*   The new Hamiltonian is `H = -γBS_y`. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which are `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`.\n    *   `S_y |±y⟩ = ±(ħ/2) |±y⟩`.\n*   The energy eigenvalues are `E_± = -γB(±ħ/2)`. So, `E_+ = -γBħ/2` (for `|+y⟩`) and `E_- = +γBħ/2` (for `|-y⟩`).\n*   Any oscillation in the system will have a frequency related to the difference in energy eigenvalues: `ω = ΔE/ħ`.\n*   `ΔE = |E_- - E_+| = |(+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2)| = |γBħ| = γBħ` (assuming γ and B are positive).\n*   The oscillation frequency is `ω = ΔE/ħ = (γBħ)/ħ = γB`.\n*   This method works because the initial state `|+z⟩` is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`. Specifically, `|+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2`. Since both energy levels are populated in the initial state, the system will exhibit oscillations at the frequency corresponding to their energy difference.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth methods show that the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates according to `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\nMatching this with the given options:\nA) gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin 1/2 system, so its state can be described by a two-component spinor.\n*   The magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The spin operator `S` has components `Sx`, `Sy`, and `Sz`.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction: **B** = (0, 0, B).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(Sz * B)`.\n*   The particle's moment is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state, which is the eigenstate of `Sz` with positive spin projection. Let's call this state `|↑z⟩`.\n*   In the basis of `Sz` eigenstates, `|↑z⟩ = [1, 0]` and `|↓z⟩ = [0, 1]`. The initial state is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |↑z⟩`.\n*   The z-component of the spin operator in this basis is `Sz = (ħ/2) * σz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n*   For the initial state, the expectation value of `Sz` is `⟨ψ(0)|Sz|ψ(0)⟩ = ħ/2`.\n\n### 2. Understanding the New Dynamics\n\n*   At time t=0, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction: **B'** = (0, B, 0).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H = -μ ⋅ B' = -γB * Sy`.\n*   The spin operator in the y-direction is `Sy = (ħ/2) * σy = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n*   The state of the particle `|ψ(t)⟩` will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation with this new Hamiltonian `H`: `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Time Evolution of the State (Schrödinger Picture)\n\n*   Substitute `H` into the evolution operator: `U(t) = exp(-i(-γB * Sy)t / ħ) = exp(i * γBt * Sy / ħ)`.\n*   The term `γB` has units of angular frequency. Let's define the Larmor frequency as `ω = γB`.\n*   The evolution operator becomes `U(t) = exp(i * ωt * Sy / ħ)`. Substituting the matrix for `Sy`:\n    `U(t) = exp(i * ωt * (ħ/2) * σy / ħ) = exp(i * (ωt/2) * σy)`.\n*   We use the identity `exp(iθσk) = cos(θ)I + i*sin(θ)σk`, where `I` is the identity matrix and `σk` is a Pauli matrix.\n*   Here, `θ = ωt/2`. So,\n    `U(t) = cos(ωt/2) * I + i*sin(ωt/2) * σy`\n    `U(t) = cos(ωt/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i*sin(ωt/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + [[0, sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]` (This is a rotation matrix around the y-axis).\n*   Now, we find the state at time `t`: `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`.\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] * [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]]`\n*   In terms of the basis states, `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2)|↑z⟩ - sin(ωt/2)|↓z⟩`.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value of the Moment\n\n*   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μz⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|μz|ψ(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)⟩`.\n*   First, let's find `⟨Sz⟩(t)`.\n    `Sz|ψ(t)⟩ = Sz * (cos(ωt/2)|↑z⟩ - sin(ωt/2)|↓z⟩)`\n    `Sz|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2) * Sz|↑z⟩ - sin(ωt/2) * Sz|↓z⟩`\n    `Sz|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2) * (ħ/2)|↑z⟩ - sin(ωt/2) * (-ħ/2)|↓z⟩`\n    `Sz|ψ(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * (cos(ωt/2)|↑z⟩ + sin(ωt/2)|↓z⟩)`\n*   Now take the inner product with `⟨ψ(t)| = cos(ωt/2)⟨↑z| - sin(ωt/2)⟨↓z|`:\n    `⟨Sz⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)⟩`\n    `⟨Sz⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2)⟨↑z| - sin(ωt/2)⟨↓z|] * [cos(ωt/2)|↑z⟩ + sin(ωt/2)|↓z⟩]`\n*   Using the orthogonality of the basis states (`⟨↑z|↑z⟩=1`, `⟨↓z|↓z⟩=1`, `⟨↑z|↓z⟩=0`), we get:\n    `⟨Sz⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)]`\n*   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we have:\n    `⟨Sz⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`.\n*   Now, find the expectation value of the magnetic moment component:\n    `⟨μz⟩(t) = γ⟨Sz⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`.\n\n### 5. Identifying the Oscillation Frequency\n\n*   The average of the z-component of the moment is `⟨μz⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n*   The function `cos(Ωt)` describes an oscillation with angular frequency `Ω`.\n*   By comparing `cos(γBt)` with the general form `cos(Ωt)`, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation is `Ω = γB`.\n*   This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency. It describes the precession of the magnetic moment around the external magnetic field.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is `γB`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   **System:** A spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment vector **μ** related to its spin vector **S** by **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   **Initial Condition:** The particle is in a magnetic field **B_i** = B **ẑ** (pointing in the +Z direction). The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate.\n*   **Initial Hamiltonian:** The energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by the Hamiltonian H = -**μ** · **B**.\n    So, the initial Hamiltonian is H_i = - (γ**S**) · (B **ẑ**) = -γB S_z.\n*   **Eigenstates and Energies:** The operator S_z has two eigenstates for a spin-1/2 particle: spin-up |+>_z and spin-down |->_z.\n    *   S_z |+>_z = +(ħ/2) |+>_z, giving energy E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)\n    *   S_z |->_z = -(ħ/2) |->_z, giving energy E_- = +γB(ħ/2)\n*   **Initial State Vector:** \"Aligned with the field\" means the magnetic moment points in the same direction as the field (+Z), which corresponds to the spin-up state |+>_z. This is also the state of minimum energy (assuming γ > 0).\n    So, at t=0, the state of the particle is |ψ(0)> = |+>_z. In the standard S_z basis, this is represented by the column vector `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Time Evolution (t > 0)\n\n*   **New Condition:** At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B_f** = B **ŷ** (pointing in the +Y direction).\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** The Hamiltonian governing the system for t > 0 is H = -**μ** · **B_f** = -γB S_y.\n*   **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle at any time t > 0 is given by the Schrödinger equation's solution:\n    |ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)> = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>\n    Substituting H = -γB S_y, we get:\n    |ψ(t)> = e^(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |+>_z = e^(iγBS_yt/ħ) |+>_z\n\n### 3. Calculating the State Vector at Time t\n\nTo compute the evolution, we use the matrix representations in the S_z basis:\n*   The spin-y operator is S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli Y-matrix: σ_y = `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n*   The time evolution operator becomes: U(t) = e^(iγB(ħ/2)σ_y t/ħ) = e^(i(γBt/2)σ_y).\n*   We use the property of Pauli matrices: e^(iθσ_n) = I cos(θ) + iσ_n sin(θ), where I is the identity matrix.\n    Here, the angle θ = γBt/2 and the operator is σ_y.\n    U(t) = I cos(γBt/2) + iσ_y sin(γBt/2)\n    U(t) = `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` cos(γBt/2) + i `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]` sin(γBt/2)\n    U(t) = `[[cos(γBt/2), 0], [0, cos(γBt/2)]]` + `[[0, sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), 0]]`\n    U(t) = `[[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n*   Now, we find the state vector |ψ(t)>:\n    |ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)> = `[[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]` `[[1], [0]]`\n    |ψ(t)> = `[[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n\nThis means |ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2) |+>_z - sin(γBt/2) |->_z.\n\n### 4. Finding the Expectation Value of μ_z\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency of the *average* of the z-component of the particle's moment. The average is the quantum mechanical expectation value, `<μ_z(t)>`.\n*   <μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ <S_z(t)>\n*   We calculate <S_z(t)>:\n    <S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>\n    The S_z operator is S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)`[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    <S_z(t)> = `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]` * (ħ/2)`[[1, 0], [0, -1]]` * `[[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    <S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]` * `[[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    <S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]\n*   Using the trigonometric identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n    <S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)\n*   Therefore, the expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component is:\n    <μ_z(t)> = γ <S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)\n\n### 5. Identifying the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe expression for <μ_z(t)> is of the form A*cos(ωt), where A is the amplitude and ω is the angular frequency of oscillation.\nFrom <μ_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt), we can see that the angular frequency is:\nω = γB\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin's expectation value precesses around the new magnetic field direction (**ŷ**) at the Larmor frequency, ω_L = γB. The projection of this precessing vector onto the z-axis oscillates with this frequency.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State:**\n    The problem states that a spin-1/2 particle is initially \"aligned\" with a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state of the initial Hamiltonian `H_initial = -μ_z * B = -γ * S_z * B`. For a positive gyromagnetic ratio `γ`, the lowest energy corresponds to the spin pointing in the direction of the field. This is the spin-up state along the Z-axis. In Dirac notation, the initial state at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |↑z>`, which is the eigenstate of the spin operator `S_z` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian:**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution of the system is:\n    `H = -μ · B = -μ_y * B = -γ * S_y * B`\n    Here, `S_y` is the spin operator for the Y-direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:**\n    The state of the system `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The solution is given by:\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)>`\n    where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian `H`:\n    `U(t) = exp(-i(-γ * S_y * B)t / ħ) = exp(i * γ * B * t * S_y / ħ)`\n    So, the state at time `t` is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γ * B * t * S_y / ħ) |↑z>`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`.\n    `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)>`\n    Substituting the expression for `|ψ(t)>`:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <↑z| exp(-i * γ * B * t * S_y / ħ) * S_z * exp(i * γ * B * t * S_y / ħ) |↑z>`\n\n5.  **Simplify using Larmor Precession (Conceptual Approach):**\n    This problem describes a classic phenomenon known as Larmor precession. The torque `τ` on a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `τ = μ x B`. For spin, this translates to the equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector `<S>`:\n    `d<S>/dt = γ (<S> x B)`\n    This equation shows that the spin vector `<S>` precesses (rotates) around the direction of the magnetic field `B`.\n    *   The direction of precession is around the Y-axis (the direction of the new field `B`).\n    *   The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n    *   `ω_L = γB`\n\n    The initial spin vector is pointing along the +Z axis: `<S>(0) = <↑z| S |↑z> = (ħ/2) * ẑ`.\n    As this vector precesses around the Y-axis with angular frequency `ω_L = γB`, its components change. The z-component of the spin vector at time `t` is given by the projection of the precessing vector onto the Z-axis:\n    `<S_z>(t) = |<S>(0)| * cos(ω_L * t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    Therefore, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n6.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The expression for `<μ_z>(t)` is `γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. This is a cosine function of time `t`. The general form of an oscillation is `A*cos(ωt + φ)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n    By comparing `cos(γBt)` with `cos(ωt)`, we can directly identify the angular oscillation frequency `ω` as:\n    `ω = γB`\n\n7.  **Match with Options:**\n    The calculated oscillation frequency is `γB`.

However, the output you've provided, `hbar*gamma*hbar*cos(hbar*B*gamma*t)/2`, appears to be physically incorrect due to a dimensional inconsistency. Let's analyze why.\n\n**Analysis of the Provided Output:**\n\n1.  The argument of any trigonometric function (like cosine) must be dimensionless.\n2.  Let's check the units of the term inside the cosine, `hbar*B*gamma*t`:\n    *   The gyromagnetic ratio `gamma` (`γ`) has units of inverse-Tesla-seconds (`1 / (T·s)`).\n    *   The magnetic field `B` has units of Tesla (`T`).\n    *   Time `t` has units of seconds (`s`).\n    *   The reduced Planck constant `hbar` (`ħ`) has units of Joule-seconds (`J·s`).\n3.  Combining these, the units of `hbar*B*gamma*t` are:\n    `(J·s) * (T) * (1 / (T·s)) * (s) = J·s` (Joule-seconds)\n4.  Since `J·s` is not a dimensionless quantity, the expression `cos(hbar*B*gamma*t)` is physically invalid.

    "This is a classic problem of Larmor precession in quantum mechanics. Let's analyze the reasoning provided by the different methods to find the most consistent answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Reasoning Methods\n\n1.  **Initial State and Hamiltonian:** All methods correctly identify that the particle starts in the spin-up state along the Z-axis, `|+z⟩`, which is the lowest energy state for the initial Hamiltonian `H_initial = -γB S_z`. They also correctly identify that after the field is switched to the Y-axis, the new Hamiltonian governing the system's evolution is `H = -γB S_y`.\n\n2.  **Methods for Finding the Frequency:**\n    *   **Larmor Precession (Semi-classical/Heisenberg Picture):** Many answers (e.g., 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, etc.) use the concept of Larmor precession. The time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` is governed by `d⟨S⟩/dt = γ⟨S⟩ × B`. This describes a precession of the spin vector around the new magnetic field (the Y-axis) with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. The z-component of the spin, being perpendicular to the field, will oscillate at this frequency. This is a very direct and physically intuitive method.\n\n    *   **Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation (Schrödinger Picture):** Many answers (e.g., 2, 4, 9, 10, etc.) perform the full quantum mechanical calculation. They evolve the initial state `|+z⟩` using the time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ) = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)`. They then calculate the expectation value of `μ_z = γS_z` at time `t`, which results in `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. From the argument of the cosine function, the angular frequency of oscillation `ω` is immediately identified as `γB`.\n\n    *   **Bohr Frequency (Energy Eigenvalue Method):** Several answers (e.g., 2, 11, 12, 19) use a third, very elegant method. They find the energy eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian `H = -γB S_y`. The two energy levels are found to be `E_+ = -γBħ/2` and `E_- = +γBħ/2`. Since the initial state `|+z⟩` is a superposition of the new energy eigenstates, the system oscillates with an angular frequency given by the energy difference `ΔE = E_- - E_+ = γBħ`. The Bohr frequency relation `ω = ΔE/ħ` then directly gives `ω = γB`.\n\n### Conclusion on Consistency\n\n*   **Consistency of Derivations:** There is overwhelming consistency across all valid reasoning methods. Every single method presented (Larmor Precession, Schrödinger Picture, Bohr Frequency) correctly and independently derives the same result: the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n*   **Inconsistency in Final Answer Labels:** The provided answers show significant inconsistency in the final `<<<X>>>` label. This appears to be due to different (or shuffled) option lists used when each answer was generated. For example, some answers label `γB` as `A`, some as `B`, some as `C`, and some as `D`. However, the physical conclusion of the reasoning is always the same.\n\nGiven that the core task is to select the *most consistent answer* based on the provided logic, the answer must be the one derived consistently by every physical method.

Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle, meaning its spin angular momentum `S` has a z-component `Sz` with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down).\n*   Its magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component of the magnetic moment is `μz = γSz`.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_initial = B * ẑ` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian (energy operator) of the particle in this field is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S ⋅ B_initial) = -γB * Sz`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n    *   The energy for spin up (`|+z>`) is `E_up = -γB * (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`.\n    *   The energy for spin down (`|-z>`) is `E_down = -γB * (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`.\n*   The lowest energy state is the spin-up state, `|+z>`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The Change in the System\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field along the Z-axis is turned off, and a new magnetic field `B_final = B * ŷ` (pointing in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n*   For all `t > 0`, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian: `H' = -μ ⋅ B_final = -γ(S ⋅ B_final) = -γB * Sy`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the System\n\nThe problem asks for the oscillation of the *average* (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μz(t)>`. This can be found in two ways.\n\n#### Method 1: Larmor Precession (Classical Analogy)\n\nThis is the most direct method. The time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector, `<S>`, in a magnetic field `B` is governed by the equation:\n`d<S>/dt = γ * <S> x B`\n\nThis equation describes the precession of the vector `<S>` around the magnetic field vector `B` with an angular frequency known as the **Larmor frequency**, `ω_L`.\n\n*   **Larmor Frequency:** `ω_L = γ * |B|`\n*   In our case, the new field has magnitude `B`, so the precession frequency is `ω_L = γB`.\n*   **Initial Spin Vector:** At `t=0`, the state is `|+z>`. The expectation value of the spin vector is `<S(0)> = <+z|S|+z>`.\n    *   `<Sx(0)> = <+z|Sx|+z> = 0`\n    *   `<Sy(0)> = <+z|Sy|+z> = 0`\n    *   `<Sz(0)> = <+z|Sz|+z> = ħ/2`\n    *   So, initially, `<S(0)> = (ħ/2) * ẑ`. The spin vector points along the Z-axis.\n*   **Precession:** For `t>0`, the spin vector `<S(t)>` precesses around the new magnetic field `B_final = B * ŷ`. This means `<S(t)>` rotates in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis.\n*   **Z-Component Oscillation:** As the vector `<S(t)>` rotates in the X-Z plane, its projection onto the Z-axis, `<Sz(t)>`, will oscillate. The frequency of this rotation is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n*   Therefore, `<Sz(t)>` oscillates as `<Sz(t)> = <Sz(0)> * cos(ω_L * t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γB * t)`.\n*   The z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μz(t)> = γ * <Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γB * t)`.\n*   The angular frequency of this oscillation is `γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation\n\n1.  **Express Initial State in New Basis:** The new Hamiltonian `H'` is proportional to `Sy`. We need to express the initial state `|+z>` in the eigenbasis of `Sy`. The eigenstates of `Sy` are:\n    *   `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n    *   `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n    Inverting these gives:\n    *   `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    So, `|ψ(t=0)> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n\n2.  **Apply Time Evolution:** The state at a later time `t` is `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iH't/ħ)|ψ(0)>`. Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are eigenstates of `H'`, this is straightforward.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues for `H' = -γB*Sy` are `E'_+ = -γB(ħ/2)` for `|+y>` and `E'_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)` for `|-y>`.\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(-iE'_+t/ħ)|+y> + e^(-iE'_-t/ħ)|-y> ]`\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(iγBt/2)|+y> + e^(-iγBt/2)|-y> ]`\n\n3.  **Calculate Expectation Value `<Sz(t)>`:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `|+y>` and `|-y>` back into `|ψ(t)>`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>` (After simplification, as shown in the thought process).\n    *   Now calculate `<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`:\n        `<Sz(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * Sz * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n    *   Using `Sz|±z> = ±(ħ/2)|±z>` and the orthogonality of the states:\n        `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n    *   Using the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n        `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n4.  **Find Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the spin is `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The term oscillates with the form `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω` is `γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods show that the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n*   The particle is spin-1/2 and has a magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where **S** is the spin angular momentum operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field **B₀** = B **ẑ** (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state. The interaction Hamiltonian is H₀ = -**μ** ⋅ **B₀** = -γS_z B.\n*   The eigenvalues of S_z are +ħ/2 (spin-up) and -ħ/2 (spin-down). The corresponding energy levels are E = -γ(±ħ/2)B. Assuming γ > 0, the lower energy state corresponds to S_z = +ħ/2.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is the spin-up eigenstate along the z-axis, denoted as |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z. In the standard S_z basis, this state is represented by the vector [1, 0]ᵀ.\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian (t ≥ 0)\n*   At t=0, the Z-field is turned off, and a new field **B'** = B **ŷ** (pointing in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n*   The new Hamiltonian governing the system's evolution for t ≥ 0 is H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γ**S** ⋅ (B **ŷ**) = -γB S_y.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n*   The state of the particle at a later time t is given by the Schrödinger equation: |ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩, where U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ) is the time evolution operator.\n*   Substituting H', we get:\n    U(t) = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t / ħ) = exp(i(γBt)S_y / ħ)\n*   Let's define the Larmor frequency, ω = γB. The evolution operator becomes:\n    U(t) = exp(iωt S_y / ħ)\n*   For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operators are related to the Pauli matrices (σ) by **S** = (ħ/2)**σ**. So, S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y.\n    U(t) = exp(iωt (ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y)\n*   We can use the identity for the exponential of a Pauli matrix: exp(iaσ_k) = cos(a)I + i sin(a)σ_k.\n    Here, a = ωt/2 and k = y.\n    U(t) = cos(ωt/2)I + i sin(ωt/2)σ_y\n*   In the S_z basis, σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] and I = [[1, 0], [0, 1]].\n    U(t) = cos(ωt/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(ωt/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n    U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + [[0, sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), 0]]\n    U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]\n*   Now, we apply this operator to the initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] [1, 0]ᵀ\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]ᵀ\n*   In bra-ket notation, this is |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(ωt/2)|↓⟩_z.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value\n*   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩.\n*   ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩. Since μ_z = γS_z, this is γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.\n*   The operator S_z in matrix form is S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]].\n*   Let's compute ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * ( (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] ) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]ᵀ\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * [cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)]ᵀ\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))\n*   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)\n\n### 5. Determining the Oscillation Frequency\n*   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)\n*   This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of such an oscillation is A*cos(Ωt + φ), where Ω is the angular frequency.\n*   By comparing `γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)` with the general form, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation is Ω = ω.\n*   Since we defined ω = γB, the oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n### Alternative Method: Bohr Frequency\nThe system starts in the state |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z. The new Hamiltonian is H' = -γBS_y. We can express the initial state as a superposition of the eigenstates of H'. The eigenstates of S_y are |↑⟩_y and |↓⟩_y, with corresponding energy eigenvalues E_↑_y = -γBħ/2 and E_↓_y = +γBħ/2.\n\nThe initial state in this new basis is:\n|↑⟩_z = (1/√2)(|↑⟩_y + |↓⟩_y)\n\nThe state evolves as:\n|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ e^(-iE_↑_y t/ħ) |↑⟩_y + e^(-iE_↓_y t/ħ) |↓⟩_y ]\n\nAn observable that does not commute with the Hamiltonian will oscillate at the Bohr frequency, ω_Bohr = ΔE/ħ, where ΔE is the energy difference between the populated states.\nΔE = E_↓_y - E_↑_y = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ\nω_Bohr = (γBħ) / ħ = γB\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency is γB, which is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe user's code failed because the `sympy` library's `JzKet` function is strict about its input types. It expects integers or symbolic fractions (like `sympy.S(1)/2`) for the quantum numbers, not floating-point numbers like `0.5`. This is a common issue with symbolic math libraries that need to maintain precision and symbolic integrity.\n\nHowever, the physical reasoning laid out before and within the code comments is correct. Let's re-iterate the logical steps without relying on the code execution, as the derivation is standard in quantum mechanics.\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** At time t < 0, the magnetic field is **B** = B**k̂** (along +Z). The magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S** is aligned with the field, meaning the system is in its lowest energy state. The Hamiltonian is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γBS_z. The energy levels are E = -γB(m_sħ), where m_s = ±1/2. The lowest energy state corresponds to the highest m_s, which is m_s = +1/2 (assuming γ>0, which is standard). Thus, the initial state at t=0 is the spin-up state along Z, |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩. The expectation value of the spin is ⟨**S**⟩ = (ħ/2) **k̂**.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:** For t > 0, the magnetic field is switched to **B'** = B**ĵ** (along +Y). The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution is H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γBS_y.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution (Larmor Precession):** A magnetic moment in a magnetic field experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the field. The equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin is d⟨**S**⟩/dt = ⟨**μ**⟩ × **B'** = (γ⟨**S**⟩) × **B'**. This describes a precession of the vector ⟨**S**⟩ around the **B'** field (the Y-axis) with an angular frequency vector **ω** = -γ**B'**.

Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment `μ` is related to its spin `S` by the vector relation `μ_vec = γ * S_vec`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The problem states `μ = γ*Sz` which is a shorthand for the z-component `μ_z = γ * S_z`.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_vec = B * z_hat` (in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian of the system is `H_initial = -μ_vec . B_vec = - (γ * S_z) * B = -γB * S_z`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`.\n*   The spin operator `S_z` has two eigenvalues: `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are:\n    *   `E_up = -γB * (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2` for the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n    *   `E_down = -γB * (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2` for the spin-down state `|-z>`.\n*   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In the standard basis where `|+z> = [[1],[0]]`, this is our starting point.\n\n### 2. The Change and the New Hamiltonian (t > 0)\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched. The Z-field is turned off, and a new field `B_vec = B * y_hat` (in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n*   \"Suddenly\" means the state of the system does not change at the instant of the switch. So, the state at `t=0+` is still `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n*   For `t > 0`, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian:\n    `H_new = -μ_vec . B_vec = - (γ * S_y) * B = -γB * S_y`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Time Evolution of the Expectation Value\n\nWe want to find the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`. Since `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t)`, we need to find how `<S_z>(t)` evolves in time. We can use the Heisenberg picture for this.\n\n*   In the Heisenberg picture, the expectation value of an operator `A` evolves according to the equation:\n    `d<A>/dt = (1/iħ) * <[A, H]>` (for an operator `A` with no explicit time dependence).\n\n*   Let's apply this to `A = S_z` and `H = H_new = -γB * S_y`:\n    `d<S_z>/dt = (1/iħ) * <[S_z, -γB * S_y]> = (-γB / iħ) * <[S_z, S_y]>`\n\n*   We use the fundamental commutation relation for spin operators: `[S_i, S_j] = iħ * ε_ijk * S_k`.\n    For our case, `[S_z, S_y] = -[S_y, S_z] = -(iħ * S_x) = -iħ * S_x`.\n\n*   Substituting the commutator back into the equation for `d<S_z>/dt`:\n    `d<S_z>/dt = (-γB / iħ) * (-iħ * <S_x>) = γB * <S_x>`. (Equation 1)\n\n*   This equation shows that the rate of change of `<S_z>` depends on `<S_x>`. We need to find how `<S_x>` changes as well. Let's apply the Heisenberg equation to `A = S_x`:\n    `d<S_x>/dt = (1/iħ) * <[S_x, -γB * S_y]> = (-γB / iħ) * <[S_x, S_y]>`\n\n*   The commutator is `[S_x, S_y] = iħ * S_z`.\n\n*   Substituting this in:\n    `d<S_x>/dt = (-γB / iħ) * (iħ * <S_z>) = -γB * <S_z>`. (Equation 2)\n\n### 4. Solving the Equations of Motion\n\nWe now have a system of two coupled first-order differential equations. Let `ω = γB`.\n1.  `d<S_z>/dt = ω * <S_x>`\n2.  `d<S_x>/dt = -ω * <S_z>`\n\nTo find the oscillation frequency of `<S_z>`, we can combine these equations into a single second-order differential equation.\n*   Differentiate Equation 1 with respect to time:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = ω * d<S_x>/dt`\n*   Substitute Equation 2 into this new equation:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = ω * (-ω * <S_z>) = -ω² * <S_z>`\n*   Rearranging gives:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² + ω² * <S_z> = 0`\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The general solution is `<S_z>(t) = C₁cos(ωt) + C₂sin(ωt)`. The angular frequency of oscillation is `ω`.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe angular frequency of oscillation for `<S_z>(t)` is `ω`. We defined `ω = γB`.\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t)`, so it will oscillate with the same frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, where the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis) with the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis oscillates at this frequency.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe calculated frequency `γB` matches option A.\n\nWe can also solve this problem using the Schrödinger picture, which involves expressing the initial state `|+z>` as a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H_new` (which are `|+y>` and `|-y>`), time-evolving the state, and then calculating the expectation value. This method yields the same result: `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`, confirming the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (a spinor).\n    *   The magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin vector operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component of the magnetic moment is `μ_z = γS_z`.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian for the system is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γB * S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with this field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E = -γB * (±ħ/2)`. Assuming `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is the one with the spin pointing in the same direction as the field, which is the `|+z>` state. So, the initial state of the system at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field in the Z direction is turned off, and a new magnetic field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the +Y direction.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H_new = -μ · B = -γB * S_y`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution:**\n    *   The state of the system will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian: `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n    *   We need to find the expectation value (the average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = γ <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    A powerful way to solve this is using the Heisenberg picture, which is equivalent to using Ehrenfest's theorem. The time evolution of the expectation value of an operator `A` is given by:\n    `d<A>/dt = (i/ħ) * <[H, A]>` (for an operator `A` with no explicit time dependence).\n\n    Let's apply this to our observables, `<S_x>`, `<S_y>`, and `<S_z>`. The Hamiltonian is `H = -γBS_y`.\n\n    *   For `<S_z>`:\n        `d<S_z>/dt = (i/ħ) * <[-γBS_y, S_z]> = (-iγB/ħ) * <[S_y, S_z]>`\n        Using the spin commutation relation `[S_y, S_z] = iħS_x`:\n        `d<S_z>/dt = (-iγB/ħ) * (iħ<S_x>) = γB <S_x>`\n\n    *   For `<S_x>`:\n        `d<S_x>/dt = (i/ħ) * <[-γBS_y, S_x]> = (-iγB/ħ) * <[S_y, S_x]>`\n        Using the spin commutation relation `[S_x, S_y] = iħS_z`, which means `[S_y, S_x] = -iħS_z`:\n        `d<S_x>/dt = (-iγB/ħ) * (-iħ<S_z>) = -γB <S_z>`\n\n5.  **Solve the Differential Equations:**\n    We have a system of two coupled first-order differential equations:\n    1) `d<S_z>/dt = γB * <S_x>`\n    2) `d<S_x>/dt = -γB * <S_z>`\n\n    Let's differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * d<S_x>/dt`\n\n    Now, substitute the second equation into this new equation:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * (-γB * <S_z>) = -(γB)² * <S_z>`\n\n    This is the classic equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`. The general solution is `x(t) = A*cos(ωt + φ)`.\n    By comparing the equations, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation `ω` is:\n    `ω = γB`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The expectation value of `S_z`, and therefore the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment `<μ_z> = γ<S_z>`, oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and `ω` is the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency, and the options provided have the units of angular frequency.

The Hamiltonian for this initial situation is H₀ = -**μ** · **B₀**. The energy is minimized when **μ** is parallel to **B₀**. Since **μ** = γ**S** = γS_z **ẑ** and S_z for a spin-1/2 particle can be +ħ/2 (spin-up) or -ħ/2 (spin-down), the energy levels are E = -γS_zB. The lowest energy state (most stable alignment) corresponds to the largest positive value of S_z, which is S_z = +ħ/2. This state is called the spin-up state along the z-axis, denoted as |+z>.

The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down). The corresponding energies are `E = -γB(±ħ/2)`. Assuming `γ` is positive (as is typical for protons, for example), the lowest energy state corresponds to the largest positive eigenvalue of `S_z`, which is `+ħ/2`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is the spin-up eigenstate of `S_z`, which we denote as `|+z>`.\n    *   In the standard `S_z` basis, `|+z> = [[1], [0]]`.

The frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`.\n    *   In our problem, the spin starts along the Z-axis (`S(0) = (0, 0, S_z)`), and the new field is along the Y-axis (`B = (0, B, 0)`). The spin vector will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane.\n    *   The projection of the precessing vector onto the Z-axis will vary sinusoidally (specifically, as a cosine function since it starts fully along Z). The frequency of this variation is the precession frequency.\n    *   Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component is the Larmor frequency, `Ω = γB`.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.

Time Evolution (t > 0)\n\nThe time evolution of the state is governed by the new Hamiltonian `H_new`. There are a few ways to find the oscillation frequency.\n\n#### Method 1: Using the Bohr Frequency Relation\n\nThis is the most direct method. The oscillation frequency of any observable is determined by the energy differences between the populated energy eigenstates.\n1.  The state at `t > 0` will evolve as a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian, `H_new = -γBS_y`.\n2.  The eigenstates of `H_new` are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which we'll call `|+y>` and `|-y>`. Their `S_y` eigenvalues are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`, respectively.\n3.  The energy eigenvalues of `H_new` are:\n    *   `E_{+y} = -γB(+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n    *   `E_{-y} = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n4.  The initial state `|+z>` needs to be expressed in this new energy eigenbasis (`|+y>`, `|-y>`). The relationship is:\n    *   `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n5.  Since our initial state `|ψ(0)>` is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>`, the system will oscillate.\n6.  The angular frequency of oscillation `ω` is given by the Bohr frequency relation: `ω = ΔE / ħ`, where `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two states in the superposition.\n7.  `ΔE = E_{-y} - E_{+y} = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n8.  Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Heisenberg Picture (Precession)\n\nThis method provides a nice classical analogy.\n1.  The time evolution of the expectation value of an operator `A` is given by the Heisenberg equation of motion: `d<A>/dt = (1/iħ) <[A, H]>`.\n2.  Let's look at the expectation value of the spin components. The general equation of motion for the spin vector `S` in a magnetic field `B_vec` is `d<S>/dt = γ(<S> × B_vec)`. This is the equation for Larmor precession.\n3.  This equation describes the spin vector `<S>` precessing around the magnetic field vector `B_vec` with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n4.  In our problem, at `t=0`, the spin is pointing in the +Z direction (`<S> = (ħ/2) z_hat`) and the magnetic field is in the +Y direction (`B_vec = B y_hat`).\n5.  The spin vector will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane.\n6.  The Z-component of the spin, `<S_z>`, will oscillate between `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2` as it rotates. The frequency of this rotation (and thus oscillation) is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n7.  Since the magnetic moment `μ_z = γS_z`, its expectation value `<μ_z>` will also oscillate with the same frequency.\n\n#### Method 3: Schrödinger Picture (Direct Calculation)\n\n1.  Start with the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n2.  The time evolution is `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n3.  `H = -γBS_y`, so `|ψ(t)> = exp(iγBS_y t/ħ) |+z>`.\n4.  Representing the operators and states as matrices in the `S_z` basis (`|+z>` is `[1, 0]T` and `|-z>` is `[0, 1]T`):\n    *   `S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n5.  The time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(iγBS_y t/ħ) = exp( iγBt/ħ * (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] ) = exp( (γBt/2) * [[0, 1], [-1, 0]] )`.\n6.  Using the series expansion `exp(θA) = cos(θ)I + sin(θ)A` for `A = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]`, we get:\n    *   `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n7.  Apply this to the initial state:\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] * [[1], [0]] = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n8.  Now calculate the expectation value of `μ_z = γS_z`:\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n9.  Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n10. The expression `cos(ωt)` describes an oscillation with angular frequency `ω`. By comparison, the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\nAll three methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:**\n    The particle has a spin 1/2 and its magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in an energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian `H_initial = -mu . B_z = -gamma * B * S_z`. Let's assume it's in the spin-up state along the Z-axis, which is the lower energy state if gamma is positive. This state, denoted as `|+z>`, can be represented by the column vector:\n    `|psi(t=0)> = |+z> = [[1], [0]]`\n\n2.  **Identify the new Hamiltonian:**\n    At time t=0, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution of the system is:\n    `H = -mu . B_y = -gamma * B * S_y`\n    where `S_y` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\n3.  **Represent the spin operator:**\n    For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operators are related to the Pauli matrices (`sigma`) by `S = (hbar/2) * sigma`.\n    `S_y = (hbar/2) * sigma_y = (hbar/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `S_z = (hbar/2) * sigma_z = (hbar/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    The Hamiltonian becomes:\n    `H = -gamma * B * (hbar/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    Let's define the Larmor frequency, `omega = gamma * B`. The Hamiltonian is then:\n    `H = -(omega * hbar / 2) * sigma_y`\n\n4.  **Determine the time evolution of the state:**\n    The state of the particle at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n    `|psi(t)> = U(t) |psi(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/hbar)` is the time evolution operator.\n    `U(t) = exp(-i * [-(omega * hbar / 2) * sigma_y] * t / hbar)`\n    `U(t) = exp(i * (omega * t / 2) * sigma_y)`\n    We can use the identity `exp(i * a * n . sigma) = cos(a) * I + i * sin(a) * (n . sigma)`, where `n` is a unit vector. Here, `a = omega * t / 2` and `n . sigma = sigma_y`.\n    `U(t) = cos(omega*t/2) * I + i * sin(omega*t/2) * sigma_y`\n    `U(t) = cos(omega*t/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i * sin(omega*t/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(omega*t/2), 0], [0, cos(omega*t/2)]] + [[0, sin(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2), 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(omega*t/2), sin(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2), cos(omega*t/2)]]`\n    Now, we apply this operator to the initial state:\n    `|psi(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [[cos(omega*t/2), sin(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2), cos(omega*t/2)]] * [[1], [0]]`\n    `|psi(t)> = [[cos(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2)]]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment:**\n    The goal is to find the average (expectation value) of `mu_z`, which is `<mu_z(t)>`.\n    `<mu_z(t)> = gamma * <S_z(t)> = gamma * <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>`\n    First, let's find `<S_z(t)>`. The bra vector `<psi(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|psi(t)>`:\n    `<psi(t)| = [cos(omega*t/2), -sin(omega*t/2)]`\n    Now, we compute the full expression:\n    `<S_z(t)> = [cos(omega*t/2), -sin(omega*t/2)] * (hbar/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2)]]`\n    `<S_z(t)> = (hbar/2) * [cos(omega*t/2), -sin(omega*t/2)] * [[cos(omega*t/2)], [sin(omega*t/2)]]`\n    `<S_z(t)> = (hbar/2) * (cos^2(omega*t/2) - sin^2(omega*t/2))`\n    Using the trigonometric double-angle identity `cos(2x) = cos^2(x) - sin^2(x)`, we get:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (hbar/2) * cos(omega*t)`\n\n6.  **Determine the oscillation frequency:**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<mu_z(t)> = gamma * <S_z(t)> = gamma * (hbar/2) * cos(omega*t)`\n    This expression describes an oscillation. The oscillating part is `cos(omega*t)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `omega`.\n    From our definition in step 3, `omega = gamma * B`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector precesses around the applied magnetic field (in this case, the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency `omega = gamma * B`. The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis oscillates at this same frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `gamma * B`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (a spinor).\n*   The magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. This is a vector relationship.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_initial = B * k_hat` (in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for the interaction between the spin and the magnetic field is `H = -μ · B`.\n*   So, the initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = - (γS) · (B * k_hat) = -γB * S_z`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin-up) and `-ħ/2` (spin-down). The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the one with the most negative energy, which is `E_up`. This corresponds to the spin-up state, where the spin angular momentum is aligned with the magnetic field.\n*   So, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is the spin-up state along the z-axis, which we denote as `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In the standard `S_z` basis, this state is represented by the spinor `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n### 2. The Change in the System\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field in the Z direction is turned off, and a new field `B_new = B * j_hat` (in the +Y direction) is turned on. The magnitude `B` is the same.\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the system for `t > 0` is `H_new = -μ · B_new = - (γS) · (B * j_hat) = -γB * S_y`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n\n*   The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. For a time-independent Hamiltonian `H_new`, the solution is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) * |ψ(0)>`\n*   Substituting the new Hamiltonian and the initial state:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γB * S_y) * t / ħ) * |+z>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γB * S_y * t / ħ) * |+z>`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\n\n*   We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)>`.\n*   `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ * <S_z(t)>`.\n*   This problem describes the phenomenon of Larmor precession. The spin vector, initially pointing along the +Z axis, will start to precess around the axis of the new magnetic field (the Y-axis). The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n*   The Larmor frequency is given by `ω_L = γB` (or `|γB|` to be precise, but `γ` and `B` are treated as positive magnitudes here).\n*   The expectation value of the spin vector `<s>` precesses around the `B` field. The equation of motion is `d<s>/dt = γ * <s> x B`.\n*   Let's solve for the components: `<s> = (<S_x>, <S_y>, <S_z>)` and `B = (0, B, 0)`.\n    *   `d<S_z>/dt = γ * (<S_x>B_y - <S_y>B_x) = γB<S_x>`\n    *   `d<S_x>/dt = γ * (<S_y>B_z - <S_z>B_y) = -γB<S_z>`\n*   Taking the derivative of the first equation with respect to time:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * d<S_x>/dt`\n*   Substituting the second equation into this:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * (-γB<S_z>) = -(γB)²<S_z>`\n*   This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`, where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n*   The solution for `<S_z(t)>` will be of the form `A*cos(ωt) + C*sin(ωt)`. Specifically, it is `<S_z(t)> = <S_z(0)> * cos(ωt) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n*   Therefore, the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z(t)> = γ * <S_z(t)> = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n*   The expression `cos(γBt)` shows that the value oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n### 5.

The Hamiltonian of the system is given by `H = -μ · B`, where `μ` is the magnetic moment operator and `B` is the magnetic field vector.\n    *   The magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin operator `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   So, the initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -γS · (B ẑ) = -γBS_z`, where `ẑ` is the unit vector in the z-direction.\n    *   The problem states that the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned with the magnetic field\". This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`.\n    *   The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down). The corresponding energy eigenvalues are `E = -γB(±ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state corresponds to the largest positive eigenvalue of `S_z`, which is `+ħ/2`. This state is called the \"spin-up\" state along the z-axis, denoted as `|+z>`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In the standard `S_z` basis, this state is represented by the vector `[1, 0]`.\n\n2.  **Determine the New Hamiltonian (`t > 0`)**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+y` direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H_new = -γS · (B ŷ) = -γBS_y`, where `ŷ` is the unit vector in the y-direction.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time Evolution of the State**\n    *   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n        `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    *   Substituting the expression for `H_new`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γBS_y) * t / ħ) |+z> = exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ) |+z>`\n    *   The operator `exp(i * θ * S_y / ħ)` represents a rotation of the spin state around the y-axis by an angle `-θ`. Here, `θ = γBt`. So, the state vector `|ψ(t)>` is the initial state `|+z>` rotated around the y-axis by an angle `ωt`, where the angular velocity is `ω = γB`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment**\n    *   We are interested in the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`.\n    *   `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|μ_z|ψ(t)>`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is `<μ_z(t)> = γ <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Let's calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`. We can use the Heisenberg picture for a more intuitive calculation. The operator `S_z` evolves in time as:\n        `S_z(t) = U†(t)S_zU(t) = exp(-i * γBt * S_y / ħ) * S_z * exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ)`\n    *   This transformation corresponds to rotating the `S_z` operator around the y-axis by an angle `θ = γBt`. The vector components transform as:\n        `S_z' = S_z cos(θ) + S_x sin(θ)`\n        `S_x' = S_x cos(θ) - S_z sin(θ)`\n    *   So, `S_z(t) = S_z cos(γBt) + S_x sin(γBt)`. Note: A sign error in the scratchpad, `S_z` rotation gives `S_z cos(θ) + S_x sin(θ)`. Let's re-verify. A positive rotation of the coordinate system by `θ` around y means `z' = z cosθ - x sinθ`. Rotating the vector means `V_z' = V_z cosθ + V_x sinθ`. The Heisenberg evolution `U†SU` corresponds to rotating the operator in the same way as the vector. So, `S_z(t) = S_z cos(γBt) + S_x sin(γBt)`.\n    *   The expectation value is calculated with respect to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`:\n        `<S_z(t)> = <+z| S_z(t) |+z> = <+z| (S_z cos(γBt) + S_x sin(γBt)) |+z>`\n        `<S_z(t)> = cos(γBt) <+z|S_z|+z> + sin(γBt) <+z|S_x|+z>`\n    *   We know `|+z>` is an eigenstate of `S_z` with eigenvalue `ħ/2`, so `<+z|S_z|+z> = ħ/2`.\n    *   The expectation value of `S_x` in the `|+z>` state is zero: `<+z|S_x|+z> = 0`.\n    *   Therefore, `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z(t)> = γ * <S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n    *   This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is `A cos(ωt + φ)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n    *   By comparing `γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)` with the general form, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation as:\n        `ω = γB`\n\nThis frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nFinal Answer matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis is a classic problem in quantum mechanics involving spin precession, also known as Larmor precession. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   A spin-1/2 particle has a magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where **S** is the spin angular momentum operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   The magnetic field is initially **B** = B**k̂** (in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian of the system is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γS_z B.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means its magnetic moment **μ** points in the same direction as **B**, i.e., in the +Z direction. For this to happen, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z⟩, must be positive.\n*   Since μ_z = γS_z, we need ⟨γS_z⟩ > 0.\n    *   For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of S_z are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.\n    *   Let's assume γ is positive (like for a proton). Then we need ⟨S_z⟩ to be positive. This means the particle must be in the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2. This state is commonly denoted as \"spin-up\" or |↑⟩_z.\n*   So, the initial state of the system at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z. In the standard basis where |↑⟩_z = [1, 0]ᵀ and |↓⟩_z = [0, 1]ᵀ, this is simply the vector [1, 0]ᵀ.\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian (t > 0)\n\n*   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B'** = B**ĵ** (in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for t > 0 is H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γB S_y.\n*   The S_y operator in the S_z basis is given by S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n*   So, H' = -γB(ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n\n### 3. Time Evolution\n\nThe state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation:\n|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iH't/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩\n\nWe want to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is ⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t).\n⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩.\n\nWe can solve this in two ways:\n\n#### Method 1: Schrödinger Picture (Evolving the state vector)\n\n1.  **Express the initial state in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian H'.**\n    The eigenstates of H' are the eigenstates of S_y. They are:\n    *   |↑⟩_y = (1/√2) * [1, i]ᵀ (eigenvalue +ħ/2)\n    *   |↓⟩_y = (1/√2) * [1, -i]ᵀ (eigenvalue -ħ/2)\n\n    We express our initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z = [1, 0]ᵀ as a linear combination of these eigenvectors:\n    |↑⟩_z = (1/√2)|↑⟩_y + (1/√2)|↓⟩_y.\n\n2.  **Evolve the state in time.**\n    Let ω = γB. This is the Larmor frequency. The energy eigenvalues of H' are E_± = -γB(±ħ/2) = ∓(ħω/2).\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) * exp(-iE_+t/ħ)|↑⟩_y + (1/√2) * exp(-iE_-t/ħ)|↓⟩_y\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) * exp(iωt/2)|↑⟩_y + (1/√2) * exp(-iωt/2)|↓⟩_y\n\n3.  **Convert back to the S_z basis to calculate ⟨S_z⟩.**\n    Using |↑⟩_y = (1/√2)(|↑⟩_z + i|↓⟩_z) and |↓⟩_y = (1/√2)(|↑⟩_z - i|↓⟩_z), we substitute back into |ψ(t)⟩. After simplification using Euler's formulas (cos(x) = (e^(ix)+e^(-ix))/2, sin(x) = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/2i), we get:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(ωt/2)|↓⟩_z.\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value.**\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩\n    With S_z|↑⟩_z = +(ħ/2)|↑⟩_z and S_z|↓⟩_z = -(ħ/2)|↓⟩_z, we find:\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (cos(ωt/2) * ⟨↑|_z - sin(ωt/2) * ⟨↓|_z) * S_z * (cos(ωt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(ωt/2)|↓⟩_z)\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = cos²(ωt/2) * (ħ/2) + sin²(ωt/2) * (-ħ/2)\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))\n    Using the trigonometric identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)\n\n5.  **Find the oscillation frequency.**\n    The z-component of the magnetic moment is ⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt).\n    Substituting ω = γB, we have:\n    ⟨μ_z⟩(t) = (γħ/2)cos((γB)t)\n\n    The function oscillates with an angular frequency equal to the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine, which is **γB**.\n\n#### Method 2: Heisenberg Picture (Classical Analogy)\n\nThe expectation value of the spin vector ⟨**S**⟩ obeys the classical torque equation:\nd⟨**S**⟩/dt = γ⟨**S**⟩ × **B'**\n\nIn our case, **B'** is along the y-axis, so **B'** = (0, B, 0).\nThe components of the equation are:\n*   d⟨S_x⟩/dt = γ(⟨S_y⟩B - ⟨S_z⟩*0) = -γB⟨S_z⟩ (using right-hand rule for cross product, not just magnitudes)\n*   d⟨S_y⟩/dt = γ(⟨S_z⟩*0 - ⟨S_x⟩*B) = 0\n*   d⟨S_z⟩/dt = γ(⟨S_x⟩*B - ⟨S_y⟩*0) = γB⟨S_x⟩\n\nThis describes the precession of the vector ⟨**S**⟩ around the Y-axis.

Its spin angular momentum is described by the spin operator $\\vec{S} = (S_x, S_y, S_z)$. The magnetic moment is given by $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{S}$, where $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field $\\vec{B}_{init} = B\\hat{z}$. The interaction Hamiltonian is $H_{init} = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_{init} = -\\gamma B S_z$.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the particle is in its lowest energy state. The eigenvalues of $S_z$ are $+\\hbar/2$ (for the spin-up state $|\\uparrow\\rangle_z$) and $-\\hbar/2$ (for the spin-down state $|\\downarrow\\rangle_z$).\n    *   The energies are $E = -\\gamma B (\\pm \\hbar/2)$. To minimize the energy (assuming $\\gamma$ and $B$ are positive, which is standard), we must maximize the eigenvalue of $S_z$. Thus, the particle is in the spin-up state along the z-axis.\n    *   So, the state of the system at time $t=0$ is $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |\\uparrow\\rangle_z$. The expectation value of the spin is purely in the z-direction: $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle_0 = \\langle\\uparrow|_z \\vec{S} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\hat{z}$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Dynamics after the Change:**\n    *   At $t=0$, the magnetic field is suddenly changed to $\\vec{B}_{new} = B\\hat{y}$.\n    *   For $t > 0$, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian, $H = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_{new} = -\\gamma B S_y$.\n    *   The time evolution of the state vector is given by the Schrödinger equation: $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-iHt/\\hbar} |\\psi(0)\\rangle$.\n    *   Substituting the new Hamiltonian and the initial state, we get:\n        $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-i(-\\gamma B S_y)t/\\hbar} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z = e^{i\\gamma B S_y t/\\hbar} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    *   We want to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$.\n    *   $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle\\psi(t)|S_z|\\psi(t)\\rangle$.\n    *   Let's calculate $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle$. There are a few ways to do this.\n\n    **Method 1: Larmor Precession (Semi-classical approach)**\n    *   The equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector is $\\frac{d\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle}{dt} = \\langle\\vec{\\mu}\\rangle \\times \\vec{B}_{new} = \\gamma \\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle \\times \\vec{B}_{new}$.\n    *   This equation describes the precession of the vector $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle$ around the magnetic field axis ($\\hat{y}$) with an angular frequency $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n    *   The initial spin vector is $\\langle\\vec{S}(0)\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\hat{z}$. This vector will precess in the x-z plane around the y-axis.\n    *   The z-component of the precessing vector is given by $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = |\\langle\\vec{S}(0)\\rangle| \\cos(\\omega_L t) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    *   The expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component is then $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    *   The expression for $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$ is a cosine function of time. The argument of the cosine is $\\omega t = \\gamma B t$.\n    *   Therefore, the angular oscillation frequency is $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n    **Method 2: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation**\n    *   We need to compute $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{i\\gamma B S_y t/\\hbar} |\\uparrow\\rangle_z$. Let $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$. The time evolution operator is $U(t) = e^{i\\omega_L t S_y/\\hbar}$.\n    *   The operator $e^{i\\theta S_y/\\hbar}$ represents a rotation about the y-axis by an angle $\\theta$. Here, $\\theta = \\omega_L t = \\gamma B t$.\n    *   We are rotating the initial state $|\\uparrow\\rangle_z$ around the y-axis. In terms of state vectors:\n        $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\uparrow\\rangle_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\downarrow\\rangle_z$.\n        (Note: The angle in the spinor rotation formula is half the angle of the vector rotation).\n    *   Now, we compute the expectation value:\n        $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\langle\\psi(t)| S_z |\\psi(t)\\rangle$\n        $= \\left( \\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle\\uparrow|_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle\\downarrow|_z \\right) S_z \\left( \\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\uparrow\\rangle_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\downarrow\\rangle_z \\right)$\n    *   Since $S_z|\\uparrow\\rangle_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}|\\uparrow\\rangle_z$ and $S_z|\\downarrow\\rangle_z = -\\frac{\\hbar}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle_z$, this becomes:\n        $= \\left( \\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle\\uparrow|_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle\\downarrow|_z \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\uparrow\\rangle_z + \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |\\downarrow\\rangle_z \\right)$\n    *   Using the orthogonality of the spin states ($\\langle\\uparrow|\\uparrow\\rangle = 1$, $\\langle\\downarrow|\\downarrow\\rangle=1$, $\\langle\\uparrow|\\downarrow\\rangle=0$), we get:\n        $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\cos^2(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) - \\sin^2(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\right)$\n    *   Using the double-angle identity $\\cos(2\\theta) = \\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta$:\n        $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\omega_L t) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    *   This gives the same result as the Larmor precession method. The average of the z-component of the moment is $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar}{2}\\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates as $\\cos(\\gamma B t)$.

Its state can be described by a two-component spinor.\n    Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_z` in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with it. The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_i = -μ · B = -μ_z * B = -γ * S_z * B`.\n    The energy levels are `E = -γ * m_s * ħ * B`, where `m_s = ±1/2` are the spin quantum numbers.\n    \"Aligned with the field\" means the particle is in the lowest energy state. Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` is positive, the lowest energy state corresponds to the largest possible value of `m_s`, which is `m_s = +1/2`. This is the spin-up state along the Z-axis.\n    So, the initial state vector at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z`. In the standard basis where `S_z` is diagonal, this is represented by the spinor `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n2.  **Identify the new Hamiltonian for t > 0.**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction. The new field is `B_y`. The magnitude `B` remains the same. The new Hamiltonian `H_f` that governs the time evolution for `t>0` is:\n    `H_f = -μ · B = -μ_y * B = -γ * S_y * B`.\n    The spin operator `S_y` for a spin-1/2 particle is given by `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    So, `H_f = -γ * B * (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the time evolution of the state.**\n    The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t) |ψ(0)⟩ = exp(-i * H_f * t / ħ) * |ψ(0)⟩`.\n    Let's evaluate the time evolution operator `U(t)`:\n    `U(t) = exp(-i * (-γ * B * S_y) * t / ħ) = exp(i * γ * B * t * S_y / ħ)`\n    `U(t) = exp(i * (γ * B * t / 2) * σ_y)`.\n    Let `θ = γ * B * t / 2`. The operator is `exp(i * θ * σ_y)`.\n    Using the property of Pauli matrices that `σ_y^2 = I` (the identity matrix), we can expand the exponential using its Taylor series, which simplifies to:\n    `exp(i * θ * σ_y) = I * cos(θ) + i * σ_y * sin(θ)`.\n    Substituting the matrices for `I` and `σ_y`:\n    `U(t) = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] * cos(γBt/2) + i * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * sin(γBt/2)`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`.\n    Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = [[1], [0]]`:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] * [[1], [0]] = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment.**\n    The z-component of the magnetic moment operator is `μ_z = γ * S_z`.\n    `S_z = (ħ/2) * σ_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    The expectation value `<μ_z>` at time `t` is given by `<ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    First, let's find `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    The bra vector `<ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ(t)⟩`, which is `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]`.\n    `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `= (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `= (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`.\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`, we get:\n    `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    Now, we find the expectation value of the magnetic moment:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the oscillation frequency.**\n    The expression for the average of the z-component of the moment is `<μ_z>(t) = A * cos(ωt)`, where the amplitude is `A = γħ/2` and the angular frequency is `ω = γB`.\n    This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and the frequency `ω = γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe calculated oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   **System:** A spin-1/2 particle. Its state can be described by a 2D complex vector (a spinor).\n*   **Magnetic Moment:** The magnetic moment `μ` is proportional to the spin `S`, given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The notation `mu (= gamma*Sz)` is a common shorthand, implying the relationship is vectorial, `μ = γS`. If we interpreted it literally, the problem would lead to a non-oscillating result, which contradicts the question's premise.\n*   **Initial Field and Hamiltonian:** The magnetic field is `B_initial = (0, 0, B)`. The Hamiltonian of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is `H = -μ · B`.\n    *   `H_initial = -γS · B_initial = -γB S_z`.\n*   **Initial State:** The particle's moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state. The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the eigenstates of `S_z`, which are spin-up `|+z>` and spin-down `|-z>`.\n    *   `S_z |+z> = +(ħ/2) |+z>` -> Energy `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   `S_z |-z> = -(ħ/2) |-z>` -> Energy `E_- = +γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   The lower energy state is `|+z>`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The Change in the System (t ≥ 0)\n\n*   **New Field and Hamiltonian:** The magnetic field is abruptly switched to the +Y direction. The new field is `B_new = (0, B, 0)`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t ≥ 0` is `H_new = -μ · B_new = -γS · (0, B, 0) = -γB S_y`.\n*   The system's state `|ψ(t)>` will now evolve according to this new Hamiltonian.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n\nThe time evolution of a quantum state is governed by the Schrödinger equation, which gives:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i H_new t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\nSubstituting the new Hamiltonian and the initial state:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t / ħ) |+z> = exp(iγB S_y t / ħ) |+z>`\n\nThis operator describes a rotation of the spin state around the Y-axis. The angle of rotation is `θ(t) = -γBt`. The precession of the spin has begun.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\n\nWe need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)>`. To find `<S_z(t)>`, we calculate `<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n\nThere are several ways to do this. A very direct method relies on the energy difference in the new system.\n\n**Method: Using Energy Eigenstates of the New Hamiltonian**\n\n1.  The new Hamiltonian is `H_new = -γB S_y`. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which we'll call `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    *   `S_y |+y> = +(ħ/2) |+y>` -> Energy `E_{+y} = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   `S_y |-y> = -(ħ/2) |-y>` -> Energy `E_{-y} = +γB(ħ/2)`\n\n2.  We express the initial state `|+z>` in terms of the new energy eigenstates:\n    *   `|+z> = (1/√2) |+y> + (1/√2) |-y>`\n\n3.  The state at time `t` is the time-evolved superposition:\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) exp(-iE_{+y} t/ħ) |+y> + (1/√2) exp(-iE_{-y} t/ħ) |-y>`\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) exp(iγBt/2) |+y> + (1/√2) exp(-iγBt/2) |-y>`\n\n4.  The expectation value of an observable `A` in such a superposition will oscillate at a frequency `ω` determined by the energy difference `ΔE = E_{-y} - E_{+y}`.\n    *   `ΔE = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n\n5.  The oscillation frequency is given by the Bohr frequency condition `ω = ΔE / ħ`.\n    *   `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\nThis angular frequency `ω` is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nLet's confirm this by completing the full calculation for `<S_z(t)>`:\nFirst, express `|ψ(t)>` back in the z-basis:\n`|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\nThen, calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`:\n`<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * S_z * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n`<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * ( (ħ/2)cos(γBt/2)|+z> + (ħ/2)sin(γBt/2)|-z> )`\nUsing the orthogonality of `|+z>` and `|-z>`, this simplifies to:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\nFinally, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThe time-dependent part is `cos(ωt)` where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State**:\n    The particle is spin-1/2 and its magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. This means the particle is in the spin-up eigenstate of the `Sz` operator. The Hamiltonian for this initial situation is `H_initial = -mu . B = - (gamma * Sz) * B`. Being \"aligned\" means the system is in the lower energy state, which for a spin-1/2 particle is the `spin-up` state along Z.\n    So, the initial state vector at `t=0` is `|psi(0)> = |+z>`, which is the eigenvector of `Sz` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**:\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution of the system is:\n    `H = -mu . B`\n    Here, `mu` is the magnetic moment vector operator, `mu = gamma * S`, where `S` is the spin vector operator `S = (Sx, Sy, Sz)`.\n    The new magnetic field is `B = B * y_hat` (where `y_hat` is the unit vector in the y-direction).\n    `H = - (gamma * S) . (B * y_hat) = -gamma * B * Sy`\n\n3.  **Time Evolution and Larmor Precession**:\n    The initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H = -gamma * B * Sy`. Therefore, the state will evolve in time according to the Schrödinger equation. This time evolution corresponds to the precession of the spin's expectation value `<S>` around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession.\n\n4.  **Equations of Motion (Heisenberg Picture)**:\n    A clear way to find the oscillation frequency is to look at the time evolution of the expectation values of the spin components using the Ehrenfest theorem, which leads to the classical equation of motion for the expectation values:\n    `d<S>/dt = (1/(iħ)) * <[S, H]>`\n    Substituting `H = -gamma * B * Sy`:\n    `d<Sz>/dt = (1/(iħ)) * <[Sz, -gamma*B*Sy]> = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * <[Sz, Sy]>`\n\n    Using the commutation relation for spin operators, `[Si, Sj] = iħ * ε_ijk * Sk`, we find:\n    `[Sz, Sy] = iħ * ε_zyx * Sx = iħ * (-1) * Sx = -iħ * Sx`\n\n    Substituting this back into the equation for `d<Sz>/dt`:\n    `d<Sz>/dt = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * (-iħ * <Sx>) = gamma * B * <Sx>` (Equation 1)\n\n    Similarly, we find the equation for `d<Sx>/dt`:\n    `d<Sx>/dt = (1/(iħ)) * <[Sx, -gamma*B*Sy]> = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * <[Sx, Sy]>`\n    The commutation relation is `[Sx, Sy] = iħ * Sz`.\n    `d<Sx>/dt = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * (iħ * <Sz>) = -gamma * B * <Sz>` (Equation 2)\n\n5.  **Solving for the Oscillation Frequency**:\n    We now have a pair of coupled first-order differential equations. To solve for `<Sz(t)>`, we can differentiate Equation 1 with respect to time:\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = gamma * B * d<Sx>/dt`\n\n    Now, substitute Equation 2 into this new equation:\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = gamma * B * (-gamma * B * <Sz>)`\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = -(gamma * B)² * <Sz>`\n\n    This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `x'' = -ω²x`. By comparing the two equations, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation `ω`.\n    `ω² = (gamma * B)²`\n    `ω = gamma * B`\n\n    The average of the z-component of the particle's moment is `<mu_z(t)> = gamma * <Sz(t)>`. Since `<Sz(t)>` oscillates with angular frequency `ω = gamma * B`, `<mu_z(t)>` will also oscillate with the same frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe calculated frequency matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle, meaning its spin quantum number is s = 1/2. The z-component of its spin can be either +ħ/2 (spin up) or -ħ/2 (spin down).\n    *   Its magnetic moment is `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator. The z-component of the magnetic moment is `μ_z = γS_z`.\n    *   The particle is initially \"aligned\" with a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. This means the system is in an energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian `H_initial = -μ · B = -μ_z B = -γB S_z`. The lowest energy state corresponds to the magnetic moment being aligned with the field. In this case, since `γ` is typically positive for particles like protons, a positive `μ_z` (spin up) would be a higher energy state. However, \"aligned\" usually implies the spin projection is along the field direction, so the particle is in the spin-up state along the z-axis.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state vector at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`, which is the eigenstate of `S_z` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`. In the standard basis where `|+z> = [1, 0]` and `|-z> = [0, 1]`, this is the vector `[1, 0]`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Dynamics (t ≥ 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction: `B_new = B * y_hat`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H = -μ · B_new = -μ_y B = -γB S_y`.\n    *   The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting the Hamiltonian: `U(t) = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)`.\n\n3.  **Perform the Quantum Mechanical Calculation:**\n    *   Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The time evolution operator becomes `U(t) = exp(iωtS_y/ħ)`.\n    *   We need the matrix representation of `S_y` in the `S_z` basis: `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   The operator becomes `U(t) = exp(iωt * (ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y)`.\n    *   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = I*cos(θ) + iσ_k*sin(θ)` for any Pauli matrix `σ_k`, with `θ = ωt/2` and `σ_k = σ_y`:\n        `U(t) = I*cos(ωt/2) + iσ_y*sin(ωt/2)`\n        `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + i*[[0, -i], [i, 0]]*sin(ωt/2)`\n        `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]*sin(ωt/2)`\n        `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]`\n    *   Now, we find the state `|ψ(t)>` by applying this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z> = [1, 0]`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|+z> = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] * [1, 0]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]` (as a column vector).\n        This can be written as `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`.\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ * <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   First, let's find the action of `S_z` on `|ψ(t)>`:\n        `S_z|ψ(t)> = S_z * (cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n        Since `S_z|+z> = +ħ/2|+z>` and `S_z|-z> = -ħ/2|-z>`,\n        `S_z|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)*(+ħ/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)*(-ħ/2)|-z>`\n        `S_z|ψ(t)> = (ħ/2) * (cos(ωt/2)|+z> + sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n    *   Now we compute the inner product `<ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`:\n        `<ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ(t)>`, which is `cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|`.\n        `<S_z>(t) = (cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|) * (ħ/2) * (cos(ωt/2)|+z> + sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n        Using the orthogonality of the basis states (`<+z|+z> = 1`, `<-z|-z> = 1`, `<+z|-z> = 0`), we get:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)]`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, with `θ = ωt/2`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n    *   The term `cos(ωt)` shows that the value oscillates in time. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\n    *   Recalling our definition from step 3, `ω = γB`.\n    *   Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n6.  **Alternative Viewpoint (Larmor Precession):**\n    *   This physical situation is a textbook example of Larmor precession.\n    *   A magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` experiences a torque `τ = μ x B`. This torque causes the angular momentum vector `S` to precess around the magnetic field vector `B`.\n    *   The equation of motion is `dS/dt = γS x B`. This describes a precession with an angular frequency `ω_L = γB`, known as the Larmor frequency.\n    *   In this problem, the initial spin is along the Z-axis, and the magnetic field is along the Y-axis. The spin vector will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane.\n    *   The projection of the precessing spin vector onto the Z-axis will vary as `cos(ω_L*t)`.\n    *   Thus, the z-component of the spin (and the magnetic moment) oscillates with the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`. This classical picture gives the same result as the full quantum mechanical calculation.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both the detailed quantum calculation and the physical intuition from Larmor precession show that the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `γB`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\nThe particle is spin 1/2 and is initially in a magnetic field `B_initial` pointing in the `+z` direction. Its magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with this field. The magnetic moment operator is given by `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin vector operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is `H = -μ · B`.\n\nInitially, `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -γS_z B`.\nThe energy levels are `E = -γB m_s ħ`, where `m_s` can be `+1/2` (for spin-up, `|+z⟩`) or `-1/2` (for spin-down, `|-z⟩`).\n\nThe term \"aligned with the magnetic field\" means the magnetic moment vector points in the same direction as the magnetic field. This is the lower energy state.\nThe z-component of the magnetic moment is `μ_z = γS_z`. For the expectation value to be in the `+z` direction, `<μ_z>` must be positive.\n*   If `γ > 0` (e.g., for a proton), `<μ_z> = γ<S_z>` is positive when `<S_z>` is positive. The state with the maximum positive `<S_z>` is `|+z⟩` (where `<S_z> = +ħ/2`). This state has energy `E = -γB(ħ/2)`, which is the lower energy state.\n*   If `γ < 0` (e.g., for an electron), `<μ_z> = γ<S_z>` is positive when `<S_z>` is negative. The state with the most negative `<S_z>` is `|-z⟩` (where `<S_z> = -ħ/2`). This state has energy `E = -γB(-ħ/2) = |γ|B(ħ/2)`. Wait, let me recheck the energy. `E = -γ<S_z>B`. For the state `|-z>`, `E = -γ(-ħ/2)B = γħB/2`. Since `γ` is negative, this energy is negative, making it the lower energy state.\n\nSo, in either case, the system starts in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian. Let's proceed assuming `γ > 0` and the initial state is `|+z⟩`. We will see that the final frequency doesn't depend on this choice.\nThe initial state at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`. In matrix form, `|+z⟩ = [[1], [0]]`.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian\nAt `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to be `B_new` in the `+y` direction with the same magnitude `B`.\nThe new Hamiltonian for `t>0` is `H = -μ · B_new = -γS_y B`.\nThe spin operator `S_y` is `(ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\nSo, `H = -γB(ħ/2)σ_y`.\nLet's define the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`.\nThe Hamiltonian becomes `H = -(ħω_L/2)σ_y`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\nThe state evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩`.\nSubstituting `H`:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i[-(ħω_L/2)σ_y]t/ħ) |+z⟩`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(i(ω_L t/2)σ_y) |+z⟩`\n\nTo evaluate the matrix exponential `exp(iθσ_y)`, we use the general formula `exp(iθ n · σ) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ) n · σ`, where `n` is a unit vector. Here `θ = ω_L t/2` and `n` is the y-direction vector `(0,1,0)`.\n`exp(i(ω_L t/2)σ_y) = cos(ω_L t/2)I + i sin(ω_L t/2)σ_y`\nwhere `I` is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\nNow, we apply this operator to the initial state `|+z⟩`:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(ω_L t/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(ω_L t/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]] [[1], [0]]`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ω_L t/2) [[1], [0]] + i sin(ω_L t/2) [[0], [i]]`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ω_L t/2) [[1], [0]] + i² sin(ω_L t/2) [[0], [1]]`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ω_L t/2) [[1], [0]] - sin(ω_L t/2) [[0], [1]]`\nIn ket notation, this is:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ω_L t/2)|+z⟩ - sin(ω_L t/2)|-z⟩`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>`.\nWe know `μ_z = γS_z`. So we need to calculate `<S_z>(t)`.\n`<S_z>(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`\nThe operator `S_z` is `(ħ/2)σ_z`, where `σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n`S_z|ψ(t)⟩ = S_z (cos(ω_L t/2)|+z⟩ - sin(ω_L t/2)|-z⟩)`\nSince `S_z|+z⟩ = +(ħ/2)|+z⟩` and `S_z|-z⟩ = -(ħ/2)|-z⟩`:\n`S_z|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ω_L t/2)(ħ/2)|+z⟩ - sin(ω_L t/2)(-ħ/2)|-z⟩`\n`S_z|ψ(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) [cos(ω_L t/2)|+z⟩ + sin(ω_L t/2)|-z⟩]`\n\nNow we compute the inner product `⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`:\n`⟨ψ(t)| = cos(ω_L t/2)⟨+z| - sin(ω_L t/2)⟨-z|`\n`<S_z>(t) = (cos(ω_L t/2)⟨+z| - sin(ω_L t/2)⟨-z|) * (ħ/2) [cos(ω_L t/2)|+z⟩ + sin(ω_L t/2)|-z⟩]`\nUsing the orthonormality of the basis kets (`⟨+z|+z⟩=1`, `⟨-z|-z⟩=1`, `⟨+z|-z⟩=0`):\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) [cos²(ω_L t/2) * 1 - sin²(ω_L t/2) * 1]`\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) [cos²(ω_L t/2) - sin²(ω_L t/2)]`\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) cos(ω_L t)`\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(ω_L t)`\nSubstituting `ω_L = γB`:\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThis is an oscillatory function `cos(ωt)`. The angular frequency of oscillation `ω` is the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine function.\n`ω = γB`\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` precesses around the new magnetic field (`y`-axis) at the Larmor frequency `ω_L = γB`. The projection of this precessing vector onto the `z`-axis oscillates with this frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2 and is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field in the +Z direction.\n*   The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `H = -μ ⋅ B`.\n*   The magnetic moment operator `μ` is proportional to the spin operator `S`, so `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   For a magnetic field `B_z` in the +Z direction, `H = -γS ⋅ (B_z ẑ) = -γB_z Sz`.\n*   The eigenstates of this Hamiltonian are the eigenstates of `Sz`: spin-up `|+z>` with energy `E_+ = -γB_z(ħ/2)` and spin-down `|-z>` with energy `E_- = +γB_z(ħ/2)`.\n*   \"Aligned\" means the particle is in the lowest energy state. Assuming `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is `E_+`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n*   So, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In matrix form, `|+z> = [[1], [0]]`.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian for Time Evolution\n\n*   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the +Y direction.\n*   The new Hamiltonian `H'` that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H' = -μ ⋅ (Bŷ) = -γS ⋅ (Bŷ) = -γB Sy`.\n*   The spin operator `Sy` is given by `Sy = (ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n*   So, `H' = -γB(ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Time Evolution of the State\n\nThe state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation's evolution operator:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-iH't/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n\nThis can be solved in two ways:\n\n**Method A: Using Eigenstates of the New Hamiltonian**\n\n1.  Find the eigenstates of `H'` (which are the eigenstates of `Sy`).\n    *   The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The corresponding normalized eigenvectors are:\n        *   `|+y>` (eigenvalue +ħ/2): `(1/√2) [[1], [i]] = (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>)`\n        *   `|-y>` (eigenvalue -ħ/2): `(1/√2) [[1], [-i]]` -> Let me recheck this from the thought process. My previous calculation gave `(1/√2)[i, 1]`. Let's stick to the rotation operator method which is less prone to error in eigenvector definitions.\n\n**Method B: Using the Rotation Operator (More Direct)**\n\nThe time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ)` can be seen as a rotation operator.\n`U(t) = exp(-i(-γB Sy)t/ħ) = exp(i(γBt)Sy/ħ)`\n\nThis operator represents a rotation around the Y-axis by an angle `θ = -γBt`.\nThe general rotation operator around the Y-axis is `R_y(θ) = exp(-iθSy/ħ) = cos(θ/2)I - i sin(θ/2)σ_y`.\nHere, our evolution operator `U(t)` corresponds to `R_y(-γBt)`.\n`U(t) = cos(-γBt/2)I - i sin(-γBt/2)σ_y = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ_y`\nIn matrix form:\n`U(t) = cos(γBt/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(γBt/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n`U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n\nNow, apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z> = [[1], [0]]`:\n`|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] [[1], [0]]`\n`|ψ(t)> = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\nIn terms of the Z-basis vectors, this is:\n`|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the moment, `<μz(t)>`.\n`<μz(t)> = <ψ(t)| μz |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γSz |ψ(t)> = γ<ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`\n\nFirst, calculate `<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`.\n`Sz = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n`<Sz(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<-z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * (Sz) * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n`Sz` acts on the kets: `Sz|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `Sz|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`.\n`Sz|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)(ħ/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)(-ħ/2)|-z> = (ħ/2)(cos(γBt/2)|+z> + sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n\nNow, take the inner product with `<ψ(t)|`:\n`<Sz(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * (ħ/2)(cos(γBt/2)|+z> + sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\nUsing the orthogonality of the basis vectors (`<+z|+z>=1`, `<+z|-z>=0`, etc.), we get:\n`<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`, we have:\n`<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe expression for `<μz(t)>` is a cosine function `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω` is:\n`ω = γB`\n\nThis is the famous Larmor frequency. The question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is `ω`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe calculated frequency `γB` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the initial state:**\n    The particle is spin-1/2 and is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the `Sz` operator. \"Aligned\" implies the spin projection is along the field, so it's in the \"spin-up\" state with respect to the Z-axis. We denote this state as `|+z>`. In the standard basis where the eigenvectors of `Sz` are `[[1], [0]]` for spin-up and `[[0], [1]]` for spin-down, we have:\n    `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z> = [[1], [0]]`\n\n2.  **Define the Hamiltonian for t > 0:**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with magnitude `B`. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `H = -μ ⋅ B`. The magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The spin operator `S` is given by `(ħ/2)σ`, where `σ` are the Pauli matrices.\n    The magnetic field is `B = (0, B, 0)`.\n    So, `S ⋅ B = Sx*0 + Sy*B + Sz*0 = B*Sy`.\n    The Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -γ(S ⋅ B) = -γB*Sy`.\n    The `Sy` operator is given by `Sy = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    So, `H = -γB(ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n3.  **Find the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian:**\n    The system will evolve according to this new Hamiltonian. The oscillation frequencies of expectation values are determined by the energy differences between the eigenstates of this Hamiltonian. The eigenstates of `H` are the same as the eigenstates of `Sy`.\n    Let's find the eigenvalues of `H`. The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    The corresponding energy eigenvalues are:\n    `E1 = -γB * (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n    `E2 = -γB * (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n    The energy difference between these two states is:\n    `ΔE = E2 - E1 = (γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n\n4.  **Determine the oscillation frequency:**\n    When a quantum system is in a superposition of energy eigenstates (which is the case here, as the initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of `Sy`), the expectation values of observables that don't commute with the Hamiltonian will oscillate. The angular frequency of this oscillation is given by the Bohr frequency rule: `ω = ΔE / ħ`.\n    `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n    This is the angular frequency of the Larmor precession of the spin around the new magnetic field direction (Y-axis).\n\n5.  **Confirm by calculating the expectation value:**\n    Let's explicitly calculate the expectation value of `μz` as a function of time.\n    First, we express the initial state `|+z>` in terms of the eigenstates of `Sy`, which we'll call `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    `|+y> = (1/√2) * [[1], [i]]` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2` for `Sy`)\n    `|-y> = (1/√2) * [[1], [-i]]` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2` for `Sy`)\n    We can write `|+z>` as a linear combination:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n\n    The time evolution of the state is given by `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)>`.\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * ( e^(-iE1*t/ħ)|+y> + e^(-iE2*t/ħ)|-y> )`\n    Substituting `E1 = -γBħ/2` and `E2 = +γBħ/2`, and letting `ω = γB`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * ( e^(-i(-ωħ/2)t/ħ)|+y> + e^(-i(ωħ/2)t/ħ)|-y> )`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * ( e^(iωt/2)|+y> + e^(-iωt/2)|-y> )`\n\n    Now, we want to calculate `<μz(t)> = γ<ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`.\n    We need to express `|ψ(t)>` back in the Z-basis.\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(iωt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + e^(-iωt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [ (e^(iωt/2) + e^(-iωt/2))|+z> + i(e^(iωt/2) - e^(-iωt/2))|-z> ]`\n    Using Euler's identities (`cos(x) = (e^(ix)+e^(-ix))/2`, `sin(x) = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/2i`):\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`\n\n    Now we calculate `<Sz(t)>`:\n    `<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`\n    `= [cos(ωt/2) <+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|] * Sz * [cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>]`\n    Since `Sz|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `Sz|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`,\n    `<Sz(t)> = [cos(ωt/2) <+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|] * [cos(ωt/2)(ħ/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)(-ħ/2)|-z>]`\n    `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`:\n    `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n    The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n    The value of `<μz(t)>` oscillates with a function `cos(ωt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\n    From our earlier definition, `ω = γB`.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle, meaning its spin can be either \"up\" or \"down\" along any chosen axis.\n*   Its magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin angular momentum operator.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction (`B_vec = B * z_hat`). The Hamiltonian for the system is `H_initial = -μ · B_vec = -γS · (B * z_hat) = -γB * Sz`.\n*   The particle's magnetic moment is stated to be \"aligned\" with this field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state. The eigenstates of `Sz` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   The lower energy state is `E_up`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n*   Therefore, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The Change in Hamiltonian (t ≥ 0)\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction (`B_vec = B * y_hat`).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0` is `H_new = -μ · B_vec = -γS · (B * y_hat) = -γB * Sy`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n\nThe state `|ψ(t)>` will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian. An efficient way to find the oscillation frequency is to consider the energy spectrum of the new Hamiltonian.\n\n*   The time evolution of any quantum state can be understood by decomposing it into the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. The eigenstates of `H_new` are the same as the eigenstates of the `Sy` operator, which we denote as `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n*   The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n*   The energy eigenvalues of `H_new` are:\n    *   `E_+y` (for eigenstate `|+y>`): `E_+y = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   `E_-y` (for eigenstate `|-y>`): `E_-y = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`\n*   The initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H_new`. It is a superposition of the new eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>`. The relationship is:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n*   So at `t=0`, the state is `|ψ(0)> = (1/√2)|+y> + (1/√2)|-y>`. It's a superposition of two different energy states.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Oscillation Frequency\n\n*   The time evolution of the state will involve terms oscillating with a frequency determined by the energy difference between the components of the superposition.\n*   According to Bohr's frequency condition, the angular frequency `ω` of the oscillation between two energy states `E1` and `E2` is given by `ω = (E1 - E2) / ħ`.\n*   In our case, the energy difference between the two components of the state is `ΔE = E_-y - E_+y`.\n*   `ΔE = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n*   The oscillation frequency `ω` is therefore:\n    `ω = ΔE / ħ = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\nThis frequency `ω = γB` is known as the Larmor frequency. It is the frequency at which the expectation value of the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field. Since the z-component of the spin is perpendicular to the new field (along Y), its expectation value will oscillate with this Larmor frequency.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe average (expectation value) of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) `γB`\nB) `γB/√2`\nC) `√2 * γB`\nD) `γB/2`\n\nThe calculated frequency matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State of the System:**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, so its spin is described by the spin operators `S_x`, `S_y`, `S_z`.\n    *   The magnetic moment is `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, the magnetic field is `B_initial = B * z_hat` (in the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian for the initial state is `H_initial = -μ . B_initial = -γS . (B * z_hat) = -γB * S_z`.\n    *   The problem states the particle is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state (ground state). The energy is `E = -μ_z * B`. To minimize energy, the z-component of the magnetic moment, `μ_z`, must be positive and aligned with `B`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this means the expectation value of `S_z` must be positive. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`. The state with the lowest energy is the one with the highest `S_z` eigenvalue, which is the spin-up state along the z-axis.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is the eigenstate of `S_z` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`, denoted as `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the field is switched to `B_new = B * y_hat` (in the +Y direction).\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ . B_new = -γS . (B * y_hat) = -γB * S_y`.\n    *   The state of the system will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation with this new Hamiltonian. Any observable `A` that does not commute with this new Hamiltonian will have an expectation value `<A(t)>` that can change over time.\n\n3.  **Oscillation Frequency and Energy Eigenstates:**\n    *   The time evolution of the system is governed by the superposition of the energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H`. The oscillation frequency of any observable is determined by the difference in energy between the eigenstates that are populated in the system.\n    *   The eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H = -γB * S_y` are the same as the eigenstates of the `S_y` operator. Let's call them `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    *   The eigenvalues of the `S_y` operator are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues `E` of the Hamiltonian `H` are:\n        *   For the eigenstate `|+y>` (where `S_y` has eigenvalue `+ħ/2`): `E_+ = -γB * (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`.\n        *   For the eigenstate `|-y>` (where `S_y` has eigenvalue `-ħ/2`): `E_- = -γB * (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`.\n    *   The initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H`. It can be written as a superposition of the new energy eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>`. Specifically, `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`. This means both energy levels, `E_+` and `E_-`, are populated.\n    *   The frequency of oscillation of the expectation value of an operator like `S_z` is given by the Bohr frequency, which is related to the energy difference (`ΔE`) between the populated states:\n        `Ω = ΔE / ħ`\n    *   The energy difference is `ΔE = E_- - E_+ = (γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n    *   The oscillation (angular) frequency is therefore:\n        `Ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`, will oscillate with an angular frequency `Ω = γB`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, where the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) with the Larmor frequency `Ω = γB`.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThis is a classic problem in quantum mechanics involving spin dynamics, specifically Larmor precession. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Initial State (`t < 0`)\n*   A spin-1/2 particle has a magnetic moment `vec(μ) = γ * vec(S)`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `vec(S)` is the spin angular momentum operator.\n*   The particle is in a uniform magnetic field `vec(B) = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -vec(μ) ⋅ vec(B) = - (γ * vec(S)) ⋅ (B * z_hat) = -γ * B * S_z`.\n*   The statement \"the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the magnetic field\" means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the eigenstates of `S_z`, which are spin-up `|+z>` and spin-down `|-z>`.\n    *   `S_z |+z> = +(ħ/2) |+z>`, giving energy `E_up = -γ * B * (ħ/2)`.\n    *   `S_z |-z> = -(ħ/2) |-z>`, giving energy `E_down = -γ * B * (-ħ/2) = +γ * B * (ħ/2)`.\n*   Assuming `γ` is positive (as is typical for protons), the lower energy state is `E_up`, corresponding to the spin-up state `|+z>`. So, the initial state of the system at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. Dynamics for `t > 0`\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to `vec(B) = B * y_hat` (pointing in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H_new = -vec(μ) ⋅ vec(B) = - (γ * vec(S)) ⋅ (B * y_hat) = -γ * B * S_y`.\n*   The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, the solution of which is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γ * B * S_y) * t / ħ) |+z>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γ * B * S_y * t / ħ) |+z>`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Expectation Value\nWe want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = γ * <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n\nThere are two common ways to solve this: the Schrödinger picture (evolving the state) or the Heisenberg picture (evolving the operator). The Heisenberg picture is often more direct for this type of problem.\n\n**Using the Heisenberg Picture:**\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the operators evolve in time, and the state vector remains fixed at `|ψ(0)>`. The equation of motion for an operator `A` is:\n`d(A)/dt = (1/iħ) * [A, H] + ∂A/∂t`\n\nLet's find the equations of motion for the spin operators. Let `ω = γB`. This is the Larmor frequency. The Hamiltonian is `H = -ω * S_y`.\n\n*   **For `S_z`:**\n    `dS_z/dt = (1/iħ) * [S_z, H] = (1/iħ) * [S_z, -ω * S_y] = (-ω/iħ) * [S_z, S_y]`\n    Using the commutation relation `[S_y, S_z] = iħ * S_x`, we get `[S_z, S_y] = -iħ * S_x`.\n    `dS_z/dt = (-ω/iħ) * (-iħ * S_x) = ω * S_x`\n\n*   **For `S_x`:**\n    `dS_x/dt = (1/iħ) * [S_x, H] = (1/iħ) * [S_x, -ω * S_y] = (-ω/iħ) * [S_x, S_y]`\n    Using the commutation relation `[S_x, S_y] = iħ * S_z`.\n    `dS_x/dt = (-ω/iħ) * (iħ * S_z) = -ω * S_z`\n\nNow we have a system of coupled differential equations for the operators:\n1.  `dS_z/dt = ω * S_x`\n2.  `dS_x/dt = -ω * S_z`\n\nTo solve for `S_z(t)`, we can differentiate the first equation and substitute the second:\n`d²S_z/dt² = ω * (dS_x/dt) = ω * (-ω * S_z) = -ω² * S_z`\n`d²S_z/dt² + ω² * S_z = 0`\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The general solution is:\n`S_z(t) = A * cos(ωt) + C * sin(ωt)`\nThe constants `A` and `C` are determined by the initial conditions at `t=0`. Since the operators in the Heisenberg picture at `t=0` are just the Schrödinger picture operators, we have:\n`A = S_z(0) = S_z`\n`C * ω = (dS_z/dt)|_(t=0) = ω * S_x(0) = ω * S_x`. So, `C = S_x`.\nThe full solution for the operator is `S_z(t) = S_z * cos(ωt) + S_x * sin(ωt)`.\n\nNow, we find the expectation value by \"sandwiching\" this operator between the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n`<S_z>(t) = <+z| S_z(t) |+z> = <+z| (S_z * cos(ωt) + S_x * sin(ωt)) |+z>`\n`<S_z>(t) = cos(ωt) * <+z| S_z |+z> + sin(ωt) * <+z| S_x |+z>`\n\nWe need to evaluate the matrix elements:\n*   `<+z| S_z |+z> = ħ/2` (by definition of the `|+z>` state).\n*   `S_x |+z> = (ħ/2)|-z>`. Therefore, `<+z| S_x |+z> = (ħ/2) * <+z|-z> = 0` (because `|+z>` and `|-z>` are orthogonal).\n\nSubstituting these values back:\n`<S_z>(t) = cos(ωt) * (ħ/2) + sin(ωt) * 0 = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe expectation value of the z-component of spin is `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`.\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\nSubstituting `ω = γB`:\n`<μ_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos( (γB) * t)`\n\nThis expression describes an oscillation. The term inside the cosine function is `(γB) * t`, which is of the form `(angular frequency) * t`.\nThus, the angular oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\nThe options provided are:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe calculated oscillation frequency matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:**\n    *   The particle is spin 1/2 with magnetic moment `μ = γS`.\n    *   Initially, there's a magnetic field `B` in the `+z` direction.

We need to find the oscillation frequency of this quantity.\n    *   There are a few ways to calculate this. A physically intuitive way is to use the concept of Larmor precession. In the Heisenberg picture, the equation of motion for the spin operator `S` is `dS/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S]`. For `H = -γB S_y`, this leads to `dS/dt = γ(S x B')`. This equation describes the precession of the spin vector `S` around the new magnetic field `B'` (which is along the y-axis) with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n4.  **Visualize the precession:**\n    *   Initially, the spin is pointing along the `+z` direction (`S(0)` is aligned with `z_hat`).\n    *   The magnetic field is now along the `+y` direction.\n    *   The spin vector `S` will precess around the y-axis in the x-z plane.\n    *   The z-component of the spin vector at time `t`, `S_z(t)`, will be the projection of the precessing vector onto the z-axis.\n    *   If the vector `S(0)` of magnitude `S` is initially on the z-axis and precesses around the y-axis with angular frequency `ω`, its projection on the z-axis at time `t` is `S_z(t) = S * cos(ωt)`.\n    *   Therefore, the expectation value `<S_z(t)>` will oscillate as `<S_z(0)> * cos(ωt)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the oscillation frequency:**\n    *   The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`.\n    *   So, the expectation value `<S_z(t)>` oscillates as `cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The full expression is `<S_z(t)> = <↑z|S_z|↑z> * cos(γBt) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The expectation value of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The oscillation is described by the term `cos(γBt)`.

Identify the Initial State\nThe problem states that a spin-1/2 particle is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n\n*   The magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator.\n*   The initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S_x, S_y, S_z) ⋅ (0, 0, B) = -γB S_z`.\n*   The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   For the magnetic moment to be \"aligned\" with the field (i.e., point in the `+Z` direction), the system must be in the state with the lowest energy. The expectation value of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩`. For `⟨μ_z⟩` to be positive (aligned with `+Z`), we need `γ⟨S_z⟩ > 0`.\n    *   If `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is `|+z⟩` (`E_up` is lower). In this state `⟨S_z⟩ = +ħ/2`, so `⟨μ_z⟩ > 0`.\n    *   If `γ < 0`, the lowest energy state is `|-z⟩` (`E_down` is lower). In this state `⟨S_z⟩ = -ħ/2`, so `⟨μ_z⟩ > 0`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state is an eigenstate of `S_z`. Let's assume the initial state is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`. We will see that the final frequency is independent of this choice.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\nAt `t=0`, the magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched to the `+Y` direction. The \"sudden approximation\" means the state of the particle does not have time to change. So, at `t=0+`, the state is still `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S_x, S_y, S_z) ⋅ (0, B, 0) = -γB S_y`.\n*   The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n*   `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ)|+z⟩ = exp(iγBt S_y / ħ)|+z⟩`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\nWe need to find the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`.\n\n*   `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n*   Substituting `|ψ(t)⟩`, we get:\n    `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ ⟨+z| exp(-iγBt S_y / ħ) S_z exp(iγBt S_y / ħ) |+z⟩`.\n\nThis is a classic example of Larmor precession. The evolution of the expectation value `⟨S⟩` follows the classical equation of motion for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field: `d⟨S⟩/dt = γ⟨S⟩ × B`. This describes the precession of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` around the magnetic field `B` with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n\nLet's calculate this quantum mechanically. The expression `exp(-iθn⋅S/ħ) S_k exp(iθn⋅S/ħ)` represents a rotation of the operator `S_k` around the axis `n` by an angle `θ`.\n\n*   Here, the rotation axis `n` is the Y-axis.\n*   The rotation angle is `θ = γBt`.\n*   The operator `S_z` is rotated around the Y-axis. The rotated operator `S_z(t)` is:\n    `S_z(t) = S_z cos(θ) - S_x sin(θ)`.\n    `S_z(t) = S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt)`.\n\nNow, we compute the expectation value in the initial state `|+z⟩`:\n\n*   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| S_z(t) |+z⟩ = ⟨+z| S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt) |+z⟩`.\n*   This splits into two terms: `cos(γBt)⟨+z| S_z |+z⟩ - sin(γBt)⟨+z| S_x |+z⟩`.\n\nWe need the expectation values of `S_z` and `S_x` in the state `|+z⟩`:\n\n*   `⟨+z| S_z |+z⟩ = ħ/2` (since `|+z⟩` is an eigenstate of `S_z`).\n*   `⟨+z| S_x |+z⟩ = 0` (The expectation value of `S_x` in an eigenstate of `S_z` is zero).\n\nPlugging these values back:\n\n*   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt) - 0 = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\nFinally, we find the expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component:\n\n*   `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\n### 4. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe expression for `⟨μ_z(t)⟩` shows that it oscillates sinusoidally with time. The general form of an oscillation is `cos(ωt)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n\n*   By comparing `cos(γBt)` with `cos(ωt)`, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation as `ω = γB`.\n\nThis frequency is the Larmor frequency. If we had chosen the initial state to be `|-z⟩`, the result would have been `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = -γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`, which has the same oscillation frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nAn analytical step-by-step derivation is provided to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Initial State (t=0):**\n    The problem states that a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment, **μ** = γ**S**, is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction, **B** = B **k̂**. The Hamiltonian for this situation is H = -**μ** · **B** = -γB S_z. Alignment with the field means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate.\n    *   The operator S_z has two eigenstates: spin-up |+z⟩ (eigenvalue +ħ/2) and spin-down |-z⟩ (eigenvalue -ħ/2).\n    *   The corresponding energies are E_up = -γB(ħ/2) and E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2).\n    *   Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio γ is positive (as is common for the intrinsic spin of particles like the electron, though γ_e is negative, the \"γ\" in these problems is often treated as a positive constant), the lowest energy state is the spin-up state, E_up.\n    *   Thus, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is the spin-up state along the Z-axis: |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩. In the standard S_z basis, this state is represented by the column vector `[1, 0]ᵀ`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian (t>0):**\n    Suddenly, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, **B'** = B **ĵ**. The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for t>0 is H' = -**μ** · **B'** = -γB S_y.\n    *   In the S_z basis, the spin operators are represented by the Pauli matrices (multiplied by ħ/2):\n        S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y = (ħ/2) * `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    *   So, the new Hamiltonian is H' = -γB(ħ/2) * `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:**\n    The state of the system evolves according to |ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩, where U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ) is the time evolution operator.\n    *   U(t) = exp[-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ] = exp[iγBt S_y/ħ]\n    *   Substituting S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, we get: U(t) = exp[iγBt(ħ/2)σ_y/ħ] = exp[i(γBt/2)σ_y].\n    *   Using the mathematical identity for Pauli matrices, exp(iθσ_k) = I*cos(θ) + iσ_k*sin(θ), where I is the identity matrix and θ = γBt/2.\n    *   U(t) = I*cos(γBt/2) + iσ_y*sin(γBt/2) = `[[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   Now, we apply this operator to the initial state:\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = `[[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]` * `[1, 0]ᵀ` = `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]ᵀ`\n    *   In bracket notation, the state at time t is: |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩.\n\n4.  **Expectation Value of μ_z:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨γS_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩.\n    *   The expectation value is calculated as ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩.\n    *   The operator S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2) * `[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    *   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]` * (ħ/2)`[[1, 0], [0, -1]]` * `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]ᵀ`\n    *   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]` * `[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)]ᵀ`\n    *   ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]\n    *   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n        ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt).\n    *   Therefore, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt).\n\n5.  **Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The expression ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt) describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is A*cos(ωt + φ), where ω is the angular frequency.\n    *   By comparing our result with the general form, we can see that the angular frequency of the oscillation is ω = γB.\n    This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and ω = γB is the Larmor frequency. The question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is this angular frequency.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe calculated frequency is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State (`t < 0`):**\n    *   A magnetic field `B` is in the +Z direction.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with this field. The potential energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is `U = -μ · B`. To be aligned, the moment must be in the lowest energy state.\n    *   The magnetic moment operator is `μ_vec = γ * S_vec`, where `S_vec` is the spin angular momentum operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B = - (γ * S_z) * B`.\n    *   The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the eigenstates of the spin-z operator `S_z`, which are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is `E_up`, corresponding to the spin-up state `|+z>`. So, the initial state of the particle is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`. (Note: even if we assume `γ < 0`, the resulting oscillation frequency remains the same, as shown in the detailed calculation below).\n\n2.  **Sudden Change (`t = 0`):**\n    *   The magnetic field in the Z direction is switched off.\n    *   A new magnetic field of the same magnitude `B` is switched on in the +Y direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution (`t > 0`):**\n    *   The system now evolves under a new Hamiltonian, `H_new`.\n    *   `H_new = -μ · B_new = - (γ * S_vec) · (B * ŷ) = -γB * S_y`.\n    *   The time evolution of the state vector `|ψ(t)>` is governed by the Schrödinger equation, whose solution is `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting `H_new`, we get: `U(t) = exp(-i * (-γB * S_y) * t / ħ) = exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ)`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Expectation Value `<μz>(t)`:**\n    *   We want to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is equivalent to finding `<S_z>(t)` and multiplying by `γ`. So, we need to calculate `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   This is a classic problem of Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector `<S_vec>` will precess around the direction of the new magnetic field (the Y-axis) with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n\n5.  **Larmor Frequency:**\n    *   The Larmor frequency is given by the formula `ω_L = |γB|`.\n    *   As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis (and also the X-axis) will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor frequency.\n    *   Therefore, the oscillation frequency of `<S_z>(t)`, and consequently `<μ_z>(t)`, is `ω = |γB|`. Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive constants as is typical in such problems, the frequency is `γB`.\n\n6.  **Formal Quantum Mechanical Calculation (Optional but confirms the result):**\n    We can solve this formally using the matrix representation of spin operators (Pauli matrices).\n    *   `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    *   `S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    *   Initial state `|+z>` is the vector `[[1], [0]]`.\n    *   The time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ) = exp(i * (γBt/2) * σ_y)`.\n    *   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_n) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)σ_n`, with `θ = γBt/2`:\n        `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ_y = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   The state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|+z> = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   Now we compute `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    *   Finally, the average z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This expression clearly shows an oscillation described by `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both the conceptual understanding of Larmor precession and the detailed quantum mechanical calculation give the same result. The oscillation frequency is `γB`. This corresponds to the Larmor frequency.

Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2, and the magnetic field `B` is in the `+Z` direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_i = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_z B`.\n*   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned with the field\". This means the particle is in the energy eigenstate corresponding to spin-up along Z.\n*   The initial state of the system at `t=0` is the spin-up eigenstate of `S_z`, denoted as `|+z⟩`. In the standard basis where `S_z` is diagonal, this is represented by the column vector `[1, 0]`.\n    `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩ = [1, 0]`\n\n### 2. Dynamics for t > 0\n\n*   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is applied in the `+Y` direction.\n*   The change is \"sudden,\" which means the state vector `|ψ⟩` does not have time to change. Thus, the state at `t=0+` is still `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n*   For `t > 0`, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian: `H_f = -μ ⋅ B_new = -γ(S ⋅ Bŷ) = -γB S_y`.\n*   Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The Hamiltonian simplifies to `H_f = -ω S_y`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n\nThe state at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩ = exp(-iH_f t / ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`\nSubstituting `H_f`:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-ωS_y)t / ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(iωtS_y / ħ) |+z⟩`\n\nTo evaluate the exponential of the `S_y` operator, we use its matrix form `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n`exp(iωtS_y / ħ) = exp(iωt(ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y)`\n\nUsing the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)σ_k`:\n`exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y) = cos(ωt/2)I + i sin(ωt/2)σ_y`\n`= cos(ωt/2)[[1,0],[0,1]] + i sin(ωt/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]]`\n`= [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]`\n\nNow, we apply this evolution operator to our initial state:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] [1, 0]`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value\n\nWe want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, we calculate `⟨S_z(t)⟩`:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`\nUsing the matrix for `S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`:\n\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0],[0, -1]] * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]`\n`= (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * [cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)]`\n`= (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))`\n\nUsing the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n`⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n\nThe expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component is:\n`⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n\n### 5. Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe expression for the average z-component of the moment is `γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`. This value oscillates in time according to the function `cos(ωt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\nWe defined the Larmor frequency as `ω = γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nThis physical phenomenon is called Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, `⟨S⟩`, which initially points along the Z-axis, begins to precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis oscillates with this same frequency.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial State\n*   The system consists of a spin-1/2 particle. The magnetic moment is given by the operator `vec(mu) = gamma * vec(S)`, where `vec(S)` is the spin operator and `gamma` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, the particle is in a magnetic field `B` along the +Z direction and is \"aligned with\" it. This means the particle is in its lowest energy state.\n*   The Hamiltonian for this initial setup is `H_initial = -vec(mu) . vec(B) = - (gamma * vec(S)) . (0, 0, B) = -gamma * B * Sz`.\n*   The eigenvalues of `Sz` for a spin-1/2 particle are `+hbar/2` (spin-up, `|+z>`) and `-hbar/2` (spin-down, `|-z>`).\n*   The corresponding energies are `E = -gamma * B * (eigenvalue of Sz)`.\n*   So, `E_up = -gamma*B*hbar/2` and `E_down = gamma*B*hbar/2`.\n*   The lowest energy state (assuming `gamma*B > 0`) is the spin-up state `|+z>`. So, the state of the system at time `t=0` is `|psi(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. Identify the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new field is `vec(B') = (0, B, 0)`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t >= 0` is `H = -vec(mu) . vec(B') = - (gamma * vec(S)) . (0, B, 0) = -gamma * B * Sy`.\n*   The state of the particle will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation, governed by this new Hamiltonian `H`.\n\n### 3. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe oscillation frequency of an expectation value in a quantum system is determined by the energy differences between the populated energy eigenstates.\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Find the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian `H`.**\n    The Hamiltonian is proportional to the spin operator `Sy`. So, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `Sy`, which we can call `|+y>` and `|-y>`. The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+hbar/2` and `-hbar/2`.\n    The energy eigenvalues are:\n    *   `E_+` (corresponding to `|+y>` state): `E_+ = -gamma * B * (+hbar/2) = - (gamma * B * hbar) / 2`\n    *   `E_-` (corresponding to `|-y>` state): `E_- = -gamma * B * (-hbar/2) = + (gamma * B * hbar) / 2`\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Express the initial state in the basis of the new energy eigenstates.**\n    The initial state is `|psi(0)> = |+z>`. We need to express this in the `Sy` eigenbasis. The `Sy` eigenstates are related to the `Sz` eigenstates as follows:\n    *   `|+y> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|+z> + i*|-z>)`\n    *   `|-y> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|+z> - i*|-z>)`\n    By adding these two equations, we get `|+y> + |-y> = sqrt(2) * |+z>`, which means:\n    `|+z> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    This shows that the initial state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Relate the energy difference to the oscillation frequency.**\n    When a system is in a superposition of two energy states with energies `E_a` and `E_b`, any observable that connects these two states will have an expectation value that oscillates with an angular frequency `omega` given by:\n    `omega = |E_a - E_b| / hbar`\n    In our case, the two populated states have energies `E_+` and `E_-`. The energy difference is:\n    `Delta E = E_- - E_+ = [(gamma * B * hbar) / 2] - [- (gamma * B * hbar) / 2] = gamma * B * hbar`\n    The oscillation frequency `omega` is therefore:\n    `omega = Delta E / hbar = (gamma * B * hbar) / hbar = gamma * B`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment, `<mu_z>(t) = gamma * <Sz>(t)`, will oscillate. This oscillation arises from the coherent superposition of the two energy eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>`. The frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, determined by the energy splitting caused by the new magnetic field.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `omega = gamma * B`.\n\nThis corresponds to the classical picture of Larmor precession, where the spin vector precesses about the magnetic field axis (`Y`-axis in this case) with an angular frequency of `gamma * B`. The `z`-component of the spin (and thus the magnetic moment) will oscillate as the cosine of this precessing angle.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   A spin-1/2 particle has a magnetic moment `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   The magnetic field is `B_initial = B * ẑ` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian for this initial system is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B_initial = - (γS) ⋅ (B ẑ) = -γB * Sz`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate. The energy `E = -γB * m_s * ħ`, where `m_s` is the spin quantum number. To minimize energy, we need `m_s` to be as large and positive as possible (assuming `γ` is positive, which is typical for electron spin, `γ_e < 0`, but for nuclei it can be positive. However, the dynamics don't depend on the sign of `γ`). The `Sz` eigenstates are `|+z>` (spin up, eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and `|-z>` (spin down, eigenvalue `-ħ/2`). The \"aligned\" or low-energy state is `|+z>`.\n    *   So, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the System for t ≥ 0:**\n    *   The magnetic field is suddenly changed to `B_final = B * ŷ` (pointing in the +Y direction). The term \"suddenly\" implies that the state of the particle does not have time to change at the instant of the switch.

The Hamiltonian for this initial situation is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_z B`. Since the moment is aligned with the field, the particle is in the lowest energy state, which is an eigenstate of the `S_z` operator. For a spin-1/2 particle, this is the \"spin-up\" state with respect to the Z-axis. We denote this state as `|+z>`. So, the state of the system at time t=0 is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`. In the standard basis where `S_z` is diagonal, this state is represented by the vector `[1, 0]^T`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:**\n    At t=0, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S_x B_x + S_y B_y + S_z B_z)`. Since the new field is `B` in the +Y direction, this becomes `H = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:**\n    The state of the particle will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation governed by the new Hamiltonian `H`. The solution is given by:\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)>`\n    Substituting the expression for `H`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ)|+z> = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)|+z>`\n    Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The equation becomes:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(iωtS_y/ħ)|+z>`\n    For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator `S_y` can be written in terms of the Pauli Y-matrix `σ_y`: `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`.\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(iωt(ħ/2)σ_y/ħ)|+z> = exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y)|+z>`\n\n    We can expand the exponential operator using the property `(σ_y)^2 = I` (where I is the identity matrix):\n    `exp(iθσ_y) = I cos(θ) + iσ_y sin(θ)`\n    Here, `θ = ωt/2`. The matrix for `σ_y` in the `S_z` basis is `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    So the time evolution operator `U(t)` is:\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + i sin(ωt/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]`\n\n    Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|+z> = [1, 0]^T`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] [1, 0]^T = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]^T`\n    In bra-ket notation: `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of `μ_z`, which is `<μ_z(t)>`.\n    `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|μ_z|ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)|γS_z|ψ(t)> = γ<S_z(t)>`\n    Let's calculate `<S_z(t)>`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`\n    We know that `S_z|+z> = +(ħ/2)|+z>` and `S_z|-z> = -(ħ/2)|-z>`.\n    `S_z|ψ(t)> = S_z(cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n    `= cos(ωt/2)(ħ/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)(-ħ/2)|-z>`\n    `= (ħ/2)[cos(ωt/2)|+z> + sin(ωt/2)|-z>]`\n    Now we take the inner product with `<ψ(t)| = cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2)(cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|)(cos(ωt/2)|+z> + sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n    Using the orthogonality of the states (`<+z|+z>=1`, `<+z|-z>=0`, etc.), we get:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2)[cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)]`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n    Substituting back `ω = γB`:\n    `<μ_z(t)> = (γħ/2)cos((γB)t)`\n    This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The term inside the cosine function is `(Angular Frequency) * time`. Therefore, the angular frequency of oscillation is `Ω = γB`.\n\nThe options provided are in the format of angular frequency.\n\n**Alternative approach (Classical/Semi-classical picture):**\nThe magnetic field `B` exerts a torque `τ` on the magnetic moment `μ`: `τ = μ x B`.\nThe torque causes a change in the angular momentum `S`: `dS/dt = τ`.\nCombining these, we get the equation of motion for the spin vector: `dS/dt = γS x B`.\nThis equation describes the precession of the spin vector `S` around the magnetic field vector `B`. The frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`.\nInitially, the spin is along the +Z axis. The new field is along the +Y axis. The spin vector will start precessing in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis. The Z-component of the spin vector, `<S_z>`, will oscillate between `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2` with the Larmor frequency.

This means the particle is in an energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian `H_i = -μ ⋅ B_i = -γBS_z`.\n    *   Being \"aligned\" means it's in the lowest energy state, which for a positive `γ` is the spin-up state with respect to the Z-axis. This state is denoted as `|+Z⟩` or `[[1], [0]]` in the `S_z` basis.\n    *   So, the state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+Z⟩`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Dynamics for t > 0**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to `B_f = B ŷ` (in the +Y direction).\n    *   The new Hamiltonian governing the time evolution of the system is `H = -μ ⋅ B_f = -γB S_y`.\n    *   The state `|ψ(0)⟩` is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H` and will evolve in time according to the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal**\n    *   We need to find the oscillation frequency of the *average* (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`.\n    *   `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n    *   This means we need to calculate how `⟨S_z(t)⟩` evolves in time.\n\n4.  **Method 1: Using Energy Eigenstates (Schrödinger Picture)**\n    *   The most straightforward way is to find the energy splitting caused by the new Hamiltonian. The oscillation frequency of the system between two states is given by `ω = ΔE/ħ`, where `ΔE` is the energy difference between the eigenstates.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian is `H = -γB S_y`. The operator `S_y` for a spin-1/2 particle has eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues of `H` are therefore:\n        *   `E_+ = -γB (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n        *   `E_- = -γB (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n    *   The energy difference (the energy gap) between these two levels is:\n        *   `ΔE = E_- - E_+ = (γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n    *   The oscillation frequency `ω` is given by the relation `ω = ΔE/ħ`.\n        *   `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n    *   This frequency `ω` is the Larmor frequency. Any observable whose operator is not diagonal in the energy eigenbasis will oscillate at this frequency. `S_z` is not diagonal in the eigenbasis of `S_y`, so `⟨S_z(t)⟩` will oscillate with frequency `γB`.\n\n5.  **Method 2: Full State Vector Evolution (Schrödinger Picture)**\n    *   Let's explicitly calculate the state `|ψ(t)⟩` and then `⟨S_z(t)⟩`.\n    *   The operator `S_y` is given by the Pauli matrix `σ_y`: `S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y = (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   The time evolution operator is `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ) = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) = exp(iγBS_y t/ħ)`.\n    *   We can write this as `U(t) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`.\n    *   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = I cos(θ) + iσ_k sin(θ)`, with `k=y` and `θ = γBt/2`:\n        *   `U(t) = I cos(γBt/2) + iσ_y sin(γBt/2)`\n        *   `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`. This represents a rotation about the Y-axis.\n    *   The initial state is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+Z⟩ = [[1], [0]]`.\n    *   The state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t) |ψ(0)⟩`:\n        *   `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] [[1], [0]] = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n        *   In bra-ket notation: `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2) |+Z⟩ - sin(γBt/2) |-Z⟩`.\n    *   Now we compute the expectation value `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`:\n        *   `S_z |ψ(t)⟩ = S_z (cos(γBt/2)|+Z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-Z⟩) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt/2)|+Z⟩ - (-ħ/2)sin(γBt/2)|-Z⟩ = (ħ/2)(cos(γBt/2)|+Z⟩ + sin(γBt/2)|-Z⟩)`.\n        *   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (cos(γBt/2)⟨+Z| - sin(γBt/2)⟨-Z|) * (ħ/2)(cos(γBt/2)|+Z⟩ + sin(γBt/2)|-Z⟩)`.\n        *   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) [cos^2(γBt/2) - sin^2(γBt/2)]`.\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos^2(θ) - sin^2(θ)`, we get:\n        *   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The expectation value `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The expression `cos(γBt)` oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    Both methods confirm that the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is `γB`.

Identify the Initial State\n*   The system is a spin-1/2 particle. The spin operator is `S` and its components are `Sx`, `Sy`, `Sz`.\n*   The magnetic moment is given by the vector relation `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, a magnetic field `B` is in the +Z direction.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the spin is in an energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B_z = -γB S_z`. \"Aligned\" typically implies the lowest energy state. The energy is lowest when the magnetic moment `μ` is parallel to the magnetic field `B`. For `μ = γS` (with γ > 0), this happens when the spin `S` is also parallel to `B`.\n*   The spin being aligned with the +Z direction means the particle is in the eigenstate of `S_z` with the maximum positive eigenvalue. This state is commonly denoted as `|+z⟩` or spin-up.\n*   So, the state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(t=0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### 2. Identify the New Hamiltonian and the Time Evolution\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched to the +Y direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n*   The \"sudden\" change means the state of the particle does not change at the instant `t=0`. So, the initial state for the new evolution is still `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n*   For `t > 0`, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian, `H = -μ ⋅ B_y = -γB S_y`.\n*   The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation, and the state at a later time `t` is given by `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n*   Substituting the new Hamiltonian, we get `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(iγBt S_y/ħ) |+z⟩`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value\n*   We need to find the average (which means the quantum mechanical expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `μ_z = γS_z`.\n*   The expectation value is `<μ_z>(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n*   Let's focus on calculating `<S_z>(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n\n### Method 1: Using Rotation Operators\n*   The operator `exp(iθ S_y/ħ)` represents a rotation of the state by an angle `θ` around the y-axis.\n*   In our case, the angle of rotation is `θ(t) = γBt`.\n*   The state `|ψ(t)⟩` is the initial state `|+z⟩` rotated by an angle `γBt` around the y-axis.\n*   Classical intuition helps here: a spin vector `S` pointing along Z, when subjected to a magnetic field along Y, will precess in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis.\n*   The projection of the spin vector onto the Z-axis will be `S_z(t) = |S| cos(ωt)`.\n*   The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n*   The quantum mechanical expectation value follows the classical motion. The initial expectation value is `<S_z>(0) = ⟨+z|S_z|+z⟩ = ħ/2`.\n*   Therefore, the expectation value at time `t` will be `<S_z>(t) = <S_z>(0) cos(ωt) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n*   Then, the expectation value of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n*   This is a sinusoidal oscillation with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n### Method 2: Energy Eigenstate Decomposition\n*   The new Hamiltonian is `H = -γBS_y`. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which are `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`.\n    *   `S_y |±y⟩ = ±(ħ/2) |±y⟩`.\n*   The energy eigenvalues are `E_± = -γB(±ħ/2)`. So, `E_+ = -γBħ/2` (for `|+y⟩`) and `E_- = +γBħ/2` (for `|-y⟩`).\n*   Any oscillation in the system will have a frequency related to the difference in energy eigenvalues: `ω = ΔE/ħ`.\n*   `ΔE = |E_- - E_+| = |(+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2)| = |γBħ| = γBħ` (assuming γ and B are positive).\n*   The oscillation frequency is `ω = ΔE/ħ = (γBħ)/ħ = γB`.\n*   This method works because the initial state `|+z⟩` is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`. Specifically, `|+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2`. Since both energy levels are populated in the initial state, the system will exhibit oscillations at the frequency corresponding to their energy difference.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth methods show that the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates according to `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\nMatching this with the given options:\nA) gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin 1/2 system, so its state can be described by a two-component spinor.\n*   The magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The spin operator `S` has components `Sx`, `Sy`, and `Sz`.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction: **B** = (0, 0, B).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(Sz * B)`.\n*   The particle's moment is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state, which is the eigenstate of `Sz` with positive spin projection. Let's call this state `|↑z⟩`.\n*   In the basis of `Sz` eigenstates, `|↑z⟩ = [1, 0]` and `|↓z⟩ = [0, 1]`. The initial state is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |↑z⟩`.\n*   The z-component of the spin operator in this basis is `Sz = (ħ/2) * σz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n*   For the initial state, the expectation value of `Sz` is `⟨ψ(0)|Sz|ψ(0)⟩ = ħ/2`.\n\n### 2. Understanding the New Dynamics\n\n*   At time t=0, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction: **B'** = (0, B, 0).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H = -μ ⋅ B' = -γB * Sy`.\n*   The spin operator in the y-direction is `Sy = (ħ/2) * σy = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n*   The state of the particle `|ψ(t)⟩` will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation with this new Hamiltonian `H`: `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Time Evolution of the State (Schrödinger Picture)\n\n*   Substitute `H` into the evolution operator: `U(t) = exp(-i(-γB * Sy)t / ħ) = exp(i * γBt * Sy / ħ)`.\n*   The term `γB` has units of angular frequency. Let's define the Larmor frequency as `ω = γB`.\n*   The evolution operator becomes `U(t) = exp(i * ωt * Sy / ħ)`. Substituting the matrix for `Sy`:\n    `U(t) = exp(i * ωt * (ħ/2) * σy / ħ) = exp(i * (ωt/2) * σy)`.\n*   We use the identity `exp(iθσk) = cos(θ)I + i*sin(θ)σk`, where `I` is the identity matrix and `σk` is a Pauli matrix.\n*   Here, `θ = ωt/2`. So,\n    `U(t) = cos(ωt/2) * I + i*sin(ωt/2) * σy`\n    `U(t) = cos(ωt/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i*sin(ωt/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + [[0, sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]` (This is a rotation matrix around the y-axis).\n*   Now, we find the state at time `t`: `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`.\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] * [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]]`\n*   In terms of the basis states, `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2)|↑z⟩ - sin(ωt/2)|↓z⟩`.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value of the Moment\n\n*   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μz⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|μz|ψ(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)⟩`.\n*   First, let's find `⟨Sz⟩(t)`.\n    `Sz|ψ(t)⟩ = Sz * (cos(ωt/2)|↑z⟩ - sin(ωt/2)|↓z⟩)`\n    `Sz|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2) * Sz|↑z⟩ - sin(ωt/2) * Sz|↓z⟩`\n    `Sz|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2) * (ħ/2)|↑z⟩ - sin(ωt/2) * (-ħ/2)|↓z⟩`\n    `Sz|ψ(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * (cos(ωt/2)|↑z⟩ + sin(ωt/2)|↓z⟩)`\n*   Now take the inner product with `⟨ψ(t)| = cos(ωt/2)⟨↑z| - sin(ωt/2)⟨↓z|`:\n    `⟨Sz⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)⟩`\n    `⟨Sz⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2)⟨↑z| - sin(ωt/2)⟨↓z|] * [cos(ωt/2)|↑z⟩ + sin(ωt/2)|↓z⟩]`\n*   Using the orthogonality of the basis states (`⟨↑z|↑z⟩=1`, `⟨↓z|↓z⟩=1`, `⟨↑z|↓z⟩=0`), we get:\n    `⟨Sz⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)]`\n*   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we have:\n    `⟨Sz⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`.\n*   Now, find the expectation value of the magnetic moment component:\n    `⟨μz⟩(t) = γ⟨Sz⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`.\n\n### 5. Identifying the Oscillation Frequency\n\n*   The average of the z-component of the moment is `⟨μz⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n*   The function `cos(Ωt)` describes an oscillation with angular frequency `Ω`.\n*   By comparing `cos(γBt)` with the general form `cos(Ωt)`, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation is `Ω = γB`.\n*   This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency. It describes the precession of the magnetic moment around the external magnetic field.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is `γB`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   **System:** A spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment vector **μ** related to its spin vector **S** by **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   **Initial Condition:** The particle is in a magnetic field **B_i** = B **ẑ** (pointing in the +Z direction). The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate.\n*   **Initial Hamiltonian:** The energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by the Hamiltonian H = -**μ** · **B**.\n    So, the initial Hamiltonian is H_i = - (γ**S**) · (B **ẑ**) = -γB S_z.\n*   **Eigenstates and Energies:** The operator S_z has two eigenstates for a spin-1/2 particle: spin-up |+>_z and spin-down |->_z.\n    *   S_z |+>_z = +(ħ/2) |+>_z, giving energy E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)\n    *   S_z |->_z = -(ħ/2) |->_z, giving energy E_- = +γB(ħ/2)\n*   **Initial State Vector:** \"Aligned with the field\" means the magnetic moment points in the same direction as the field (+Z), which corresponds to the spin-up state |+>_z. This is also the state of minimum energy (assuming γ > 0).\n    So, at t=0, the state of the particle is |ψ(0)> = |+>_z. In the standard S_z basis, this is represented by the column vector `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Time Evolution (t > 0)\n\n*   **New Condition:** At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B_f** = B **ŷ** (pointing in the +Y direction).\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** The Hamiltonian governing the system for t > 0 is H = -**μ** · **B_f** = -γB S_y.\n*   **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle at any time t > 0 is given by the Schrödinger equation's solution:\n    |ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)> = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>\n    Substituting H = -γB S_y, we get:\n    |ψ(t)> = e^(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |+>_z = e^(iγBS_yt/ħ) |+>_z\n\n### 3. Calculating the State Vector at Time t\n\nTo compute the evolution, we use the matrix representations in the S_z basis:\n*   The spin-y operator is S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli Y-matrix: σ_y = `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n*   The time evolution operator becomes: U(t) = e^(iγB(ħ/2)σ_y t/ħ) = e^(i(γBt/2)σ_y).\n*   We use the property of Pauli matrices: e^(iθσ_n) = I cos(θ) + iσ_n sin(θ), where I is the identity matrix.\n    Here, the angle θ = γBt/2 and the operator is σ_y.\n    U(t) = I cos(γBt/2) + iσ_y sin(γBt/2)\n    U(t) = `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` cos(γBt/2) + i `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]` sin(γBt/2)\n    U(t) = `[[cos(γBt/2), 0], [0, cos(γBt/2)]]` + `[[0, sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), 0]]`\n    U(t) = `[[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n*   Now, we find the state vector |ψ(t)>:\n    |ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)> = `[[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]` `[[1], [0]]`\n    |ψ(t)> = `[[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n\nThis means |ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2) |+>_z - sin(γBt/2) |->_z.\n\n### 4. Finding the Expectation Value of μ_z\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency of the *average* of the z-component of the particle's moment. The average is the quantum mechanical expectation value, `<μ_z(t)>`.\n*   <μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ <S_z(t)>\n*   We calculate <S_z(t)>:\n    <S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>\n    The S_z operator is S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)`[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    <S_z(t)> = `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]` * (ħ/2)`[[1, 0], [0, -1]]` * `[[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    <S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]` * `[[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    <S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]\n*   Using the trigonometric identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n    <S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)\n*   Therefore, the expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component is:\n    <μ_z(t)> = γ <S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)\n\n### 5. Identifying the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe expression for <μ_z(t)> is of the form A*cos(ωt), where A is the amplitude and ω is the angular frequency of oscillation.\nFrom <μ_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt), we can see that the angular frequency is:\nω = γB\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin's expectation value precesses around the new magnetic field direction (**ŷ**) at the Larmor frequency, ω_L = γB. The projection of this precessing vector onto the z-axis oscillates with this frequency.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State:**\n    The problem states that a spin-1/2 particle is initially \"aligned\" with a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state of the initial Hamiltonian `H_initial = -μ_z * B = -γ * S_z * B`. For a positive gyromagnetic ratio `γ`, the lowest energy corresponds to the spin pointing in the direction of the field. This is the spin-up state along the Z-axis. In Dirac notation, the initial state at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |↑z>`, which is the eigenstate of the spin operator `S_z` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian:**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution of the system is:\n    `H = -μ · B = -μ_y * B = -γ * S_y * B`\n    Here, `S_y` is the spin operator for the Y-direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:**\n    The state of the system `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The solution is given by:\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)>`\n    where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian `H`:\n    `U(t) = exp(-i(-γ * S_y * B)t / ħ) = exp(i * γ * B * t * S_y / ħ)`\n    So, the state at time `t` is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γ * B * t * S_y / ħ) |↑z>`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`.\n    `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)>`\n    Substituting the expression for `|ψ(t)>`:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <↑z| exp(-i * γ * B * t * S_y / ħ) * S_z * exp(i * γ * B * t * S_y / ħ) |↑z>`\n\n5.  **Simplify using Larmor Precession (Conceptual Approach):**\n    This problem describes a classic phenomenon known as Larmor precession. The torque `τ` on a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `τ = μ x B`. For spin, this translates to the equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector `<S>`:\n    `d<S>/dt = γ (<S> x B)`\n    This equation shows that the spin vector `<S>` precesses (rotates) around the direction of the magnetic field `B`.\n    *   The direction of precession is around the Y-axis (the direction of the new field `B`).\n    *   The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n    *   `ω_L = γB`\n\n    The initial spin vector is pointing along the +Z axis: `<S>(0) = <↑z| S |↑z> = (ħ/2) * ẑ`.\n    As this vector precesses around the Y-axis with angular frequency `ω_L = γB`, its components change. The z-component of the spin vector at time `t` is given by the projection of the precessing vector onto the Z-axis:\n    `<S_z>(t) = |<S>(0)| * cos(ω_L * t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    Therefore, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n6.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The expression for `<μ_z>(t)` is `γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. This is a cosine function of time `t`. The general form of an oscillation is `A*cos(ωt + φ)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n    By comparing `cos(γBt)` with `cos(ωt)`, we can directly identify the angular oscillation frequency `ω` as:\n    `ω = γB`\n\n7.  **Match with Options:**\n    The calculated oscillation frequency is `γB`. This matches option B.\n\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle.\n    *   The initial magnetic field is in the +Z direction: `B_initial = B * z_hat`.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment is `mu = gamma * S`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator and `gamma` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in the energy eigenstate where the spin is parallel to the field. The Hamiltonian for the initial situation is `H_initial = -mu . B_initial = -gamma * B * S_z`. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`). To be aligned with the +Z field, the spin must be in the `|+z>` state, which is the lower energy state.\n    *   Therefore, the state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian for Time Evolution:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off, and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the +Y direction: `B_new = B * y_hat`.\n    *   For `t > 0`, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian, `H_new`.\n    *   `H_new = -mu . B_new = -gamma * S . (B * y_hat) = -gamma * B * S_y`.\n    *   `S_y` is the y-component of the spin operator.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting `H_new`, we get: `U(t) = exp(-i * (-gamma * B * S_y) * t / ħ) = exp(i * gamma * B * t * S_y / ħ)`.\n    *   So, `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * gamma * B * t * S_y / ħ) |+z>`.\n    *   For a spin-1/2 particle, `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix.\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * gamma * B * t * (ħ/2) * σ_y / ħ) |+z> = exp(i * (gamma * B * t / 2) * σ_y) |+z>`.\n    *   Let `α = gamma * B * t / 2`. The expression simplifies to `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * α * σ_y) |+z>`.\n    *   We use the identity `exp(i * α * σ_y) = I * cos(α) + i * σ_y * sin(α)`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n    *   So, `|ψ(t)> = (I * cos(α) + i * σ_y * sin(α)) |+z>`.\n    *   In the standard Z-basis, `|+z> = [[1], [0]]` and `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   `σ_y |+z> = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [[1], [0]] = [[0], [i]] = i * [[0], [1]] = i * |-z>`.\n    *   Substituting this back: `|ψ(t)> = cos(α)|+z> + i * (i * |-z>) * sin(α) = cos(α)|+z> - sin(α)|-z>`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-component of the Moment:**\n    *   We need to find the average (expectation value) of `μ_z`, which is `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = gamma * S_z`, this is `<μ_z(t)> = gamma * <S_z(t)>`, where `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   First, let's operate with `S_z` on `|ψ(t)>`:\n        `S_z |ψ(t)> = S_z * (cos(α)|+z> - sin(α)|-z>)`\n        `S_z |ψ(t)> = cos(α) * S_z |+z> - sin(α) * S_z |-z>`\n        Using `S_z |±z> = ±(ħ/2)|±z>`, we get:\n        `S_z |ψ(t)> = cos(α) * (ħ/2)|+z> - sin(α) * (-ħ/2)|-z> = (ħ/2) * (cos(α)|+z> + sin(α)|-z>)`.\n    *   Now, we compute the inner product `<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`:\n        `<ψ(t)| = cos(α)<+z| - sin(α)<-z|`.\n        `<S_z(t)> = (cos(α)<+z| - sin(α)<-z|) * (ħ/2) * (cos(α)|+z> + sin(α)|-z>)`.\n        Using the orthogonality relations (`<+z|+z> = 1`, `<+z|-z> = 0`, etc.), this simplifies to:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * (cos(α) * cos(α) - sin(α) * sin(α)) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(α) - sin²(α))`.\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2α) = cos²(α) - sin²(α)`, we have:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(2α)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   Now substitute back `α = gamma * B * t / 2`.\n    *   `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * [gamma * B * t / 2]) = (ħ/2) * cos(gamma * B * t)`.\n    *   The expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component is:\n        `<μ_z(t)> = gamma * <S_z(t)> = gamma * (ħ/2) * cos(gamma * B * t)`.\n    *   This expression describes an oscillation of the form `A * cos(ωt)`. The angular frequency of oscillation `ω` is the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine function.\n    *   By comparison, the angular frequency `ω = gamma * B`.\n    *   This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `gamma * B`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThank you for providing the supposed output. However, the output you've provided, `hbar*gamma*hbar*cos(hbar*B*gamma*t)/2`, appears to be physically incorrect due to a dimensional inconsistency. Let's analyze why.\n\n**Analysis of the Provided Output:**\n\n1.  The argument of any trigonometric function (like cosine) must be dimensionless.\n2.  Let's check the units of the term inside the cosine, `hbar*B*gamma*t`:\n    *   The gyromagnetic ratio `gamma` (`γ`) has units of inverse-Tesla-seconds (`1 / (T·s)`).\n    *   The magnetic field `B` has units of Tesla (`T`).\n    *   Time `t` has units of seconds (`s`).\n    *   The reduced Planck constant `hbar` (`ħ`) has units of Joule-seconds (`J·s`).\n3.  Combining these, the units of `hbar*B*gamma*t` are:\n    `(J·s) * (T) * (1 / (T·s)) * (s) = J·s` (Joule-seconds)\n4.  Since `J·s` is not a dimensionless quantity, the expression `cos(hbar*B*gamma*t)` is physically invalid. It is likely there was an error in the execution environment that produced this result.\n\n**Revisiting the Correct Derivation:**\n\nMy previous corrected code and theoretical derivation both lead to the physically correct expression. The correct result from the code should be:\n\n`Expectation value of mu_z(t) is: hbar*gamma*cos(B*gamma*t)/2`\n\nLet's re-analyze this correct expression: `<μ_z>(t) = (ħγ/2) cos(γBt)`.\n\n*   **Amplitude:** The oscillation has an amplitude of `ħγ/2`, which is the magnitude of the z-component of the magnetic moment for a spin-up state.\n*   **Oscillation Term:** The oscillation is described by the `cos(γBt)` term.\n*   **Frequency:** The standard form for an oscillation is `cos(ωt)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency. By comparing `cos(γBt)` to `cos(ωt)`, we can directly identify the angular frequency of oscillation as `ω = γB`.\n\nThis frequency `ω = γB` is the Larmor frequency, which describes the precession rate of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe z-component of the particle's magnetic moment oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
