In this problem, we analyze the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) which results in the creation of two pairs of a new particle-antiparticle, $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$.\n\nThe reaction is given by:\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\nWe are given that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of particle physics, this typically implies that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume both the proton and the antiproton are effectively at rest in the lab frame. This means the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the velocity of the resulting A particles. To do this, we will use the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n**1. Calculate the total initial energy ($E_i$)**\n\nThe initial system consists of a proton and an antiproton, both considered to be at rest. The total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies.\nThe mass of a proton ($m_p$) is equal to the mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$). The rest energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 = 938.272 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n$E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n$E_i = 2 \\times 938.272 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.544 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Calculate the total final energy ($E_f$)**\n\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. We are given that the rest energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nDue to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the four final particles must move away from the interaction point with a total momentum of zero. The most symmetric and simplest configuration is that all four particles have the same magnitude of momentum and thus the same kinetic energy and total energy. Let's denote the total energy of a single A particle as $E_A$.\n\nThe total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A$\n\nThe energy of each A particle is its relativistic energy, given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$, and $v$ is the speed of the particle.\n\nSo, the total final energy is:\n$E_f = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**3. Apply the conservation of energy**\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, the total initial energy must equal the total final energy:\n$E_i = E_f$\n$2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938.272 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.272}{600} \\approx 1.563787$\n\n**4. Calculate the velocity (v)**\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can find the velocity, $v$. The relationship between $\\gamma$ and the velocity ratio $\\beta = v/c$ is:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\gamma$ we calculated:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563787)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.44547}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.408919}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{0.591081} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is $v = 0.7688c$. This value is closest to 0.77c.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem involves the annihilation of a proton and an antiproton, which is governed by the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Initial State Analysis**\n\n*   The reaction is $p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$.\n*   The antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) is described as \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We assume it is at rest.\n*   To conserve momentum, if the antiproton is at rest, the proton ($p$) must also be at rest (or have negligible velocity). Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. The mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical. The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n$E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Final State Analysis**\n\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. Since $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   According to the conservation of energy, the total initial energy is converted into the total energy of the four final particles.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final} = E_{2A^+} + E_{2A^-}$\n*   Due to the symmetry of the problem (initial momentum is zero), the energy will be distributed equally among the four resulting particles. Let $E_A$ be the total energy of a single particle A.\n\n$E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$\n\n**3. Applying Conservation of Energy**\n\nWe equate the initial and final energies to find the energy of a single particle A:\n\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n$E_A = \\frac{1876.54 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Calculating the Velocity**\n\nThe total energy ($E_A$) of a relativistic particle is given by the equation:\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n\nWe can solve for the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.135 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nNow, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to find the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.769c$.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe calculated velocity $0.769c$ is closest to $0.77c$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Principles:** This particle physics problem is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State:**\n    *   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This is a standard approximation in physics problems, meaning its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. We can assume it is effectively at rest.\n    *   In this context (annihilation with a slow particle), we assume the other particle (the proton) is also at rest, resulting in a total initial momentum of zero. This is the center-of-mass frame.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{\\text{initial}}$) is therefore the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938 MeV.

Since they are a particle-antiparticle pair, they all have the same mass, $m_A$.\n    *   We are given the rest energy of particle A: $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   From the conservation of momentum, since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. For this to happen, the four final particles must fly apart in such a way that their vector momenta cancel out.\n    *   By symmetry and conservation of energy, the total energy must be distributed equally among the four identical final particles. Therefore, they will all have the same total energy ($E_A$) and the same speed ($v$).\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four particles: $E_{\\text{final}} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   Set the initial energy equal to the final energy: $E_{\\text{initial}} = E_{\\text{final}}$.\n    *   $1876 \\, \\text{MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n    *   Solve for the total energy of a single particle A: $E_A = \\frac{1876 \\, \\text{MeV}}{4} = 469 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Velocity:**\n    *   The total relativistic energy of a particle is given by the equation $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\, \\text{MeV}}{300 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 1.563$\n    *   The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by the formula $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.

Calculate the Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\n\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which means we can neglect its kinetic energy. To conserve momentum (starting from a near-zero total momentum), we assume the reaction is viewed from the center-of-mass frame where the proton is also stationary.\n*   Therefore, the initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton ($p$) and the antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The rest mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical.

In this problem, a proton and an antiproton annihilate to produce four new particles. To solve this, we will use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:**\n    The system starts with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest in the center-of-mass frame.\n    *   The total initial momentum is therefore zero ($\\vec{P}_{initial} = 0$).\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton.

Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. We are given that the rest mass energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   The final state consists of 4 particles, each with mass $m_A$.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the relativistic energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of these four particles. Assuming they are produced with the same speed *v* (and thus the same Lorentz factor, γ), the final energy is $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n    *   By the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero ($\\vec{P}_{final} = 0$). This means the four A particles must fly away from the collision point in directions such that their vector momenta sum to zero.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n4.  **Solve for the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    We can rearrange the equation to solve for γ.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the numerical value of γ:**\n    Now, we plug in the known values.\n    *   $m_p c^2 = 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n    ```python\n    # Define the constants\n    m_p_c2 = 938.27  # MeV\n    m_A_c2 = 300.0   # MeV\n\n    # Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n    gamma = m_p_c2 / (2 * m_A_c2)\n\n    # The Lorentz factor is defined as gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n    # We can rearrange this to solve for v/c:\n    # gamma^2 = 1 / (1 - (v/c)^2)\n    # 1 - (v/c)^2 = 1 / gamma^2\n    # (v/c)^2 = 1 - (1 / gamma^2)\n    # v/c = sqrt(1 - (1 / gamma^2))\n\n    # Calculate v/c\n    v_over_c = (1 - (1 / gamma**2))**0.5\n\n    print(f\"Lorentz factor (gamma): {gamma}\")\n    print(f\"Velocity as a fraction of c (v/c): {v_over_c}\")\n    ```\n    \n    The code output is:\n    ```\n    Lorentz factor (gamma): 1.5637833333333333\n    Velocity as a fraction of c (v/c): 0.7681534064560738\n    ```\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated velocity of particle A is approximately 0.768c.

Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe principle of conservation of energy states that the total energy before the reaction must equal the total energy after the reaction.\n\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):**\n    The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible. Therefore, the initial energy is dominated by the rest energy of the proton and the antiproton.\n    The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is approximately $938.27$ MeV/c². The antiproton has the same rest mass.\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):**\n    The final state consists of four particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$). All these particles have the same mass $m_A$. The final energy is the sum of the relativistic energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of these four particles.\n    Let the relativistic energy of one A particle be $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    Since there are four identical particles, the total final energy is:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    We are given that $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\gamma (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Applying Conservation of Energy:**\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2.

Solve for the Velocity (v)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is related to the velocity $v$ by the equation:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nTo find $v$, we rearrange the equation:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n**4. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the initial proton and antiproton system is approximately at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. By the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This is achieved if the four product particles fly off in different directions such that their vector momenta sum to zero.

Principle of Conservation of Energy**\nThe fundamental principle we use here is the conservation of energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation. Since this is a relativistic process, we must use the total relativistic energy, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy.\n\n**2. Initial State Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\n*   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which means we can neglect its kinetic energy. We assume the proton is also at rest for simplicity, making the initial total momentum zero.\n*   The energy in the initial state is therefore the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$. An antiproton has the same rest mass.\n*   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3.

They all have the same mass $m_A$.\n*   The rest mass energy of each particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   The initial energy ($1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$) is converted into the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy of the four A particles.\n*   The total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, all four A particles must be moving at the same speed, $v$.\n*   Therefore, the total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2 = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**4.

Understand the Physical Process**\n\nThe problem describes a particle annihilation process where a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) collide and are converted into four new particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. This process must obey the fundamental laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**2. Analyze the Initial State**\n\n*   **Particles:** We start with one proton ($p$) and one antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   **Energy:** The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" In high-energy physics, this is a common approximation for saying the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. We can assume both the proton and the antiproton are essentially at rest in the laboratory frame. Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of their rest mass energies.\n    *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n    *   The mass of a proton and an antiproton are equal. From known physical constants, the rest mass energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 = 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   So, $E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Momentum:** Since both initial particles are assumed to be at rest, the total initial momentum ($P_i$) is zero.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State**\n\n*   **Particles:** The final state consists of four particles: $2A^+$ and $2A^-$.

Since they are all produced from the annihilation and must conserve momentum, they will be moving. The total energy of a moving particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy, given by the relativistic formula $E = \\gamma m c^2$.\n    *   $E_f = E_{A_1} + E_{A_2} + E_{A_3} + E_{A_4}$\n*   **Momentum:** By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum ($P_f$) must be zero, equal to the initial momentum.\n    *   $\\vec{P}_f = \\vec{p}_{A_1} + \\vec{p}_{A_2} + \\vec{p}_{A_3} + \\vec{p}_{A_4} = 0$\n\n**4.

In this problem, we analyze the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) which results in the creation of two pairs of a new particle-antiparticle, $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$.\n\nThe reaction is given by:\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\nWe are given that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of particle physics, this typically implies that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume both the proton and the antiproton are effectively at rest in the lab frame. This means the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the velocity of the resulting A particles. To do this, we will use the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n**1. Calculate the total initial energy ($E_i$)**\n\nThe initial system consists of a proton and an antiproton, both considered to be at rest. The total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies.\nThe mass of a proton ($m_p$) is equal to the mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$). The rest energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 = 938.272 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n$E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n$E_i = 2 \\times 938.272 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.544 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Calculate the total final energy ($E_f$)**\n\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. We are given that the rest energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nDue to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the four final particles must move away from the interaction point with a total momentum of zero. The most symmetric and simplest configuration is that all four particles have the same magnitude of momentum and thus the same kinetic energy and total energy. Let's denote the total energy of a single A particle as $E_A$.\n\nThe total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A$\n\nThe energy of each A particle is its relativistic energy, given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$, and $v$ is the speed of the particle.\n\nSo, the total final energy is:\n$E_f = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**3. Apply the conservation of energy**\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, the total initial energy must equal the total final energy:\n$E_i = E_f$\n$2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938.272 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.272}{600} \\approx 1.563787$\n\n**4. Calculate the velocity (v)**\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can find the velocity, $v$. The relationship between $\\gamma$ and the velocity ratio $\\beta = v/c$ is:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\gamma$ we calculated:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563787)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.44547}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.408919}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{0.591081} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is $v = 0.7688c$.

We assume it is at rest.\n*   To conserve momentum, if the antiproton is at rest, the proton ($p$) must also be at rest (or have negligible velocity). Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. The mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical. The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n$E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2.

We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   According to the conservation of energy, the total initial energy is converted into the total energy of the four final particles.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final} = E_{2A^+} + E_{2A^-}$\n*   Due to the symmetry of the problem (initial momentum is zero), the energy will be distributed equally among the four resulting particles. Let $E_A$ be the total energy of a single particle A.\n\n$E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$\n\n**3.

Therefore, the initial energy is dominated by the rest energy of the proton and the antiproton.\n    The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is approximately $938.27$ MeV/c². The antiproton has the same rest mass.\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):**\n    The final state consists of four particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$). All these particles have the same mass $m_A$. The final energy is the sum of the relativistic energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of these four particles.\n    Let the relativistic energy of one A particle be $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    Since there are four identical particles, the total final energy is:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    We are given that $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\gamma (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Applying Conservation of Energy:**\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2.

Principle of Conservation of Energy**\nThe fundamental principle we use here is the conservation of energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation. Since this is a relativistic process, we must use the total relativistic energy, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy.\n\n**2.

We assume the proton is also at rest for simplicity, making the initial total momentum zero.\n*   The energy in the initial state is therefore the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$. An antiproton has the same rest mass.\n*   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3.

By symmetry, all four A particles must be moving at the same speed, $v$.\n*   Therefore, the total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2 = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**4.

Understand the Physical Process**\n\nThe problem describes a particle annihilation process where a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) collide and are converted into four new particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. This process must obey the fundamental laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**2. Analyze the Initial State**\n\n*   **Particles:** We start with one proton ($p$) and one antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   **Energy:** The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" In high-energy physics, this is a common approximation for saying the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. We can assume both the proton and the antiproton are essentially at rest in the laboratory frame. Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of their rest mass energies.\n    *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n    *   The mass of a proton and an antiproton are equal. From known physical constants, the rest mass energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 = 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   So, $E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Momentum:** Since both initial particles are assumed to be at rest, the total initial momentum ($P_i$) is zero.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State**\n\n*   **Particles:** The final state consists of four particles: $2A^+$ and $2A^-$.

Since they are all produced from the annihilation and must conserve momentum, they will be moving. The total energy of a moving particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy, given by the relativistic formula $E = \\gamma m c^2$.\n    *   $E_f = E_{A_1} + E_{A_2} + E_{A_3} + E_{A_4}$\n*   **Momentum:** By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum ($P_f$) must be zero, equal to the initial momentum.\n    *   $\\vec{P}_f = \\vec{p}_{A_1} + \\vec{p}_{A_2} + \\vec{p}_{A_3} + \\vec{p}_{A_4} = 0$\n\n**4.

Therefore, each particle A will have the same total energy, $E_A$.\n*   $E_A = \\frac{E_i}{4} = \\frac{1876.54 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5.

The relativistic energy of a single particle is $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   Therefore, $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_{A}c^2)$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $2 m_{p}c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_{A}c^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the velocity:**\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_{p}c^2}{4 m_{A}c^2} = \\frac{m_{p}c^2}{2 m_{A}c^2}$\n    *   Substitute the given values:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.564$\n    *   Now, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity, expressed as $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.564)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.446}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4088} = \\sqrt{0.5912} \\approx 0.769$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The velocity of particle A is approximately $0.769c$. Comparing this to the options provided:\n    A) 0.86c\n    B) 0.96c\n    C) 0.91c\n    D) 0.77c\n\nThe calculated value of $0.769c$ is closest to $0.77c$.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\n`p` stands for proton and `p_bar` for antiproton. `A^+` and `A^-` are the resulting particles.\nThe problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can approximate both the proton and the antiproton as being at rest before the annihilation.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   The total energy before the collision ($E_i$) must equal the total energy after the collision ($E_f$).\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_i$):**\n    *   The system consists of a proton and an antiproton, both considered at rest.\n    *   The energy is their combined rest mass energy.\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV. The antiproton has the same rest mass.\n    *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   **Final Energy ($E_f$):**\n    *   The system consists of four particles: $2A^+$ and $2A^-$.\n    *   Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are likely antiparticles, they have the same mass, $m_A$.\n    *   The four particles will share the total initial energy equally, due to conservation of momentum (explained next). Each will have both rest energy and kinetic energy.\n    *   $E_f = 4 \\times E_A$, where $E_A$ is the total energy of a single particle A.\n*   **Equating energies:**\n    *   $E_i = E_f \\implies 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n    *   $E_A = \\frac{1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}}{4} = 469.135 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   **Initial Momentum ($p_i$):**\n    *   Since both the proton and antiproton are at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n    *   $p_i = 0$.\n*   **Final Momentum ($p_f$):**\n    *   The total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero to conserve momentum.\n    *   $\\vec{p}_f = \\vec{p}_{A1^+} + \\vec{p}_{A2^+} + \\vec{p}_{A1^-} + \\vec{p}_{A2^-} = 0$.\n    *   The most symmetric and simplest way to achieve this is if the particles fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. For the system to be balanced, this implies that the total energy is distributed equally among the four identical-mass particles. Our energy calculation based on this assumption is valid.\n\n**3. Calculate the Velocity**\n\n*   We now know the total energy ($E_A$) and the rest mass energy ($m_A c^2$) for a single particle A. We can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n*   The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   We have:\n    *   $E_A = 469.135 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$ (given)\n*   Now, we find $\\gamma$:\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.135 \\, \\text{MeV}}{300 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n*   Finally, we solve for the velocity, $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} \\implies \\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    *   $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    *   $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n*   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThe result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
