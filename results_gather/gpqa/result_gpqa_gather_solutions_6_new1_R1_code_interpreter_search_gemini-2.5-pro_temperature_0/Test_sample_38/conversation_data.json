The fundamental principle of quantum mechanics for this task is the **normalization of the wave function**. This principle states that the total probability of finding the particle within the entire space where it is allowed to exist must be equal to 1.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Mathematical Condition**: The probability of finding the particle at a position `x` is given by the probability density, `P(x) = |ψ(x)|²`. The normalization condition is therefore:\n    ∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n    The problem states that the particles are only found between `x=1` and `x=3`. These are the limits of our integration.\n    ∫ [from 1 to 3] |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability Density `|ψ(x)|²`**: The wave function `ψ(x)` is a complex number. For any complex number `z = Re + i*Im`, the square of its magnitude is `|z|² = (Re)² + (Im)²`.\n    *   Given wave function: `ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i`\n    *   Real part: `Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)`\n    *   Imaginary part: `Im(ψ) = -0.5`\n    *   Therefore, the probability density is:\n        `|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25`\n\n4.  **Set Up and Solve the Definite Integral**: We substitute the probability density into the normalization equation:\n    ∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n    We can solve the integral by splitting it into two parts:\n    *   **Part 1**: `∫[1,3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² * [ln(1 + x)]` evaluated from 1 to 3.\n        `= a² * (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)) = a² * (ln(4) - ln(2))`\n        Using the logarithm property `ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B)`, this simplifies to `a² * ln(2)`.\n    *   **Part 2**: `∫[1,3] 0.25 dx = [0.25x]` evaluated from 1 to 3.\n        `= (0.25 * 3) - (0.25 * 1) = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5`.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Constant \"a\"**: Now, we combine the results and set the sum equal to 1:\n    `a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1`\n    Isolating the term with `a`:\n    `a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5`\n    `a² * ln(2) = 0.5`\n    `a² = 0.5 / ln(2)`\n    `a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value**: Using the value of the natural logarithm of 2 (`ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`):\n    `a ≈ sqrt(0.5 / 0.6931) ≈ sqrt(0.7214) ≈ 0.8493`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated value `a ≈ 0.8493` is closest to the numerical value `0.85`.

The correct approach, identified by the vast majority of the candidate answers, is to use the normalization principle.\n\n**1. The Normalization Principle**\nThe fundamental principle is that the total probability of finding the particle within the region it is known to exist must be 1. The probability of finding the particle at a position `x` is given by the probability density, `P(x)`, which is the square of the magnitude of the wave function, `|ψ(x)|²`. The problem states the particle is only found between `x=1` and `x=3`, so the normalization condition is:\n∫ [from 1 to 3] |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n**2. Calculate the Probability Density |ψ(x)|²**\nThe wave function is a complex number: `ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i`.\nFor a complex number `z = Re + i*Im`, the square of its magnitude is `|z|² = (Re)² + (Im)²`.\n*   Real part: `Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)`\n*   Imaginary part: `Im(ψ) = -0.5`\n\nTherefore, the probability density is:\n`|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25`\n\n**3. Set Up and Solve the Normalization Integral**\nWe substitute the probability density into the normalization equation:\n∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nThe integral is solved by separating it into two parts:\n*   **Part 1**: ∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² * [ln(1 + x)] from 1 to 3\n    *   = a² * (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1))\n    *   = a² * (ln(4) - ln(2))\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B)`, this simplifies to `a² * ln(2)`.\n*   **Part 2**: ∫ [from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = [0.25x] from 1 to 3\n    *   = (0.25 * 3) - (0.25 * 1)\n    *   = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5\n\n**4. Solve for \"a\"**\nSubstitute the results back into the normalization equation:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, solve for 'a' algebraically:\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n**5. Calculate the Numerical Value**\nUsing the value of the natural logarithm of 2, `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`:\na ≈ sqrt(0.5 / 0.6931)\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.8493\n\n**6.
