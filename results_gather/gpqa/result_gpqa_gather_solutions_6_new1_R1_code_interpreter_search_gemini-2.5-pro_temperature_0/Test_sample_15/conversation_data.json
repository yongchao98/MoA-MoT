This property typically arises from the presence of one or more stereocenters and the absence of internal elements of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. When a compound's name includes specific stereochemical descriptors like (R) or (S), it refers to a single enantiomer, which is optically active by definition, provided the molecule is not a meso compound.\n\nLet's analyze each compound step-by-step:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene.

Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable.

It is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, and two different paths around the ring due to the double bond's position (`-CH2-CH=CH-` vs. `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This molecule is highly symmetrical and possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH2 group). The presence of symmetry planes makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.

A compound is optically active if its molecular structure is chiral and it is not present as a 50:50 racemic mixture. Chirality means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key features to look for are chiral centers and the absence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The stereochemical descriptors in the names, such as (R), (S), etc., indicate that we are considering a single stereoisomer.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound:**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to it lie in a single plane. This planarity creates a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule, making it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`, which specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers.

However, the molecule is symmetrical, and the `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a *meso* compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different paths around the ring due to the position of the double bond. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, indicating a single, chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-*cis* isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This molecule is highly symmetrical and possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH₂ group). The presence of symmetry planes makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of this molecule's structure, `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`, reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center.

The `(2R,3S)` configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and optically inactive.\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. As a single specified enantiomer, it is optically active.\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom bonded to the -OH group is a chiral center because the paths around the ring are different. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single chiral molecule and thus optically active.\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This is the all-cis isomer. The molecule is highly symmetrical and possesses multiple planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH₂ group).

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which means it lacks elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound step-by-step:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms of the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral.

Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This highly symmetrical arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry (for example, a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH₂ group).

A compound is optically active if it is chiral (its mirror image is non-superimposable) and it is not present as a 50:50 racemic mixture. The use of stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), or others in the name implies that we are considering a single, pure stereoisomer.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`, which specify the exact three-dimensional arrangement at two chiral centers. Naming a specific, non-meso stereoisomer indicates that we are considering a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3) and a symmetrical structure. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, which makes this a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different paths around the ring (`-CH2-CH=CH-` vs. `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single chiral molecule. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-`cis` isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This highly symmetrical arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposing CH₂ group bisects the molecule. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of this molecule's structure, `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`, reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, and no other carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. The molecule is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe following three compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.
