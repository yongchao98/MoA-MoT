  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nA) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nB) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nC) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene\nD) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThis problem requires us to deduce the structures of two compounds in a mixture by analyzing their combined 1H NMR spectrum. Let's break down the problem by analyzing the expected spectrum for each candidate compound and then see which pair matches the given data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Given Spectral Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This tells us that each compound in the mixture produces a single, sharp signal (a singlet) in the aromatic region.\n    *   The 1:1 ratio of these two signals means that the number of aromatic protons in compound A is equal to the number of aromatic protons in compound B (since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   These signals correspond to the methyl (or ethyl) groups attached to the aromatic rings.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's check if the molecular formula C10H14 is correct for all options and predict their spectra.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Formula OK)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a **single singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Formula OK)\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry passes through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Formula OK)\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent, but they are adjacent to each other. They will split each other, resulting in an AB quartet (or two doublets), **not a singlet**. This compound can be eliminated.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** C6H4(CH2CH3)2 = C10H14. (Formula OK)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent. They will appear as a **single singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show splitting: a quartet (4H) for the -CH2- groups and a triplet (6H) for the -CH3- groups. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be eliminated.\n\n**3. Identify the Correct Pair of Compounds**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can eliminate 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. The only two remaining candidates that fit the aromatic signal description (producing a singlet) are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\nLet's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds matches all the spectral data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes a 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes a 2H singlet.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, this will result in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   Let's consider the total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture: 12H from the first compound + 12H from the second = 24H total.\n    *   The observed ratio is 2:1:1. The sum of the ratio parts is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   The actual integration for the three signals will be:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Now let's see if our chosen pair can produce signals with these integrations:\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet of **12H**. This matches our largest signal.\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n        *   The 6H signal from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene can be our second signal.\n        *   For the third signal, we need an integration of 6H. This can be explained if the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene accidentally have the same chemical shift and overlap, appearing as a single 6H peak. This is a common feature in NMR problems.\n    *   Therefore, the combined spectrum would show three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H, which gives the required **2:1:1 ratio**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that matches all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture based on the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n### 1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This indicates that the two compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, and each compound has only one type of aromatic proton (all aromatic protons on a given molecule are chemically equivalent). The 1:1 ratio of the signals confirms the 1:1 molar ratio of the compounds, as long as each compound has the same number of aromatic protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. These signals represent the combined methyl (or other alkyl) protons from both compounds in the mixture. All signals are singlets, meaning there is no splitting, which is characteristic of methyl groups not adjacent to any protons.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Compound Option\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C2, the one at C5, and the two equivalent ones at C1 and C3. This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 3H:3H:6H (or 1:1:2).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the \"outer\" methyls (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" methyls (C2, C3). This will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H, giving a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, producing **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups, not just methyl groups. The spectrum would show a quartet (for the -CH2-) and a triplet (for the -CH3-), not just singlets. Therefore, this compound can be eliminated.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Mixture Options\n\nThe mixture must contain two compounds that each give a single peak in the aromatic region. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers fit this criterion. Since they each have 2 aromatic protons, a 1:1 mixture will correctly produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\nNow, we must find the combination whose alkyl signals add up to three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: Two singlets (6H, 6H) from 1,2,3,4-TMB and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would result in up to five signals, which does not match the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: One singlet (12H) from 1,2,4,5-TMB and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This gives a total of four signals, which only matches the data if there is an accidental overlap of signals. To get a 2:1:1 ratio (which corresponds to 12H:6H:6H), the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB would need to overlap, which is unlikely as they are in different chemical environments.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture gives two 2H singlets, which is a 1:1 ratio. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each).\n    *   **Combined alkyl signals:** The mixture will show three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   **Ratio:** The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data without needing to assume any accidental signal overlaps.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that perfectly accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem Statement:** First, we'll break down the information provided by the 1H NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n    *   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This implies the mixture contains two different compounds, and each compound contributes one aromatic singlet. Since the mixture is 1:1, the number of protons for each aromatic singlet must be the same.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This is the combined signal from the aliphatic protons of both compounds in the mixture.\n\n2.  **Analyze Individual Candidate Compounds:** We will predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four options to see what signals they would produce on their own. We'll focus on the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their relative integration (number of protons).\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it has one type of aromatic proton (2H) and one type of methyl group (12H). This gives 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** It has one plane of symmetry. This results in one type of aromatic proton (2H), and three different types of methyl groups (6H, 3H, 3H). This gives 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H, a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** It has one plane of symmetry. This results in one type of aromatic proton (2H) and two different types of methyl groups (6H, 6H). This gives 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H, a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups, which would produce quartets and triplets in the aliphatic region, not just singlets. Therefore, it can be eliminated from consideration.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Mixtures (Options A-D):** We will combine the predicted spectra for the pairs of compounds in each option (assuming a 1:1 mixture) and see which one matches the observed data.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** A 1:1 mixture of any two of the tetramethylbenzene isomers will produce two 2H aromatic singlets, matching the observed 1:1 ratio. So, we must use the aliphatic region to distinguish them.\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** We will sum the aliphatic signals for each pair and check if the result is three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation and Final Answer:** A Python script will be used to systematically perform the analysis described above and identify the correct option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes 1H NMR data for a mixture of two aromatic compounds to identify them.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the provided 1H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture.\")\n    print(\"  - Aromatic Region: 2 singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\")\n    print(\"  - Aliphatic Region: 3 singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the spectral characteristics of each candidate compound.\n    # The data is stored as: { \"aromatic_H\": count, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [list_of_H_counts] }\n    compounds = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 2, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [12]},\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 2, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [6, 3, 3]},\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 2, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [6, 6]},\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 4, \"aliphatic_integrations\": \"non-singlets\"}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Predicted 1H NMR signals for individual compounds.\")\n    for name, data in compounds.items():\n        print(f\"  - {name}:\")\n        if isinstance(data[\"aliphatic_integrations\"], list):\n            print(f\"    - Aromatic: 1 singlet ({data['aromatic_H']}H)\")\n            print(f\"    - Aliphatic: {len(data['aliphatic_integrations'])} singlet(s) with integrations {data['aliphatic_integrations']}H\")\n        else:\n            print(\"    - Aliphatic signals are not all singlets, so this compound is excluded.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 3: Define the options and evaluate them.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"B\": (\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\"),\n        \"C\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"D\": (\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\")\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Evaluating each option for a 1:1 mixture.\")\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, (name1, name2) in options.items():\n        print(f\"\\nTesting Option {option}: {name1} and {name2}\")\n        comp1 = compounds[name1]\n        comp2 = compounds[name2]\n\n        # Rule out any option with 1,4-diethylbenzene\n        if comp1[\"aliphatic_integrations\"] == \"non-singlets\" or comp2[\"aliphatic_integrations\"] == \"non-singlets\":\n            print(\"  - Result: FAILED.

The total number of carbons is 6 + 4 = 10. The total number of hydrogens is 2 + (4 * 3) = 14. The formula is C10H14. This applies to options 1, 2, and 3.\n*   **Diethylbenzene:** The formula is C6H4(C2H5)2. The total number of carbons is 6 + (2 * 2) = 10. The total number of hydrogens is 4 + (2 * 5) = 14. The formula is C10H14. This applies to option 4.\n*   **Conclusion:** All four compounds have the correct molecular formula.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of unique proton environments.\n\n*   **1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical. There are two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will appear as a **single singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 signals total (one 2H aromatic singlet, one 12H alkyl singlet).\n\n*   **2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Less symmetrical. There is one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will appear as **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 5 signals total (two 1H aromatic singlets, three alkyl singlets with 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **3. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent (ortho) to each other. While they would technically couple, in such a symmetrical environment (an AA' system), they often appear as a **single singlet** (or a narrow multiplet that looks like a singlet). The integration is **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct types of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 3 signals total (one 2H aromatic singlet, two 6H alkyl singlets).\n\n*   **4. 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent. They will appear as a **single singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The protons within the ethyl group are not.\n        *   The -CH2- protons will be a **quartet** (split by the -CH3) with an integration of **4H**.\n        *   The -CH3- protons will be a **triplet** (split by the -CH2-) with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 3 signals total (one aromatic singlet, one alkyl quartet, one alkyl triplet). This is immediately ruled out because the problem states all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Mixture Spectrum**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that produces the observed spectrum. We can eliminate any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene (Option C) because it would produce a quartet and a triplet. We are left with options A, B, and D.\n\nLet's test the remaining combinations:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" observation.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. If these two singlets have different chemical shifts, the combined spectrum will show **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. In a 1:1 mixture, the integration ratio is **1:1**. **This matches the aromatic data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This matches the aliphatic data.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" observation.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and the 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB give two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and the two 6H singlets from 1,2,3,4-TMB give three singlets in a 12:6:6 or 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Provided NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given from the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. This corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 4, consistent with a substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1. This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the total number of protons for each type is equal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1. This indicates three distinct types of alkyl protons (likely methyl groups since they are singlets), with their total proton counts in a 2:1:1 ratio. The chemical shift around 2.2 ppm is characteristic of methyl groups attached to a benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to determine the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, this signal will be a **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, which will be a **singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2-C5 axis.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are in different chemical environments. They are not coupled to each other (meta-relationship). They will produce **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since they are equivalent, they appear as a **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be split by the CH3 protons into a **quartet (4H)**, and the CH3 protons will be split by the CH2 protons into a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** The presence of a quartet and a triplet is inconsistent with the experimental data, which only shows singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which also eliminates option D.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the spectra of the remaining candidates in a 1:1 ratio to see which pair matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also gives one 2H singlet. Assuming they have slightly different chemical shifts, the combined spectrum will show **two singlets**. Since they both represent 2H and the mixture is 1:1, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. **This matches the experimental data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** (assuming they all have different chemical shifts). The integration ratio will be 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This also matches the experimental data.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the 1H NMR data provided.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This means there are two types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and they are present in equal amounts. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound contributes an equal number of protons to these two signals.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This indicates three distinct types of methyl groups in the mixture.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectra for each individual compound.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Low.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. They are meta to each other, so coupling is negligible, resulting in **two singlets** (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3, the one at C2, and the one at C5. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Moderate.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Because they are adjacent (ortho), they couple, but due to symmetry (an AA' system), they often appear as a single, sometimes broadened, signal. We will approximate this as **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or 1:1.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each gives a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3). This results in **one quartet** (4H) and **one triplet** (6H), not singlets.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the options based on a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Would show three singlets (one 2H signal from the first compound and two 1H signals from the second), with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Would show four singlets (one from the first compound, three from the second). This does not match the observed three singlets.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Would show three singlets (two 1H signals from the first compound, one 4H signal from the second). This does not match.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Would show three singlets, a quartet, and a triplet. This does not match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Would show three singlets (one 2H signal from the first compound, two 1H signals from the second). This does not match.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Would show up to five singlets (two from the first, three from the second). This does not match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** The first compound gives one 2H singlet. The second compound gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 2H, giving the observed **1:1 ratio**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** The first compound gives one singlet (12H). The second compound gives two singlets (6H each). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 mixture is the only option that perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided 1H NMR Spectrum Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the two aromatic signals must come from protons that are equal in number. For example, two different 2H signals, or two different 1H signals that happen to have a 1:1 ratio due to the mixture.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### Evaluating Each Compound's Expected 1H NMR Spectrum\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they appear as a single **singlet** representing 2 hydrogens (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** representing 12 hydrogens (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two non-equivalent aromatic protons at positions 4 and 6. Neither has an adjacent proton, so they appear as two distinct **singlets**, each representing 1 hydrogen (1H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in three **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent but are adjacent to each other. This ortho-coupling means they will split each other, appearing as a pair of doublets (an AB system), not singlets. This compound can be immediately ruled out as it does not produce singlets in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** It would show two singlets for the methyl groups (one for C1/C4 and one for C2/C3).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and appear as a single **singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The signals for the ethyl groups would be a quartet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CH3, not singlets. This compound can also be ruled out.\n\n### Analyzing the Mixture Options\n\nBased on the individual spectra, only 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene produce only singlets in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions (ignoring the splitting in prehnitene and diethylbenzene). Let's examine the mixture described in option B.\n\n**Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 mixture.**\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides two singlets (1H each).\n    *   The problem states there are only **two singlets in a 1:1 ratio**. This can happen if one of the 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has the same chemical shift as the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. This would result in one signal integrating to 3H (2H+1H) and the other integrating to 1H, giving a 3:1 ratio. This contradicts the given 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate. What if the two aromatic signals observed are the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and one of the aromatic protons from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, and the other proton from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is overlapping with one of the methyl signals? This is highly unlikely.\n    *   Let's reconsider the aromatic signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. They are two 1H singlets. And the signal from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene is one 2H singlet. For the mixture to show two aromatic signals in a 1:1 ratio, it implies that the total number of protons for each signal is the same. This would happen if the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are the signals observed, and the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene is coincidentally overlapping with one of them. This would lead to a 3:1 ratio.\n    *   There must be a misunderstanding of the problem or a simplification. Let's re-examine the aliphatic region, which is often more definitive.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three singlets (in a 6H:3H:3H ratio).\n    *   **Combined:** The spectrum is described as having three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This perfectly matches the signals from **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene alone**.\n    *   If the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, it should contribute a large 12H singlet. This would drastically alter the aliphatic region unless its signal overlaps perfectly with one of the signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   Let's assume the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene overlaps with the 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The total integration would be (12H+6H) : 3H : 3H, which is an 18:3:3 or 6:1:1 ratio. This does not match.\n        *   Let's assume the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene overlaps with one of the 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The total integration would be 6H : (12H+3H) : 3H, which is a 6:15:3 or 2:5:1 ratio. This does not match.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction in the problem statement as written. Let's reconsider the aromatic region. \"two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio\".\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the aliphatic ratio and re-evaluate the aromatic signals.\n*   **Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1 singlet (2H) from durene, 2 singlets (1H each) from isodurene.\n    *   If the 2H singlet from durene has a unique chemical shift, and the two 1H singlets from isodurene are also resolved, we would see three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   If the 2H singlet from durene overlaps with one of the 1H singlets from isodurene, we would see two signals with a 3:1 ratio.\n    *   If the two 1H singlets from isodurene have the same chemical shift (unlikely but possible), and this is different from the durene signal, we would see two signals with a 2H:2H or 1:1 ratio. Let's check if this is plausible. The two aromatic protons in isodurene are in slightly different environments, so their signals should be distinct.\n\nLet's reconsider the aliphatic region. \"three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\". This is the exact pattern for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups (6H:3H:3H). Where does the signal for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups (12H) go? For the overall ratio to be 2:1:1, the 12H signal must be hidden or overlapping in a very specific way.\n\nLet's reconsider the question and options. There might be a simpler interpretation.\n\n*   **Aromatic:** Two singlets, 1:1 ratio.\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two 1H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has one 2H signal (not a singlet).\n    *   If we mix **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**, we get a 2H singlet and a 2H non-singlet. This doesn't match.\n    *   If we mix **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**, we have a 2H singlet and two 1H singlets. This is three signals.\n    *   What if the question implies that the two compounds *together* create this pattern?\n\nLet's assume the two compounds are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n*   **Aromatic Protons:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (2H) at ~6.89 ppm.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB: 2 singlets (1H each).\n    *   The problem states two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This could mean the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB accidentally integrate to a 1:1 ratio. This is only possible if the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are coincidentally equivalent, giving a 2H singlet. Then we would have two 2H singlets, which is a 1:1 ratio. This is the most plausible explanation for the aromatic region.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (12H) at ~2.18 ppm.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB: 3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The problem states three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This is the exact pattern for the methyl groups of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This implies that the large 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene must be overlapping with one of the signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n    *   Let's assume the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB overlaps with the 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would give three signals with integrals of (12+6)H : 3H : 3H, which is an 18:3:3 or 6:1:1 ratio. This does not match the 2:1:1 ratio given.\n\nThere is a clear contradiction in the problem statement. However, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, one must often find the \"best fit\" even if the data is imperfectly described.\n\nLet's re-evaluate from the start, assuming there is a correct answer among the options.\n*   Options A and C are ruled out because 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene does not give an aromatic singlet.\n*   Option D is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene gives a quartet and a triplet, not singlets, for its alkyl protons.\n\nThis leaves only **Option B** as a possibility. Let's try to reconcile the data with this option.\n*   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:** The problem states three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This is the signature of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups (6H:3H:3H). For this to be the observed ratio in a 1:1 mixture, the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene must be accounted for. The only way the 2:1:1 ratio is preserved is if the 12H signal from 1,2,4,5-TMB overlaps with the 6H signal from 1,2,3,5-TMB, and the problem statement has a typo in the ratio. For instance, if the ratio was 6:1:1, it would fit. Given the provided 2:1:1 ratio, there is a strong contradiction.\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** The problem states two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets.\n    *   For these to result in two singlets with a 1:1 ratio, the most likely scenario (within the constraints of a flawed question) is that the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are coincidentally degenerate (have the same chemical shift), creating a single 2H singlet. This, combined with the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB, would give two 2H singlets, resulting in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Conclusion based on best fit:**\nDespite the contradictions in the data (particularly the aliphatic ratio), Option B is the only one that contains compounds that could plausibly create the described signals (all singlets). The other options include compounds that fundamentally do not match the signal splitting (non-singlets). Therefore, assuming there are errors in the problem's description of the ratios, Option B is the only chemically sound choice.\n\nFinal check:\n- Aromatic: Two 2H singlets (1:1 ratio) is plausible if the two 1H protons in 1,2,3,5-TMB are accidentally equivalent in the NMR.\n- Aliphatic: Three singlets (2:1:1 ratio). This is the pattern for 1,2,3,5-TMB. The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB is problematic. However, if we must choose the best option, B is the only one that doesn't violate fundamental splitting rules.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### 1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1, the total number of aromatic protons from each compound must be equal. Let's say each compound contributes 'x' protons to the aromatic region. The total integration would be 2x. The two signals having a 1:1 ratio means each signal corresponds to 'x' protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### 2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Option\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Low.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. This will produce **two separate singlets**, each for 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C5, the one at C2, and the two equivalent ones at C1 and C3. This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 3H:3H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1:2**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Moderate.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are adjacent (ortho-coupling). They will split each other, producing **two doublets**, not singlets.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: C1/C4 and C2/C3. This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. This will produce a **quartet** (4H, from the two -CH2- groups) and a **triplet** (6H, from the two -CH3 groups).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options Based on the Mixture's Spectrum\n\nNow, let's analyze the combined spectrum for a 1:1 mixture of each pair.\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets, each of 6H.\n    *   The combined spectrum would show **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data for the alkyl region.\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two doublets (1H each).\n    *   The problem states there are \"two singlets\" in a 1:1 ratio. This appears to be a contradiction. However, the alkyl region data is a perfect and unambiguous match. It is highly likely that the description of the aromatic region is slightly inaccurate in the problem statement. For instance, the two doublets from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene might be considered as one \"signal\" (a multiplet) integrating to 2H. This would result in two signals (one singlet, one multiplet) with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. Given the perfect fit of the alkyl data, this is the most plausible option.\n\n**B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:** This mixture would show three singlets (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) plus a quartet and a triplet (from 1,4-diethylbenzene). This does not match the observation of only three singlets.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The combined spectrum would have four singlets with a ratio of 12:6:3:3 (or 4:2:1:1). This does not match the observed 2:1:1 ratio unless there is an accidental overlap of the two 3H signals, which is an extra assumption.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** This mixture would show three singlets (one 2H and two 1H signals), which contradicts the \"two signals\" observation.\n\n**D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:** This mixture would produce at least five singlets (two from 1,2,3,4-TMB and three from 1,2,3,5-TMB), which is inconsistent with the data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data for the alkyl region (three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio) is uniquely and perfectly explained by the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Despite the conflicting description of the aromatic region signals as \"singlets,\" the strength of the evidence from the alkyl region makes this the only logical choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the information provided in the question.**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The mixture contains two compounds, both with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four candidate compounds.**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, a singlet, integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, a singlet, integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce two distinct signals. Since neither has an adjacent proton, they will both be singlets, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (a singlet for 6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (a singlet for 3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (a singlet for 3H).\n    *   This gives three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent but are adjacent to each other. They will couple and split each other's signals, resulting in a pair of doublets (an AX or AB system), not singlets.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** Two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3), giving two singlets, each for 6H.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic doublets, 2 aliphatic singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, giving one singlet for 4H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The CH2 protons will be a quartet (split by the CH3) and the CH3 protons will be a triplet (split by the CH2).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet, 1 aliphatic quartet, 1 aliphatic triplet.\n\n**Step 3: Use the process of elimination to find the correct pair of compounds.**\n\nThe problem states that all observed signals are **singlets**. This is a crucial piece of information.\n\n*   **Eliminate options with 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** Prehnitene produces aromatic **doublets**, not singlets. This rules out options A and D.\n    *   A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene -> **Incorrect**.\n    *   D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene -> **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Eliminate the option with 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound produces an aliphatic **quartet** and **triplet**. The problem specifies that all aliphatic signals are singlets. This rules out option C.\n    *   C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene -> **Incorrect**.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the remaining option.**\n\nBy elimination, the only possible answer is **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\nLet's verify how this mixture could produce the observed spectrum:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The mixture contains Durene (one 2H singlet) and Isodurene (two 1H singlets). The problem states there are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This can happen if the two 1H singlets of Isodurene are not resolved by the spectrometer and appear as a single 2H singlet. The spectrum would then show the 2H singlet from Durene and the unresolved 2H singlet from Isodurene, resulting in two signals with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The mixture contains Durene (one 12H singlet) and Isodurene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H). The problem states there are three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. The aliphatic signals of Isodurene alone perfectly match this description (6H:3H:3H = 2:1:1). The question is likely constructed such that the complex pattern of Isodurene is the identifying feature, and the signal from Durene is assumed to overlap with one of the other signals or the question is simplified. However, the elimination of all other options is definitive.\n\nBased on the strict criteria of signal splitting (singlets vs. other multiplets), option B is the only chemically sound choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to identify which pair of compounds from the given options, when mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Given NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1 molar ratio. This is crucial for comparing the integration of signals from the two different compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This means that in the 1:1 mixture, the total number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the total number of protons contributing to the second singlet.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This tells us about the relative number of methyl protons in different chemical environments.\n\n### **3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to determine the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and the integration for both the aromatic and aliphatic protons of each potential compound. This is done by analyzing the molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, it will be a **singlet**. Integration: **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, a **singlet**. Integration: 4 x 3H = **12H**.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent (ortho), equivalent protons do not split each other. They will produce a single **singlet**. Integration: **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives one **singlet**. Integration: 2 x 3H = **6H**.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent. This gives a second **singlet**. Integration: 2 x 3H = **6H**.\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A single plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent. They will produce two separate signals. Meta-coupling is usually too small to be resolved, so they will appear as two **singlets**. Integration: **1H each**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent. One **singlet**. Integration: **6H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique. A second **singlet**. Integration: **3H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique. A third **singlet**. Integration: **3H**.\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, like Durene.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four ring protons are chemically equivalent. They will produce one **singlet**. Integration: **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The two methylene (-CH2-) groups are equivalent. They are split by the adjacent methyl group protons into a **quartet**. Integration: **4H**.\n        *   The two methyl (-CH3) groups are equivalent. They are split by the adjacent methylene group protons into a **triplet**. Integration: **6H**.\n    *   **Summary for 1,4-diethylbenzene:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), 1 aliphatic triplet (6H).\n\n### **4. Evaluate Each Option Against the Mixture's Spectrum**\n\nNow, let's combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio and see which one matches the experimental data.\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio and each signal represents 2 protons, the integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. The mixture will show **three singlets** (assuming they have different chemical shifts). The integration ratio will be 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match.\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three signals (one 2H, two 1H), not two. This does not match.\n\n**C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three signals, not two. This does not match.\n\n**D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene) and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The spectrum for this mixture would contain singlets, a quartet, and a triplet. The problem states there are only three singlets in the aliphatic region. This does not match.\n\n### **5. Final Answer**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that correctly predicts the observed 1H NMR spectrum for the 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the predicted 1H NMR spectra for the candidate molecules and then combining them to match the experimental data for the mixture.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Given NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All four options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1. This is crucial because it means the integration values from each compound contribute equally to the total spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound must contribute one aromatic singlet, and these singlets must represent an equal number of protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds in the mixture.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe determine the number of unique proton environments in each molecule based on its symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 2 signals total.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C3 are equivalent (6H), C2 is unique (3H), and C5 is unique (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is **2:1:1**.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 4 signals total.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C4 are equivalent (6H) and C2/C3 are equivalent (6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is **1:1**.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 3 signals total.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has ethyl groups. The protons on the CH2 group will be split by the protons on the CH3 group, resulting in a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region. The problem states that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, this compound can be immediately ruled out, eliminating any option containing it.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Proposed Mixtures**\n\nWe will now combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in the options.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H and 6H). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with relative integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n    *   **This option is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the mixture has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This part is correct.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have a total of **four aliphatic singlets**. This contradicts the data, which states there are only three.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the mixture has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This part is correct.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H, 6H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo solve this problem, we need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the candidate molecules and then see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n**Experimental Data for the 1:1 Mixture:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Individual Compound**\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric, with two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

A 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets** with a **1:1** integration ratio (2H:2H). This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets.

This matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion: This is the correct mixture.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB has two singlets (6H, 6H). 1,2,3,5-TMB has three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one 6H signal overlaps), which does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** The integration ratio would be 2H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) to 4H (from 1,4-diethylbenzene), which is a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1. Also, 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB has one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,5-TMB has three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have a total of **four aliphatic singlets**, which does not match the observed three signals.\n\nTherefore, the only mixture that fits the NMR data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each option and see which one matches the provided data.\n\n**Given Spectral Data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **Analysis of Each Compound's Expected 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This results in a single signal, a **singlet**, for these 2 protons.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. This results in a single signal, a **singlet**, for all 12 protons.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 1 proton.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C5, the one at C2, and the equivalent pair at C1 and C3. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** for these 2 protons.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C4, and the pair at C2 and C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 6 protons (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, resulting in **one singlet** for 4 protons.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each ethyl group consists of a CH2 group and a CH3 group, which would appear as a **quartet and a triplet**, respectively, due to spin-spin splitting. This contradicts the problem description, which specifies only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### **Evaluating the Options**\n\nNow, let's analyze the 1:1 mixture for each option:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would produce three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal from the first compound and two 1H signals from the second), which does not match the two singlets observed.\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This combination would also result in three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal and two 1H signals), which is inconsistent with the data.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene would show a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides another 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** of equal integration, matching the **1:1 ratio** described.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets, each for 6H. The combination in the mixture gives three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This corresponds to a **2:1:1 ratio**, which perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo solve this problem, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound and then determine which 1:1 mixture would produce the observed spectrum.\n\n### Analysis of Individual Compounds\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Two singlets (1H each), as the two aromatic protons are in different chemical environments.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** Three singlets with an integration ratio of 6:3:3 (or 2:1:1).

This option can be immediately ruled out based on the alkyl signal description.\n\n### Analysis of the 1:1 Mixture\n\nThe experimental spectrum shows:\n*   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options for a 1:1 mixture:\n\n**A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   Aromatic: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the data provided for the 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that each compound contributes an aromatic signal and that these signals represent an equal number of protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. These three signals are the sum of all the methyl proton signals from both compounds in the mixture. The fact that they are all singlets is a key piece of information.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nTo find the correct pair, we must first predict the spectrum for each of the four candidate molecules by analyzing their symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a single plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

This compound can be immediately eliminated because the problem specifies that all aliphatic signals are singlets.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in each option to see which one matches the experimental data. We can eliminate any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is option C.\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce a single 2H aromatic singlet. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio (2H:2H). This means the aromatic data is consistent with options A, B, and D, and we must use the aliphatic data to find the correct answer.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:** We need to find a combination that results in three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would have **four** aliphatic singlets. This does not match.\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would have at least four aliphatic singlets (assuming one 6H signal overlaps). This does not match.\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n        *   The combined spectrum gives a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match with the experimental data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>"

(Formula OK)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent. They will appear as a **single singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show splitting: a quartet (4H) for the -CH2- groups and a triplet (6H) for the -CH3- groups. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be eliminated.\n\n**3. Identify the Correct Pair of Compounds**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can eliminate 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. The only two remaining candidates that fit the aromatic signal description (producing a singlet) are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\nLet's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds matches all the spectral data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes a 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes a 2H singlet.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, this will result in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   Let's consider the total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture: 12H from the first compound + 12H from the second = 24H total.\n    *   The observed ratio is 2:1:1. The sum of the ratio parts is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   The actual integration for the three signals will be:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Now let's see if our chosen pair can produce signals with these integrations:\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet of **12H**. This matches our largest signal.\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n        *   The 6H signal from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene can be our second signal.\n        *   For the third signal, we need an integration of 6H. This can be explained if the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene accidentally have the same chemical shift and overlap, appearing as a single 6H peak. This is a common feature in NMR problems.\n    *   Therefore, the combined spectrum would show three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H, which gives the required **2:1:1 ratio**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that matches all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture based on the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n### 1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This indicates that the two compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, and each compound has only one type of aromatic proton (all aromatic protons on a given molecule are chemically equivalent). The 1:1 ratio of the signals confirms the 1:1 molar ratio of the compounds, as long as each compound has the same number of aromatic protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. These signals represent the combined methyl (or other alkyl) protons from both compounds in the mixture. All signals are singlets, meaning there is no splitting, which is characteristic of methyl groups not adjacent to any protons.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Compound Option\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C2, the one at C5, and the two equivalent ones at C1 and C3. This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 3H:3H:6H (or 1:1:2).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the \"outer\" methyls (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" methyls (C2, C3). This will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H, giving a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, producing **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups, not just methyl groups. The spectrum would show a quartet (for the -CH2-) and a triplet (for the -CH3-), not just singlets. Therefore, this compound can be eliminated.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Mixture Options\n\nThe mixture must contain two compounds that each give a single peak in the aromatic region. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers fit this criterion. Since they each have 2 aromatic protons, a 1:1 mixture will correctly produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\nNow, we must find the combination whose alkyl signals add up to three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: Two singlets (6H, 6H) from 1,2,3,4-TMB and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would result in up to five signals, which does not match the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: One singlet (12H) from 1,2,4,5-TMB and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This gives a total of four signals, which only matches the data if there is an accidental overlap of signals. To get a 2:1:1 ratio (which corresponds to 12H:6H:6H), the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB would need to overlap, which is unlikely as they are in different chemical environments.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture gives two 2H singlets, which is a 1:1 ratio. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each).\n    *   **Combined alkyl signals:** The mixture will show three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   **Ratio:** The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data without needing to assume any accidental signal overlaps.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that perfectly accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem Statement:** First, we'll break down the information provided by the 1H NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n    *   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This implies the mixture contains two different compounds, and each compound contributes one aromatic singlet. Since the mixture is 1:1, the number of protons for each aromatic singlet must be the same.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This is the combined signal from the aliphatic protons of both compounds in the mixture.\n\n2.  **Analyze Individual Candidate Compounds:** We will predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four options to see what signals they would produce on their own. We'll focus on the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their relative integration (number of protons).\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it has one type of aromatic proton (2H) and one type of methyl group (12H). This gives 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** It has one plane of symmetry. This results in one type of aromatic proton (2H), and three different types of methyl groups (6H, 3H, 3H). This gives 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H, a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** It has one plane of symmetry. This results in one type of aromatic proton (2H) and two different types of methyl groups (6H, 6H). This gives 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H, a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups, which would produce quartets and triplets in the aliphatic region, not just singlets. Therefore, it can be eliminated from consideration.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Mixtures (Options A-D):** We will combine the predicted spectra for the pairs of compounds in each option (assuming a 1:1 mixture) and see which one matches the observed data.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** A 1:1 mixture of any two of the tetramethylbenzene isomers will produce two 2H aromatic singlets, matching the observed 1:1 ratio. So, we must use the aliphatic region to distinguish them.\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** We will sum the aliphatic signals for each pair and check if the result is three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation and Final Answer:** A Python script will be used to systematically perform the analysis described above and identify the correct option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes 1H NMR data for a mixture of two aromatic compounds to identify them.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the provided 1H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture.\")\n    print(\"  - Aromatic Region: 2 singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\")\n    print(\"  - Aliphatic Region: 3 singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the spectral characteristics of each candidate compound.\n    # The data is stored as: { \"aromatic_H\": count, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [list_of_H_counts] }\n    compounds = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 2, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [12]},\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 2, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [6, 3, 3]},\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 2, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [6, 6]},\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 4, \"aliphatic_integrations\": \"non-singlets\"}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Predicted 1H NMR signals for individual compounds.\")\n    for name, data in compounds.items():\n        print(f\"  - {name}:\")\n        if isinstance(data[\"aliphatic_integrations\"], list):\n            print(f\"    - Aromatic: 1 singlet ({data['aromatic_H']}H)\")\n            print(f\"    - Aliphatic: {len(data['aliphatic_integrations'])} singlet(s) with integrations {data['aliphatic_integrations']}H\")\n        else:\n            print(\"    - Aliphatic signals are not all singlets, so this compound is excluded.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 3: Define the options and evaluate them.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"B\": (\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\"),\n        \"C\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"D\": (\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\")\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Evaluating each option for a 1:1 mixture.\")\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, (name1, name2) in options.items():\n        print(f\"\\nTesting Option {option}: {name1} and {name2}\")\n        comp1 = compounds[name1]\n        comp2 = compounds[name2]\n\n        # Rule out any option with 1,4-diethylbenzene\n        if comp1[\"aliphatic_integrations\"] == \"non-singlets\" or comp2[\"aliphatic_integrations\"] == \"non-singlets\":\n            print(\"  - Result: FAILED.

The total number of carbons is 6 + 4 = 10. The total number of hydrogens is 2 + (4 * 3) = 14. The formula is C10H14. This applies to options 1, 2, and 3.\n*   **Diethylbenzene:** The formula is C6H4(C2H5)2. The total number of carbons is 6 + (2 * 2) = 10. The total number of hydrogens is 4 + (2 * 5) = 14. The formula is C10H14. This applies to option 4.\n*   **Conclusion:** All four compounds have the correct molecular formula.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of unique proton environments.\n\n*   **1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical. There are two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will appear as a **single singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 signals total (one 2H aromatic singlet, one 12H alkyl singlet).\n\n*   **2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Less symmetrical. There is one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will appear as **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 5 signals total (two 1H aromatic singlets, three alkyl singlets with 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **3. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent (ortho) to each other. While they would technically couple, in such a symmetrical environment (an AA' system), they often appear as a **single singlet** (or a narrow multiplet that looks like a singlet). The integration is **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct types of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 3 signals total (one 2H aromatic singlet, two 6H alkyl singlets).\n\n*   **4. 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent. They will appear as a **single singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The protons within the ethyl group are not.\n        *   The -CH2- protons will be a **quartet** (split by the -CH3) with an integration of **4H**.\n        *   The -CH3- protons will be a **triplet** (split by the -CH2-) with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 3 signals total (one aromatic singlet, one alkyl quartet, one alkyl triplet). This is immediately ruled out because the problem states all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Mixture Spectrum**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that produces the observed spectrum. We can eliminate any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene (Option C) because it would produce a quartet and a triplet. We are left with options A, B, and D.\n\nLet's test the remaining combinations:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" observation.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. If these two singlets have different chemical shifts, the combined spectrum will show **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. In a 1:1 mixture, the integration ratio is **1:1**. **This matches the aromatic data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This matches the aliphatic data.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" observation.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and the 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB give two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and the two 6H singlets from 1,2,3,4-TMB give three singlets in a 12:6:6 or 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Provided NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given from the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. This corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 4, consistent with a substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1. This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the total number of protons for each type is equal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1. This indicates three distinct types of alkyl protons (likely methyl groups since they are singlets), with their total proton counts in a 2:1:1 ratio. The chemical shift around 2.2 ppm is characteristic of methyl groups attached to a benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to determine the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, this signal will be a **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, which will be a **singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2-C5 axis.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are in different chemical environments. They are not coupled to each other (meta-relationship). They will produce **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since they are equivalent, they appear as a **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be split by the CH3 protons into a **quartet (4H)**, and the CH3 protons will be split by the CH2 protons into a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** The presence of a quartet and a triplet is inconsistent with the experimental data, which only shows singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which also eliminates option D.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the spectra of the remaining candidates in a 1:1 ratio to see which pair matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also gives one 2H singlet. Assuming they have slightly different chemical shifts, the combined spectrum will show **two singlets**. Since they both represent 2H and the mixture is 1:1, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. **This matches the experimental data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** (assuming they all have different chemical shifts). The integration ratio will be 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This also matches the experimental data.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the 1H NMR data provided.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This means there are two types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and they are present in equal amounts. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound contributes an equal number of protons to these two signals.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This indicates three distinct types of methyl groups in the mixture.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectra for each individual compound.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Low.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. They are meta to each other, so coupling is negligible, resulting in **two singlets** (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3, the one at C2, and the one at C5. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Moderate.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Because they are adjacent (ortho), they couple, but due to symmetry (an AA' system), they often appear as a single, sometimes broadened, signal. We will approximate this as **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or 1:1.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each gives a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3). This results in **one quartet** (4H) and **one triplet** (6H), not singlets.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the options based on a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Would show three singlets (one 2H signal from the first compound and two 1H signals from the second), with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Would show four singlets (one from the first compound, three from the second). This does not match the observed three singlets.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Would show three singlets (two 1H signals from the first compound, one 4H signal from the second). This does not match.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Would show three singlets, a quartet, and a triplet. This does not match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Would show three singlets (one 2H signal from the first compound, two 1H signals from the second). This does not match.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Would show up to five singlets (two from the first, three from the second). This does not match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** The first compound gives one 2H singlet. The second compound gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 2H, giving the observed **1:1 ratio**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** The first compound gives one singlet (12H). The second compound gives two singlets (6H each). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 mixture is the only option that perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided 1H NMR Spectrum Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the two aromatic signals must come from protons that are equal in number. For example, two different 2H signals, or two different 1H signals that happen to have a 1:1 ratio due to the mixture.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### Evaluating Each Compound's Expected 1H NMR Spectrum\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they appear as a single **singlet** representing 2 hydrogens (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** representing 12 hydrogens (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two non-equivalent aromatic protons at positions 4 and 6. Neither has an adjacent proton, so they appear as two distinct **singlets**, each representing 1 hydrogen (1H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in three **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent but are adjacent to each other. This ortho-coupling means they will split each other, appearing as a pair of doublets (an AB system), not singlets. This compound can be immediately ruled out as it does not produce singlets in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** It would show two singlets for the methyl groups (one for C1/C4 and one for C2/C3).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and appear as a single **singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The signals for the ethyl groups would be a quartet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CH3, not singlets. This compound can also be ruled out.\n\n### Analyzing the Mixture Options\n\nBased on the individual spectra, only 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene produce only singlets in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions (ignoring the splitting in prehnitene and diethylbenzene). Let's examine the mixture described in option B.\n\n**Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 mixture.**\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides two singlets (1H each).\n    *   The problem states there are only **two singlets in a 1:1 ratio**. This can happen if one of the 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has the same chemical shift as the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. This would result in one signal integrating to 3H (2H+1H) and the other integrating to 1H, giving a 3:1 ratio. This contradicts the given 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate. What if the two aromatic signals observed are the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and one of the aromatic protons from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, and the other proton from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is overlapping with one of the methyl signals? This is highly unlikely.\n    *   Let's reconsider the aromatic signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. They are two 1H singlets. And the signal from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene is one 2H singlet. For the mixture to show two aromatic signals in a 1:1 ratio, it implies that the total number of protons for each signal is the same. This would happen if the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are the signals observed, and the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene is coincidentally overlapping with one of them. This would lead to a 3:1 ratio.\n    *   There must be a misunderstanding of the problem or a simplification. Let's re-examine the aliphatic region, which is often more definitive.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three singlets (in a 6H:3H:3H ratio).\n    *   **Combined:** The spectrum is described as having three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This perfectly matches the signals from **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene alone**.\n    *   If the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, it should contribute a large 12H singlet. This would drastically alter the aliphatic region unless its signal overlaps perfectly with one of the signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   Let's assume the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene overlaps with the 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The total integration would be (12H+6H) : 3H : 3H, which is an 18:3:3 or 6:1:1 ratio. This does not match.\n        *   Let's assume the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene overlaps with one of the 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The total integration would be 6H : (12H+3H) : 3H, which is a 6:15:3 or 2:5:1 ratio. This does not match.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction in the problem statement as written. Let's reconsider the aromatic region. \"two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio\".\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the aliphatic ratio and re-evaluate the aromatic signals.\n*   **Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1 singlet (2H) from durene, 2 singlets (1H each) from isodurene.\n    *   If the 2H singlet from durene has a unique chemical shift, and the two 1H singlets from isodurene are also resolved, we would see three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   If the 2H singlet from durene overlaps with one of the 1H singlets from isodurene, we would see two signals with a 3:1 ratio.\n    *   If the two 1H singlets from isodurene have the same chemical shift (unlikely but possible), and this is different from the durene signal, we would see two signals with a 2H:2H or 1:1 ratio. Let's check if this is plausible. The two aromatic protons in isodurene are in slightly different environments, so their signals should be distinct.\n\nLet's reconsider the aliphatic region. \"three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\". This is the exact pattern for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups (6H:3H:3H). Where does the signal for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups (12H) go? For the overall ratio to be 2:1:1, the 12H signal must be hidden or overlapping in a very specific way.\n\nLet's reconsider the question and options. There might be a simpler interpretation.\n\n*   **Aromatic:** Two singlets, 1:1 ratio.\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two 1H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has one 2H signal (not a singlet).\n    *   If we mix **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**, we get a 2H singlet and a 2H non-singlet. This doesn't match.\n    *   If we mix **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**, we have a 2H singlet and two 1H singlets. This is three signals.\n    *   What if the question implies that the two compounds *together* create this pattern?\n\nLet's assume the two compounds are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n*   **Aromatic Protons:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (2H) at ~6.89 ppm.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB: 2 singlets (1H each).\n    *   The problem states two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This could mean the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB accidentally integrate to a 1:1 ratio. This is only possible if the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are coincidentally equivalent, giving a 2H singlet. Then we would have two 2H singlets, which is a 1:1 ratio. This is the most plausible explanation for the aromatic region.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (12H) at ~2.18 ppm.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB: 3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The problem states three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This is the exact pattern for the methyl groups of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This implies that the large 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene must be overlapping with one of the signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n    *   Let's assume the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB overlaps with the 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would give three signals with integrals of (12+6)H : 3H : 3H, which is an 18:3:3 or 6:1:1 ratio. This does not match the 2:1:1 ratio given.\n\nThere is a clear contradiction in the problem statement. However, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, one must often find the \"best fit\" even if the data is imperfectly described.\n\nLet's re-evaluate from the start, assuming there is a correct answer among the options.\n*   Options A and C are ruled out because 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene does not give an aromatic singlet.\n*   Option D is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene gives a quartet and a triplet, not singlets, for its alkyl protons.\n\nThis leaves only **Option B** as a possibility. Let's try to reconcile the data with this option.\n*   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:** The problem states three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This is the signature of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups (6H:3H:3H). For this to be the observed ratio in a 1:1 mixture, the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene must be accounted for. The only way the 2:1:1 ratio is preserved is if the 12H signal from 1,2,4,5-TMB overlaps with the 6H signal from 1,2,3,5-TMB, and the problem statement has a typo in the ratio. For instance, if the ratio was 6:1:1, it would fit. Given the provided 2:1:1 ratio, there is a strong contradiction.\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** The problem states two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets.\n    *   For these to result in two singlets with a 1:1 ratio, the most likely scenario (within the constraints of a flawed question) is that the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are coincidentally degenerate (have the same chemical shift), creating a single 2H singlet. This, combined with the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB, would give two 2H singlets, resulting in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Conclusion based on best fit:**\nDespite the contradictions in the data (particularly the aliphatic ratio), Option B is the only one that contains compounds that could plausibly create the described signals (all singlets). The other options include compounds that fundamentally do not match the signal splitting (non-singlets). Therefore, assuming there are errors in the problem's description of the ratios, Option B is the only chemically sound choice.\n\nFinal check:\n- Aromatic: Two 2H singlets (1:1 ratio) is plausible if the two 1H protons in 1,2,3,5-TMB are accidentally equivalent in the NMR.\n- Aliphatic: Three singlets (2:1:1 ratio). This is the pattern for 1,2,3,5-TMB. The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB is problematic. However, if we must choose the best option, B is the only one that doesn't violate fundamental splitting rules.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### 1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1, the total number of aromatic protons from each compound must be equal. Let's say each compound contributes 'x' protons to the aromatic region. The total integration would be 2x. The two signals having a 1:1 ratio means each signal corresponds to 'x' protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### 2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Option\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Low.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. This will produce **two separate singlets**, each for 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C5, the one at C2, and the two equivalent ones at C1 and C3. This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 3H:3H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1:2**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Moderate.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are adjacent (ortho-coupling). They will split each other, producing **two doublets**, not singlets.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: C1/C4 and C2/C3. This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. This will produce a **quartet** (4H, from the two -CH2- groups) and a **triplet** (6H, from the two -CH3 groups).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options Based on the Mixture's Spectrum\n\nNow, let's analyze the combined spectrum for a 1:1 mixture of each pair.\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets, each of 6H.\n    *   The combined spectrum would show **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data for the alkyl region.\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two doublets (1H each).\n    *   The problem states there are \"two singlets\" in a 1:1 ratio. This appears to be a contradiction. However, the alkyl region data is a perfect and unambiguous match. It is highly likely that the description of the aromatic region is slightly inaccurate in the problem statement. For instance, the two doublets from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene might be considered as one \"signal\" (a multiplet) integrating to 2H. This would result in two signals (one singlet, one multiplet) with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. Given the perfect fit of the alkyl data, this is the most plausible option.\n\n**B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:** This mixture would show three singlets (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) plus a quartet and a triplet (from 1,4-diethylbenzene). This does not match the observation of only three singlets.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The combined spectrum would have four singlets with a ratio of 12:6:3:3 (or 4:2:1:1). This does not match the observed 2:1:1 ratio unless there is an accidental overlap of the two 3H signals, which is an extra assumption.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** This mixture would show three singlets (one 2H and two 1H signals), which contradicts the \"two signals\" observation.\n\n**D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:** This mixture would produce at least five singlets (two from 1,2,3,4-TMB and three from 1,2,3,5-TMB), which is inconsistent with the data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data for the alkyl region (three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio) is uniquely and perfectly explained by the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Despite the conflicting description of the aromatic region signals as \"singlets,\" the strength of the evidence from the alkyl region makes this the only logical choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the information provided in the question.**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The mixture contains two compounds, both with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four candidate compounds.**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, a singlet, integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, a singlet, integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce two distinct signals. Since neither has an adjacent proton, they will both be singlets, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (a singlet for 6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (a singlet for 3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (a singlet for 3H).\n    *   This gives three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent but are adjacent to each other. They will couple and split each other's signals, resulting in a pair of doublets (an AX or AB system), not singlets.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** Two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3), giving two singlets, each for 6H.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic doublets, 2 aliphatic singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, giving one singlet for 4H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The CH2 protons will be a quartet (split by the CH3) and the CH3 protons will be a triplet (split by the CH2).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet, 1 aliphatic quartet, 1 aliphatic triplet.\n\n**Step 3: Use the process of elimination to find the correct pair of compounds.**\n\nThe problem states that all observed signals are **singlets**. This is a crucial piece of information.\n\n*   **Eliminate options with 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** Prehnitene produces aromatic **doublets**, not singlets. This rules out options A and D.\n    *   A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene -> **Incorrect**.\n    *   D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene -> **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Eliminate the option with 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound produces an aliphatic **quartet** and **triplet**. The problem specifies that all aliphatic signals are singlets. This rules out option C.\n    *   C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene -> **Incorrect**.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the remaining option.**\n\nBy elimination, the only possible answer is **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\nLet's verify how this mixture could produce the observed spectrum:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The mixture contains Durene (one 2H singlet) and Isodurene (two 1H singlets). The problem states there are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This can happen if the two 1H singlets of Isodurene are not resolved by the spectrometer and appear as a single 2H singlet. The spectrum would then show the 2H singlet from Durene and the unresolved 2H singlet from Isodurene, resulting in two signals with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The mixture contains Durene (one 12H singlet) and Isodurene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H). The problem states there are three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. The aliphatic signals of Isodurene alone perfectly match this description (6H:3H:3H = 2:1:1). The question is likely constructed such that the complex pattern of Isodurene is the identifying feature, and the signal from Durene is assumed to overlap with one of the other signals or the question is simplified. However, the elimination of all other options is definitive.\n\nBased on the strict criteria of signal splitting (singlets vs. other multiplets), option B is the only chemically sound choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to identify which pair of compounds from the given options, when mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Given NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1 molar ratio. This is crucial for comparing the integration of signals from the two different compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This means that in the 1:1 mixture, the total number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the total number of protons contributing to the second singlet.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This tells us about the relative number of methyl protons in different chemical environments.\n\n### **3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to determine the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and the integration for both the aromatic and aliphatic protons of each potential compound. This is done by analyzing the molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, it will be a **singlet**. Integration: **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, a **singlet**. Integration: 4 x 3H = **12H**.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent (ortho), equivalent protons do not split each other. They will produce a single **singlet**. Integration: **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives one **singlet**. Integration: 2 x 3H = **6H**.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent. This gives a second **singlet**. Integration: 2 x 3H = **6H**.\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A single plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent. They will produce two separate signals. Meta-coupling is usually too small to be resolved, so they will appear as two **singlets**. Integration: **1H each**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent. One **singlet**. Integration: **6H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique. A second **singlet**. Integration: **3H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique. A third **singlet**. Integration: **3H**.\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, like Durene.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four ring protons are chemically equivalent. They will produce one **singlet**. Integration: **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The two methylene (-CH2-) groups are equivalent. They are split by the adjacent methyl group protons into a **quartet**. Integration: **4H**.\n        *   The two methyl (-CH3) groups are equivalent. They are split by the adjacent methylene group protons into a **triplet**. Integration: **6H**.\n    *   **Summary for 1,4-diethylbenzene:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), 1 aliphatic triplet (6H).\n\n### **4. Evaluate Each Option Against the Mixture's Spectrum**\n\nNow, let's combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio and see which one matches the experimental data.\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio and each signal represents 2 protons, the integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. The mixture will show **three singlets** (assuming they have different chemical shifts). The integration ratio will be 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match.\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three signals (one 2H, two 1H), not two. This does not match.\n\n**C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three signals, not two. This does not match.\n\n**D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene) and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The spectrum for this mixture would contain singlets, a quartet, and a triplet. The problem states there are only three singlets in the aliphatic region. This does not match.\n\n### **5. Final Answer**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that correctly predicts the observed 1H NMR spectrum for the 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the predicted 1H NMR spectra for the candidate molecules and then combining them to match the experimental data for the mixture.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Given NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All four options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1. This is crucial because it means the integration values from each compound contribute equally to the total spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound must contribute one aromatic singlet, and these singlets must represent an equal number of protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds in the mixture.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe determine the number of unique proton environments in each molecule based on its symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 2 signals total.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C3 are equivalent (6H), C2 is unique (3H), and C5 is unique (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is **2:1:1**.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 4 signals total.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C4 are equivalent (6H) and C2/C3 are equivalent (6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is **1:1**.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 3 signals total.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has ethyl groups. The protons on the CH2 group will be split by the protons on the CH3 group, resulting in a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region. The problem states that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, this compound can be immediately ruled out, eliminating any option containing it.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Proposed Mixtures**\n\nWe will now combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in the options.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H and 6H). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with relative integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n    *   **This option is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the mixture has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This part is correct.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have a total of **four aliphatic singlets**. This contradicts the data, which states there are only three.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the mixture has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This part is correct.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H, 6H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo solve this problem, we need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the candidate molecules and then see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n**Experimental Data for the 1:1 Mixture:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Individual Compound**\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric, with two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

The combined spectrum would have a total of **four aliphatic singlets**, which does not match the observed three signals.\n\nTherefore, the only mixture that fits the NMR data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each option and see which one matches the provided data.\n\n**Given Spectral Data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **Analysis of Each Compound's Expected 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This results in a single signal, a **singlet**, for these 2 protons.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. This results in a single signal, a **singlet**, for all 12 protons.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 1 proton.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C5, the one at C2, and the equivalent pair at C1 and C3. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** for these 2 protons.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C4, and the pair at C2 and C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 6 protons (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, resulting in **one singlet** for 4 protons.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each ethyl group consists of a CH2 group and a CH3 group, which would appear as a **quartet and a triplet**, respectively, due to spin-spin splitting. This contradicts the problem description, which specifies only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### **Evaluating the Options**\n\nNow, let's analyze the 1:1 mixture for each option:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would produce three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal from the first compound and two 1H signals from the second), which does not match the two singlets observed.\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This combination would also result in three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal and two 1H signals), which is inconsistent with the data.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene would show a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides another 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** of equal integration, matching the **1:1 ratio** described.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets, each for 6H. The combination in the mixture gives three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This corresponds to a **2:1:1 ratio**, which perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo solve this problem, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound and then determine which 1:1 mixture would produce the observed spectrum.\n\n### Analysis of Individual Compounds\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Two singlets (1H each), as the two aromatic protons are in different chemical environments.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** Three singlets with an integration ratio of 6:3:3 (or 2:1:1). The methyl groups at positions 1 and 3 are equivalent (6H), while the methyl groups at positions 2 and 5 are unique (3H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (2H), as the two aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** Two singlets with an integration ratio of 6:6 (or 1:1). The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent (6H), and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are also equivalent to each other (6H).\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** This compound has a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** It would show a quartet (from the -CH2- groups) and a triplet (from the -CH3 groups), not just singlets. This option can be immediately ruled out based on the alkyl signal description.\n\n### Analysis of the 1:1 Mixture\n\nThe experimental spectrum shows:\n*   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options for a 1:1 mixture:\n\n**A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   Aromatic: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three aromatic singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio (assuming no overlap). This does not match.\n\n**B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   Alkyl: 1,4-diethylbenzene would show a quartet and a triplet. This does not match the \"all singlets\" description.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   Aromatic: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three aromatic singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio (assuming no overlap). This does not match.\n\n**D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet integrating to 2 protons.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one singlet integrating to 2 protons.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio** (2H:2H). This perfectly matches the description of the aromatic region.\n*   **Alkyl Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet for its 12 equivalent protons.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets, each for 6 protons.\n    *   In the 1:1 mixture, the total proton integration for the alkyl signals would be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to a **2:1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the description of the alkyl region.\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo solve this problem, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four compounds and then determine which 1:1 mixture would produce the observed spectrum.\n\n### Analysis of Individual Compounds\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons on the ring (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent.
