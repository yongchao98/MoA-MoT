    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Abundance Notation\n\nThe notation `[A/B]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element A to element B in a star, compared to the same ratio in the Sun. It is defined as:\n\n`[A/B] = log10( (nA/nB)_star ) - log10( (nA/nB)_sun )`\n\nWhere `nA` and `nB` are the number densities of elements A and B.\n\nA useful identity derived from this definition is `[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]`. Also, it follows that `[A/B] = -[B/A]`. The abundances of elements are typically measured relative to Hydrogen (H).\n\n### 2. Calculating the Silicon Abundance for Star_1\n\nWe are given the following for Star_1:\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`\n\nWe want to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, `[Si/H]_1`. Using the identity `[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]`:\n\n`[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Silicon Abundance for Star_2\n\nFor Star_2, we are given:\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`\n\nTo find `[Si/H]_2`, we can use the same identity. First, we need `[Si/Mg]_2`.\n\n`[Si/Mg]_2 = -[Mg/Si]_2 = -0.3`\n\nNow, we can calculate `[Si/H]_2`:\n\n`[Si/H]_2 = [Si/Mg]_2 + [Mg/H]_2`\n`[Si/H]_2 = -0.3 + 0 = -0.3`\n\n### 4. Determining the Ratio of Silicon Atoms\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars. This corresponds to the ratio of their silicon number densities, which can be expressed as the ratio of their abundances relative to hydrogen, `(nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`.\n\nFrom the definition of `[Si/H]`:\n`[Si/H] = log10( (nSi/nH)_star ) - log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )`\n\nThis can be rearranged to solve for the abundance in the star:\n`log10( (nSi/nH)_star ) = [Si/H] + log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )`\n`(nSi/nH)_star = 10^[Si/H] * (nSi/nH)_sun`\n\nNow we can write this for both stars:\n*   For Star_1: `(nSi/nH)_1 = 10^[Si/H]_1 * (nSi/nH)_sun = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nH)_sun`\n*   For Star_2: `(nSi/nH)_2 = 10^[Si/H]_2 * (nSi/nH)_sun = 10^-0.3 * (nSi/nH)_sun`\n\nThe ratio is:\n`Ratio = (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`\n`Ratio = (10^0.3 * (nSi/nH)_sun) / (10^-0.3 * (nSi/nH)_sun)`\n\nThe solar silicon abundance `(nSi/nH)_sun` cancels out:\n`Ratio = 10^0.3 / 10^-0.3 = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) = 10^0.6`\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nFinally, we calculate the value of 10^0.6:\n\n`10^0.6 â‰ˆ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The extraneous information such as stellar masses and the specific methods (LTE, EW) are not required for this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
