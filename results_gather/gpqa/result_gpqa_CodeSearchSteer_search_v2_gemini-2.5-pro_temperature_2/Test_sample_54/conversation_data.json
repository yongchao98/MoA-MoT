    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown organic compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal corresponds to a methyl group (3H) that is a singlet (s), meaning it has no adjacent protons. This is a classic signal for the methyl group of an acetate (-O-C(=O)-CH₃), which is present in all four possible compounds.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal represents a methyl group (3H) that is a doublet (d). This indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-). This pattern is consistent with a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (`CH₃-CH=`).\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is from a single proton (1H) in the alkene region (around 4.5-7.5 ppm). It is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one other proton. The key piece of information is the coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants for protons across a double bond are stereochemically dependent.\n    *   A **trans** arrangement typically shows a large coupling constant, usually in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n    *   A **cis** arrangement shows a smaller coupling constant, usually 6-12 Hz.\n    *   The observed J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a **trans** configuration.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal is from a single proton (1H), also in the alkene region. The multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   **Doublet (d):** It is coupled to one proton, which would be the other proton on the double bond (the one at 7.0 ppm).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** It is coupled to a group of three equivalent protons, which corresponds to the neighboring methyl group (the one at 1.6 ppm).\n\n### 2. Assembling the Structure:\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have an acetate group (`-OAc`).\n*   We have a `CH₃-CH=` group, which accounts for the signals at 1.6 ppm and a portion of the splitting for the 5.5 ppm signal.\n*   We have a `=-CH-OAc` proton, which is deshielded (further downfield at 7.0 ppm) due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom.\n*   The two protons on the double bond (`CH=CH`) are in a *trans* arrangement because of the 16.0 Hz coupling constant.\n\nThis information points to the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**:\n\n`CH₃(d, 1.6 ppm) - CH(dq, 5.5 ppm) = CH(d, 7.0 ppm) - O - C(=O) - CH₃(s, 2.1 ppm)`\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options:\n\n*   **Propenyl vs. Butenyl:** The total proton count from the data is 3H + 3H + 1H + 1H = 8 protons. Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂) has 8 protons, which matches the data. Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂) has 10 protons and would produce a more complex spectrum inconsistent with the data provided. Therefore, we can eliminate options C and D.\n*   **Cis vs. Trans:** The coupling constant of 16.0 Hz is definitive for a *trans* configuration. Cis-propenyl acetate would exhibit a smaller J-value (typically <12 Hz).\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
