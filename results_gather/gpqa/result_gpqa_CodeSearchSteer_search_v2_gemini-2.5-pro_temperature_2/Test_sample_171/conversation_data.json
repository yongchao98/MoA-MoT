    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct equation.\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics**: The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of two stars. The key principle to use here is the Boltzmann distribution, which is applicable because the problem states the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (level *j*) to a lower state (level *i*) is given by:\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n    where:\n    *   N_j, N_i are the populations of the levels.\n    *   g_j, g_i are the statistical weights of the levels (which we can assume are the same for the same transition in both stars).\n    *   ΔE = E_j - E_i is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.3806 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Set up the Equations for Both Stars**: Let's denote the ratio N_j/N_i as the \"excitation ratio\" (let's call it *X*).\n    *   For star 1 (temperature T₁): X₁ = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)], where C is the ratio of statistical weights (g_j/g_i).\n    *   For star 2 (temperature T₂): X₂ = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)].\n\n4.  **Use the Information from the Problem**: The problem states that iron atoms in star 1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star 2. This means the excitation ratio in star 1 is twice that in star 2:\n    X₁ = 2 * X₂\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations**:\n    C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] = 2 * C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\n    The constant C cancels out:\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\n6.  **Solve for the Relationship between T₁ and T₂**: To solve this, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n\n    Now, rearrange the terms to isolate ln(2):\n    ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2)\n\n    Factor out the common term (ΔE/k):\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n    (ΔE / k) * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)] = ln(2)\n\n7.  **Incorporate the Given Energy Value**: The problem states that the energy difference ΔE is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant *k* is also approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n    This is a strong hint that the problem intends for the ratio ΔE/k to be considered as 1. In physics problems, this is often done by assuming a system of natural units where k=1, or by choosing values specifically to allow for simplification. The value of ΔE/k is:\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K.\n\n    Looking at the options provided, none of them contain the ΔE/k term. This confirms that we should assume ΔE/k=1 for the purpose of finding the correct form of the equation. Setting ΔE/k = 1 simplifies the derived equation to:\n\n    ln(2) = (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)\n\nThis matches option A. A higher excitation in star 1 implies T₁ > T₂, which is consistent with the derived equation since ln(2) is positive.\n\n<<<A>>>"
