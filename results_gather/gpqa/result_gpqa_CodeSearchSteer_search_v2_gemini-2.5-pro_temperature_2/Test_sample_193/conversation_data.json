    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, leading to a total of 2^3 = 8 possible microstates. The energy of the system is given by the equation E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible configurations:\n\n*   **State 1: All spins up**\n    (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n*   **State 2: All spins down**\n    (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nThese two states have the same energy, E₁ = -3J, so this energy level has a degeneracy (g₁) of 2.\n\n*   **State 3: One spin down, two spins up**\n    There are three such configurations: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), and (-1, +1, +1).\n    For the configuration (+1, +1, -1):\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    The other two configurations in this group also have the same energy.\n\n*   **State 4: One spin up, two spins down**\n    There are three such configurations: (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n    For the configuration (+1, -1, -1):\n    E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n    The other two configurations in this group also result in the same energy.\n\nThe six states with one spin flipped relative to the other two all have the same energy, E₂ = J. Therefore, this energy level has a degeneracy (g₂) of 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all states, which can be grouped by their energy levels:\nZ = Σᵢ gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\n\nSubstituting the calculated energies and their degeneracies:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\nB) Z= 2e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\nC) Z= 2e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\nD) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\n\nThe calculated partition function matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
