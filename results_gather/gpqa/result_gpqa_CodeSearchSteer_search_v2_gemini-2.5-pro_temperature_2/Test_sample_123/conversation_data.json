    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, to the process of particle decay.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1.  **Particle Decay**: The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after a time `t` in their own rest frame is described by the exponential decay law: `N = N₀ * e^(-t/τ₀)`, where `τ₀` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n2.  **Time Dilation**: For an observer in the laboratory frame, the lifetime of a fast-moving particle appears to be longer due to time dilation. This dilated lifetime, `τ`, is related to the proper lifetime `τ₀` by the Lorentz factor `γ` (gamma): `τ = γ * τ₀`.\n3.  **Travel Time**: The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light, `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\nFirst, we establish the formula for the fraction of particles reaching the detector. The decay process observed in the lab frame uses the dilated lifetime `τ = γτ₀` and the travel time in the lab `t_lab = R/c`.\n\nThe fraction of surviving particles is:\n`N/N₀ = e^(-t_lab / τ) = e^(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\nThe term `R / (c * τ₀)` contains the constants for this specific experiment and particle type. Let's call this constant `K`. So, the formula becomes `N/N₀ = e^(-K / γ)`.\n\n**Scenario 1: One-third of particles reach the detector**\n\nWe are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁` is 20, one-third (1/3) of the particles reach the wall.\n\n`1/3 = e^(-K / 20)`\n\nTo find the constant `K`, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2: Two-thirds of particles reach the detector**\n\nWe need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, required for two-thirds (2/3) of the particles to survive.\n\n`2/3 = e^(-K / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n`ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`\n\nNow we can solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\nSubstitute the expression for `K` from Scenario 1 into this equation:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.185`\n\nThis calculated value is very close to 54. A higher Lorentz factor results in greater time dilation, allowing a larger fraction of particles to survive the journey to the detector wall.\n\n<<<C>>>"
