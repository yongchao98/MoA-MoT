    "The question describes a nuclear decay analogous to double-beta decay and asks how the energy spectrum of the emitted electrons (particles E) changes when the accompanying light particles are altered.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the comparison:\n\n### Original Decay: 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V\n\nThis process is a \"many-body\" decay because the total available energy (the Q-value) is shared among the final products: the two B nuclei, the two E particles, and the two V particles.\n\n*   **Spectrum:** Because the two V particles (analogous to neutrinos) can carry away a variable amount of energy, the portion of energy left for the two E particles also varies. This results in a continuous energy spectrum for the summed energy of the two E particles.\n*   **Endpoint (Q):** The spectrum has a maximum energy, or endpoint, which corresponds to the scenario where the V particles carry away zero kinetic energy. The endpoint Q is determined by the total energy released, which depends on the masses of the initial and final particles: Q = Mass(2A) - Mass(2B) - Mass(2E) - Mass(2V).\n\n### Variant Decay: 2A -> 2B + 2E + M\n\nIn this variant, the two massive V particles are replaced by a single, exotic, *massless* particle M (analogous to a Majoron).\n\n*   **Spectrum:** The decay still results in multiple bodies in the final state (2B, 2E, and M). The available energy is shared among them. Since the massless particle M can carry away a variable amount of energy, the summed energy of the two E particles will still be continuous. Therefore, options A and B, which suggest a discrete spectrum, are incorrect.\n*   **Shape:** While the spectrum remains continuous, its precise shape changes. This is because the distribution of energy among the final particles (the \"phase space\") is different for a three-body decay (2E, M, and the recoiling 2B nucleus) compared to a five-body decay (2E, 2V, and 2B). Majoron-emitting decay spectra are typically \"peaked\" at higher energies than their two-neutrino counterparts.\n*   **Endpoint (Q'):** The new endpoint Q' is calculated similarly: Q' = Mass(2A) - Mass(2B) - Mass(2E) - Mass(M).\n*   **Comparison:** Since the particle M is massless (Mass(M) = 0) and the original V particles had mass (Mass(2V) > 0), less energy is converted into rest mass in the variant decay. The energy that would have created the mass of the two V particles is now available as kinetic energy for the final particles.\n    Therefore, Q' > Q. The endpoint of the energy spectrum increases.\n\nCombining these points, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\n<<<C>>>"
