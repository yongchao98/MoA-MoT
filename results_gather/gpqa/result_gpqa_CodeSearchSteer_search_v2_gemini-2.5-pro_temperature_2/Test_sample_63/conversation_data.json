    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Experimental Data**\n\nThe problem provides data from a sequential gas analysis setup. Let's interpret the results from each tube:\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent. Its mass increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The problem states its weight did not change, meaning no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form solid copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of the tube (0.80 g) is due to the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **2. Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nThe most common gas that would not react with a drying agent, a basic solution, or hot copper is nitrogen (N₂). Let's verify this by checking if the total mass of the products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of Gas C (assuming it's N₂): 0.10 mol * 28 g/mol = **2.80 g**.\n*   Total mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(N₂)\n*   Total mass = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = **7.20 g**.\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly, confirming the products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂.\n\n### **3. Determine the Reactants (Salts A and B)**\n\nThe original salts decomposed to form water, oxygen, and nitrogen. This indicates the salts must contain nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. The fact that they decompose completely into gases suggests they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxyanions.\n\nLet's consider two common salts that fit this description: ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (at higher temperatures): 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture of salts A and B was **equimolar**. Let's assume the mixture contains 'n' moles of Salt A (NH₄NO₂) and 'n' moles of Salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe total moles of products would be:\n*   **From 'n' mol of NH₄NO₂:**  n mol N₂ + 2n mol H₂O\n*   **From 'n' mol of NH₄NO₃:**  n mol N₂ + 0.5n mol O₂ + 2n mol H₂O\n    (This is derived by halving the balanced equation `2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O` to correspond to 'n' moles)\n\nAdding the products from both reactions:\n*   **Total N₂:** n + n = **2n**\n*   **Total H₂O:** 2n + 2n = **4n**\n*   **Total O₂:** 0 + 0.5n = **0.5n**\n\nNow, let's compare the mole ratio from our hypothesis (2n : 4n : 0.5n, which simplifies to **4 : 8 : 1**) with the experimental mole ratio.\n*   **Experimental moles:** 0.10 mol N₂ : 0.20 mol H₂O : 0.025 mol O₂\n*   **Experimental ratio:** Dividing by the smallest value (0.025) gives **4 : 8 : 1**.\n\nThe ratios match perfectly. This confirms that salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nNow we can identify the two salts:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrite, formula **NH₄NO₂**\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrate, formula **NH₄NO₃**\n\nThe question asks for the **total number of all atoms in salts A and B**. This means summing the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Atoms in NH₄NO₂:** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms\n*   **Atoms in NH₄NO₃:** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms\n\n**Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17**\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<C>>>"
