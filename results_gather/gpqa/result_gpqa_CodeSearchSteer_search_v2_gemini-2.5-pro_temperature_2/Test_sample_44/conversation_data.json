    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the energies for the ground state and the first two excited states of the system.\n\n**1. System Description**\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. These are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy for a single particle in this well is quantized and given by the formula:\n    E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²) = n² * E\n    where n is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** No two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Since the particles have spin-1/2, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**2. Ground State Energy**\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   The lowest energy level is n=1 (energy E₁ = 1²E = E). It can hold two fermions.\n*   The next energy level is n=2 (energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E). It can also hold two fermions.\n*   Thus, the ground state configuration is two particles in the n=1 level and two particles in the n=2 level.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂)\nE_ground = (2 × E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**3. First Excited State Energy**\nTo find the first excited state, we must promote one particle from the ground state configuration to the lowest available energy level. This corresponds to moving a particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   The new configuration will have two particles in the n=1 level, one particle in the n=2 level, and one particle in the n=3 level.\n*   The energy of the n=3 level is E₃ = 3²E = 9E.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\nE_first = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**4. Second Excited State Energy**\nTo find the second excited state, we need to find the next possible configuration with the lowest energy above the first excited state. There are a few possibilities to consider starting from the ground state:\n*   **Option A:** Promote a particle from the n=1 level to the n=3 level. The configuration would be: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Option B:** Promote both particles from the n=2 level to the n=3 level. The configuration would be: two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n*   **Option C:** Promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=4 level. The configuration would be: two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4 (E₄ = 4²E = 16E).\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\nComparing the energies (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest energy above the first excited state is 18E. Therefore, this is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
