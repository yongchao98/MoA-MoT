    "To determine the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the total electrostatic potential energy. The system consists of 13 identical particles, each with a charge `q = 2e`. One particle is fixed at a point P, and the other 12 particles are constrained to be on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2` m, centered at P.\n\nThe total potential energy `U_total` of this system is the sum of two components:\n1.  **`U_interaction_center`**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  **`U_interaction_sphere`**: The potential energy from the mutual repulsion of the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n### Calculation of `U_interaction_center`\n\nThe potential energy between the central charge `q` and any single charge `q` on the sphere is given by Coulomb's law:\n`U_pair = k * q^2 / R`\nwhere:\n*   `q = 2e` is the charge of each particle.\n*   `e ≈ 1.6021766 × 10^-19` C is the elementary charge.\n*   `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m²/C²` is Coulomb's constant.\n*   `R = 2` m is the distance from the center to each of the 12 charges.\n\nSince there are 12 such particles on the sphere, the total interaction energy with the central particle is:\n`U_interaction_center = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\n### Calculation of `U_interaction_sphere`\n\nThe 12 charges on the surface of the sphere will arrange themselves to minimize their mutual potential energy. This is a well-known problem in physics called the Thomson problem. For N=12 particles, the minimum energy configuration corresponds to the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy for this subsystem is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of the 12 charges:\n`U_interaction_sphere = Σ_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ 12} (k * q^2 / r_ij)`\nwhere `r_ij` is the distance between the i-th and j-th particles on the sphere.\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n`U_interaction_sphere = (k * q^2 / R) * S_12`\nwhere `S_12` is the dimensionless sum of the inverse distances between the vertices of an icosahedron inscribed in a unit sphere (`R=1`). The value of `S_12` for the icosahedral configuration is a known numerical result:\n`S_12 ≈ 49.165398`\n\n### Total Energy Calculation\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two components:\n`U_total = U_interaction_center + U_interaction_sphere`\n`U_total = 12 * (k * q^2 / R) + (k * q^2 / R) * S_12`\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (12 + S_12)`\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n*   `q = 2 * (1.6021766 × 10^-19 C) = 3.2043532 × 10^-19 C`\n*   `q^2 ≈ 1.0267878 × 10^-37 C²`\n*   `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m²/C²`\n*   `R = 2 m`\n*   `S_12 ≈ 49.165398`\n\nFirst, calculate the energy factor `(k * q^2 / R)`:\n`(k * q^2 / R) = ( (8.98755 × 10^9) * (1.0267878 × 10^-37) ) / 2`\n`(k * q^2 / R) ≈ (9.22858 × 10^-28) / 2 ≈ 4.61429 × 10^-28 J`\n\nNow, calculate the total energy:\n`U_total = (4.61429 × 10^-28 J) * (12 + 49.165398)`\n`U_total = (4.61429 × 10^-28 J) * (61.165398)`\n`U_total ≈ 2.82269 × 10^-26 J`\n\nRounding the result to three decimal places gives `2.823 × 10^-26 J`. This value is extremely close to option D. The minor difference can be attributed to the precision of the physical constants used.\n\n`2.82269 × 10^-26 J` is best represented by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
