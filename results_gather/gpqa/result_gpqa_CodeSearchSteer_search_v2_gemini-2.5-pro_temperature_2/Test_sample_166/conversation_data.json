    "### Calculation of Non-Gaussianity in a Schrödinger Cat State\n\nThe measure of non-Gaussianity (nG) for a quantum state, described by the density matrix ρ, is calculated using the relative entropy compared to a reference Gaussian state, τ. The formula is given by:\n\nnG = S(τ) - S(ρ)\n\nHere, S represents the von Neumann entropy, S(ρ) = -Tr(ρ ln ρ). The reference Gaussian state τ is defined as a Gaussian state having the same first and second moments (mean displacement and covariance matrix) as the state ρ.\n\nThe specific state in question is a Schrödinger cat state:\n|ψ⟩ = (cos(φ)|α⟩ + sin(φ)|-α⟩) / N\nwith φ = -π/4 and α = 0.5.\n\n**1. Entropy of the Initial State S(ρ):**\nThe state |ψ⟩ is a pure quantum state. The density matrix is ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. The von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero.\nTherefore, S(ρ) = 0.\n\nThis simplifies the non-Gaussianity calculation to nG = S(τ).\n\n**2. Determining the Reference Gaussian State τ:**\nTo find the entropy of τ, we must first characterize it by calculating the first and second moments of the state ρ. These moments are expressed in terms of the annihilation (a) and creation (a†) operators.\n\n*   **First Moment (Mean Displacement):** The mean amplitude `⟨a⟩` is calculated for the state ρ. Due to the symmetry of the odd cat state for φ = -π/4, the mean displacement is zero.\n    ⟨a⟩ = 0.\n\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance Matrix):** The reference state τ is characterized by the mean photon number `⟨n⟩ = ⟨a†a⟩` and the complex amplitude `⟨a²⟩`. For the given state `|ψ>`, which is an eigenstate of the operator a², the value of `⟨a²⟩` is `α²`.\n    *   ⟨a²⟩ = α² = (0.5)² = 0.25\n\n    The mean photon number for this specific cat state is given by the formula:\n    ⟨n⟩ = α² * (1 + exp(-2α²)) / (1 - exp(-2α²))\n\n    Plugging in α = 0.5:\n    ⟨n⟩ = (0.5)² * (1 + exp(-2 * 0.25)) / (1 - exp(-2 * 0.25))\n    ⟨n⟩ = 0.25 * (1 + exp(-0.5)) / (1 - exp(-0.5))\n    Using exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065:\n    ⟨n⟩ ≈ 0.25 * (1.6065 / 0.3935) ≈ 1.02065\n\n**3. Entropy of the Reference Gaussian State S(τ):**\nThe state τ is a centered (`⟨a⟩`=0) Gaussian state, but because `⟨a²⟩` is not zero, it is not a simple thermal state but a squeezed thermal state. The entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by the determinant of its covariance matrix (V). The determinant is related to the calculated moments by:\n\ndet(V) = (⟨n⟩ + 1/2)² - |⟨a²⟩|²\n\nUsing our calculated values:\ndet(V) ≈ (1.02065 + 0.5)² - |0.25|²\ndet(V) ≈ (1.52065)² - 0.0625\ndet(V) ≈ 2.3124 - 0.0625 = 2.2499\n\nThe von Neumann entropy of this Gaussian state is given by the formula:\nS(τ) = (x + 1/2) * ln(x + 1/2) - (x - 1/2) * ln(x - 1/2)\nwhere x = √det(V).\n\nx ≈ √2.2499 ≈ 1.5\n\nNow, calculating the entropy:\nS(τ) ≈ (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)\nS(τ) ≈ 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)\nSince ln(1) = 0 and ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\nS(τ) ≈ 2 * 0.693 = 1.386\n\n**4. Final Result:**\nThe amount of non-Gaussianity is:\nnG = S(τ) ≈ 1.386\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
