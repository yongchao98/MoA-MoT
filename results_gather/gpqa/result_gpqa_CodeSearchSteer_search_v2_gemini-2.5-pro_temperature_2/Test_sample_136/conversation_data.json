    "The final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n1.  **Understand the Energy Gain in a Synchrocyclotron:** A synchrocyclotron accelerates particles by applying an alternating voltage across one or two D-shaped electrodes (Dees). A particle gains energy each time it crosses the gap between the Dees. The problem states there are two accelerations per revolution.\n\n2.  **Principle of Phase Stability:** For the particle to be accelerated continuously, it must arrive at the gap at a specific phase of the alternating voltage, known as the synchronous phase ($Φ_s$). This ensures that even with slight variations in its trajectory or energy, the particle remains in sync with the accelerating field. The energy gained per crossing is not necessarily maximal, but is stable.\n\n3.  **Energy Gain per Revolution:** The energy gained by the proton at each crossing is given by $ΔT_{crossing} = q \\cdot U_{crossing}$, where $q$ is the proton's charge (equal to the elementary charge, *e*) and $U_{crossing}$ is the instantaneous voltage at the moment of crossing.\n    The voltage is given by $U(t) = U_0 \\cos(\\dots)$. At the synchronous phase $Φ_s$, the effective voltage is $U_0 \\cos(Φ_s)$.\n    Since there are two accelerations per revolution, the total energy gain per revolution is:\n    $ΔT_{rev} = 2 \\cdot (e \\cdot U_0 \\cdot \\cos(Φ_s))$\n\n4.  **Identify the Given Parameters:**\n    *   Final kinetic energy to be reached, $T_{final} = 950 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Initial kinetic energy, $T_{initial} \\simeq 0$\n    *   Peak voltage, $U_0 = 190 \\text{ kV} = 190 \\times 10^3 \\text{ V}$\n    *   The charge of the proton gives the energy unit electron-volt (eV), so for a single charge *e* crossing a potential of 190 kV, the energy gain in electron-volts is $e \\cdot U_0 = 190 \\text{ keV} = 0.190 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   The problem provides an initial phase in the voltage formula, $Φ_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$. In the context of a synchrocyclotron, stable acceleration requires a non-zero synchronous phase. Therefore, it is logical to assume that this given phase is the synchronous phase, so $Φ_s = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Gain per Revolution:**\n    Using the formula from step 3:\n    $ΔT_{rev} = 2 \\cdot (0.190 \\text{ MeV}) \\cdot \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4})$\n    We know that $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n    $ΔT_{rev} = 2 \\cdot 0.190 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\text{ MeV} = \\frac{0.380}{\\sqrt{2}} \\text{ MeV}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Number of Revolutions:**\n    The total number of revolutions, *N*, is the total energy gained divided by the energy gained per revolution.\n    $N = \\frac{T_{final}}{ΔT_{rev}}$\n    $N = \\frac{950 \\text{ MeV}}{\\frac{0.380}{\\sqrt{2}} \\text{ MeV}}$\n    $N = \\frac{950 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}}{0.380}$\n    Using the approximation $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.4142$:\n    $N \\approx \\frac{950 \\cdot 1.4142}{0.380} \\approx \\frac{1343.49}{0.380}$\n    $N \\approx 3535.5$\n\n7.  **Select the Closest Answer:**\n    The calculated number of revolutions is approximately 3535.5. The closest integer option is 3536.\n\n<<<C>>>"
