    "The search results confirm my derivation.\n\nSeveral sources confirm the process:\n1.  Kepler's Third Law is the fundamental principle used to determine the total mass of a binary system.\n2.  For a spectroscopic binary, the observable quantities are the period (P) and the radial velocities (K1 and K2).\n3.  The semi-major axes of the individual orbits (a1, a2) can be calculated from the velocities and the period using the formula for circular motion: `a = (v * P) / (2 * pi)`. For an observed spectroscopic binary, the peak radial velocity (K) is used, so `a * sin(i) = (K * P) / (2 * pi)`, where 'i' is the orbital inclination.\n4.  The problem states that both systems are eclipsing binaries. This is a critical piece of information, as it means the orbital plane is seen edge-on, so the inclination `i` is approximately 90 degrees. In this case, `sin(i)` is approximately 1, and the observed peak radial velocity `K` is equal to the true orbital velocity `v`.\n5.  Kepler's Third Law in its full form is `M1 + M2 = (4 * pi^2 / G) * a^3 / P^2`, where `a` is the semi-major axis of the relative orbit (`a = a1 + a2`).\n6.  By substituting `a = a1 + a2 = (P / (2 * pi)) * (K1 + K2)`, we get the total mass `M_total = (P / (2 * pi * G)) * (K1 + K2)^3`.\n\nThis confirms that the total mass of an eclipsing, double-lined spectroscopic binary system is directly proportional to its period and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes.\n\n`M_total ∝ P * (K_sum)^3`\n\nNow I will proceed with the calculation as planned.\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of RV amplitudes (K1_sum) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of RV amplitudes (K2_sum) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nThe ratio of the masses is:\nMass Ratio = M_system1 / M_system2 = [P1 * (K1_sum)^3] / [P2 * (K2_sum)^3]\nMass Ratio = [2 * (15)^3] / [1 * (25)^3]\nMass Ratio = 2 * (15/25)^3\nMass Ratio = 2 * (3/5)^3\nMass Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125)\nMass Ratio = 54 / 125\nMass Ratio = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.6\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\nTo determine the mass of a binary star system where both stars' radial velocities can be measured (a double-lined spectroscopic binary), we can use a derivative of Kepler's Third Law. The total mass of the system (M) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂).\n\nFor an eclipsing binary, we can assume the orbital inclination is close to 90 degrees, which simplifies the equations. The total mass (M = M₁ + M₂) of such a system can be expressed as:\n\nM ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)^3\n\nThis means the total mass is proportional to the orbital period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the necessary values for each system:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum₁): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum₂): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the mass of system 1 to the mass of system 2 (M₁/M₂):\n\n(M_system₁) / (M_system₂) = [P₁ * (K_sum₁)^3] / [P₂ * (K_sum₂)^3]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n(M_system₁) / (M_system₂) = [2 * (15)^3] / [1 * (25)^3]\n\n(M_system₁) / (M_system₂) = 2 * (15 / 25)^3\n\n(M_system₁) / (M_system₂) = 2 * (3 / 5)^3\n\n(M_system₁) / (M_system₂) = 2 * (27 / 125)\n\n(M_system₁) / (M_system₂) = 54 / 125\n\n(M_system₁) / (M_system₂) = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor by which system 1 is more massive than system 2 is 0.432. This value is closest to the option ~ 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
