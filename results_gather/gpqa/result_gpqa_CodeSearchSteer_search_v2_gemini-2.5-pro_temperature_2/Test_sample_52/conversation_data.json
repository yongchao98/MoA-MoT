    "The user wants me to identify the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided Data:\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a C6H4 core structure.\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** This means the molecule contains a -COO- functional group.\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Six signals total.**\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** This is consistent with a di-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** The \"doublet of quartets\" is a key piece of information. It means one vinyl proton is coupled to another vinyl proton (creating the doublet) and also to a set of three equivalent protons (the quartet), which must be a methyl group. The other vinyl proton, being a \"doublet,\" is only coupled to the first vinyl proton. This pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment accounts for one of the vinyl signals, one of the methyl signals, and has the formula C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups:** One of these is the methyl group in the propenyl fragment. The other -CH3 signal must belong to the ester functionality.\n    *   **No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups:** This confirms the absence of groups like ethyl (-CH2CH3) or propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), and validates the propenyl structure (-CH=CH-CH3) which has no -CH2- unit.\n\n### Deducing the Structure:\n*   We have a di-substituted benzene ring (**C6H4**).\n*   One substituent is a propenyl group (**C3H5**). This accounts for two vinyl-H signals and one -CH3 signal.\n*   The other substituent is an ester that also contains the second -CH3 group. The simplest such structures that do not contain a -CH2- group are a methyl ester group attached to the ring (**-COOCH3**) or an acetoxy group attached to the ring (**-OCOCH3**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n### Calculating the Molecular Formula:\nNow, we can sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the total molecular formula:\n*   **Aromatic ring:** C6H4\n*   **Propenyl group:** C3H5\n*   **Ester/Acetyl group:** C2H3O2\n\n**Total Calculation:**\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester/acetyl) = 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester/acetyl) = 12\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester/acetyl) = 2\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\nThis deduction is supported by a database entry for 4-Allylphenyl acetate (also known as 4-(2-Propenyl)phenyl acetate), which lists its molecular formula as C11H12O2. While this specific isomer might have slightly different NMR signals than described (allyl vs. propenyl), the constituent atoms are the same and it confirms a plausible structure for this formula. The described NMR is more consistent with a propenyl (-CH=CH-CH3) group, likely as one of its E/Z isomers, rather than an allyl group (-CH2-CH=CH2), as the latter would contain a -CH2- group, which is explicitly ruled out. For example, the molecule methyl 4-(1-propenyl)benzoate would fit the spectral data and has the formula C11H12O2.\n\nComparing the calculated formula with the given options:\nA) C12H12O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
