    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance the particle $X^0$ travels before it decays in the bubble chamber's frame of reference. This requires using principles of special relativity.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)\nThe Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, relates the time and space measurements of a moving object to those in its own rest frame. It's calculated from the particle's total energy (E) and its rest mass energy ($mc^2$). A critical step in interpretation is whether the given 27 GeV is the total energy or the kinetic energy. Given the context of particle physics problems, it is most plausible that the required resolution is the mean decay length of the particle, which becomes calculable if the energy given is interpreted as kinetic energy. Let's proceed with this interpretation.\n\n*   Kinetic Energy ($E_k$): 27 GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy ($mc^2$): 3.41 GeV\n*   Total Energy (E) is the sum of kinetic and rest mass energy:\n    $E = E_k + mc^2 = 27 \\text{ GeV} + 3.41 \\text{ GeV} = 30.41 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   The Lorentz factor is the ratio of total energy to rest mass energy:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{mc^2} = \\frac{30.41}{3.41} \\approx 8.918$\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Mean Lifetime in the Lab Frame ($\\tau$)\nDue to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the laboratory's frame of reference ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by a factor of $\\gamma$.\n*   Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$): $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Lab Frame Lifetime ($\\tau$):\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\times \\tau_0 = 8.918 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 7.134 \\times 10^{-15}$ s\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L)\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. For a highly relativistic particle ($\\gamma \\gg 1$), the velocity ($v$) is very close to the speed of light ($c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s). The decay length can be calculated as $L = v \\times \\tau$. A more precise formula, and the one we will use, is $L = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\n*   $L = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times \\sqrt{8.918^2 - 1}$\n*   $L = (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times \\sqrt{79.53 - 1}$\n*   $L = (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times \\sqrt{78.53} \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times 8.86$\n*   $L \\approx 2.126 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n### Step 4: Interpret \"Resolution\" and the 30% Condition\nTo observe a decay, the particle must travel a distance that can be resolved by the detector. The mean decay length ($L$) is the characteristic distance a particle travels. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume the minimum required resolution is on the order of the mean decay length.\n\nThe problem states that at least 30% of the decays must be observable. If we set the detector's resolution to be equal to the mean decay length ($d = L$), the fraction of particles that travel *further* than this distance before decaying (and are thus \"observable\") is given by the exponential decay law:\n$P(x > L) = e^{-L/L} = e^{-1} \\approx 0.368$\n\nSince 36.8% is greater than 30%, setting the resolution to the mean decay length satisfies the condition. The value we calculated for the mean decay length, $L \\approx 2.13 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is extremely close to option C. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's given values or physical constants.\n\n*   **Calculated value:** $2.13 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n*   **Option C:** $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nBased on this analysis, the value from option C is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
