    "The potentials for an arbitrarily moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the fact that the electromagnetic field propagates at the finite speed of light, *c*. Therefore, the potential at an observation point **`r`** at time *t* is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier \"retarded\" time, *tr*.\n\nThe retarded time *tr* is implicitly defined by the relation `t - tr = d/c`, where `d` is the magnitude of the vector `d` from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`.\n\nThe scalar potential *V* and vector potential **A** are given by:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    `V(r,t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c)]`\n    Rearranging the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by *c* gives:\n    `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n*   **Vector Potential (A):**\n    The vector potential is related to the scalar potential by the expression `A = (v/c²)V`.\n    Using this relationship, we find:\n    `A(r,t) = v/c² * [qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))]`\n    Since `c² = 1/(ε₀μ₀)`, it follows that `1/(ε₀c²) = μ₀`. Substituting this gives:\n    `A(r,t) = (μ₀qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\nComparing these derived expressions with the given options, we find that option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
