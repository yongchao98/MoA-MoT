    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state |n, l, m⟩ to a final state occurs via electromagnetic transitions, governed by selection rules. The problem specifies two consecutive electric dipole transitions.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Selection Rules\n\nFor an electric dipole (E1) transition, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, n, is not restricted: Δn = any integer.\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, l, must be ±1: Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, m, must be 0 or ±1: Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → Intermediate State\n\nThe initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which corresponds to the 3s orbital.\n*   n_initial = 3\n*   l_initial = 0\n*   m_initial = 0\n\nThe problem states this is the first of two dipole transitions to reach |1,0,0⟩. The options provided suggest the intermediate state has n=2. Let's verify this is an allowed transition.\n\nApplying the selection rules to the first transition:\n*   **l_intermediate**: Since l_initial = 0, the selection rule Δl = ±1 dictates that l_intermediate must be 1. This corresponds to a *p* orbital. The options correctly identify the intermediate state as a |2,1,m'⟩ state (a 2p orbital).\n*   **m_intermediate**: Since m_initial = 0, the selection rule Δm = 0, ±1 allows for m_intermediate to be 0, +1, or -1.\n\nTherefore, the possible intermediate states after the first transition are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Second Transition: Intermediate State → |1,0,0⟩\n\nThe final state is |1,0,0⟩ (the 1s orbital).\n*   n_final = 1\n*   l_final = 0\n*   m_final = 0\n\nLet's check if a transition from the possible intermediate states |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed:\n*   **Δl**: l_intermediate = 1 and l_final = 0. So, Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the selection rule.\n*   **Δm**:\n    *   For the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩: Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - 0 = 0. Allowed.\n    *   For the intermediate state |2,1,1⟩: Δm = 0 - 1 = -1. Allowed.\n    *   For the intermediate state |2,1,-1⟩: Δm = 0 - (-1) = +1. Allowed.\n\nAll three decay routes through the |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩ states are permitted by the selection rules. The options provided list two of these valid routes.\n\n### 4. Determining the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability associated with a specific transition route. This corresponds to the branching ratio for the first decay step, i.e., the probability that the initial |3,0,0⟩ state will decay into one specific intermediate state out of the three possible ones.\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (l=0). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the probability of the atom spontaneously decaying into any of the allowed final magnetic substates (m' = -1, 0, +1) is equal.\n\nSince there are three possible, equally likely final states for the first transition, the probability of decaying into any single one of them is:\n```latex\nProbability = \\frac{1}{\\text{Number of possible states}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n```\nThus, the probabilities for each of the initial decay paths are:\n*   P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = 1/3\n*   P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩) = 1/3\n*   P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = 1/3\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's compare our findings with the given choices:\n\n*   **A)** |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and a probability of 1/4. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B)** |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and a probability of 1/4. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C)** |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and a probability of 2/3. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D)** |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and a probability of 1/3. The route is valid, and the probability matches our calculation.\n\nTherefore, option D correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding branching ratio probability.\n\n<<<D>>>"
