    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Normalization of the state |α>**\n\nThe given state is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. Let's call this unnormalized state |α'>.\n`|α'> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`\n\nTo normalize it, we need to find the constant C such that `|α> = C|α'>` and `<α|α> = 1`.\n\nThe inner product `<α'|α'>` is:\n`<α'|α'> = <((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)|((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)>`\n`<α'|α'> = (1-i)(1+i)<up|up> + (2+i)(2-i)<down|down>`\nSince `<up|up> = 1` and `<down|down> = 1`, we have:\n`<α'|α'> = (1² + 1²) + (2² + (-1)²) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nSo, `|C|² * 7 = 1`, which gives `C = 1/√7`.\nThe normalized state is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn vector notation, where `|up> = [1, 0]` and `|down> = [0, 1]`, the state is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n\n**2. Finding the Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of Operator A**\n\nThe operator A is defined by its matrix elements: `Aij = ħ/2` if `i ≠ j`, and `0` otherwise. For a 2-level system (spin up/down), the matrix is:\n`A = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -λ ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues: `λ₁ = +ħ/2` and `λ₂ = -ħ/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\n*   For `λ₁ = +ħ/2`:\n    `[[ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ]] [x, y] = [0, 0]`\n    This leads to `-x + y = 0`, or `x = y`. The normalized eigenvector is `|a₁> = (1/√2) * [1, 1]`, which is `(1/√2) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n*   For `λ₂ = -ħ/2`:\n    `[[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ]] [x, y] = [0, 0]`\n    This leads to `x + y = 0`, or `x = -y`. The normalized eigenvector is `|a₂> = (1/√2) * [1, -1]`, which is `(1/√2) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Measurement Probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|aᵢ>` is given by `Pᵢ = |<aᵢ|α>|²`.\n\n*   **Probability for λ₁ = +ħ/2 (eigenstate |a₁>)**:\n    `P₁ = |<a₁|α>|² = |( (1/√2) * (<up| + <down|) ) * ( (1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>) )|²`\n    `<a₁|α> = (1/√14) * [(1)(1+i) + (1)(2-i)] = (1/√14) * (3)`\n    `P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n\n*   **Probability for λ₂ = -ħ/2 (eigenstate |a₂>)**:\n    `P₂ = |<a₂|α>|² = |( (1/√2) * (<up| - <down|) ) * ( (1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>) )|²`\n    `<a₂|α> = (1/√14) * [(1)(1+i) - (1)(2-i)] = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (1/√14) * (-1 + 2i)`\n    `P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n**4. Calculating the Average Value of the Operator A**\n\nThe average (or expectation) value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities**\n    `<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂`\n    `<A> = (9/14)(+ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5) = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7`\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the formula `<A> = <α|A|α>`**\n    `<A> = ( (1/√7) * [1-i, 2+i] ) * ( (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] ) * ( (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i] )`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * [1-i, 2+i] * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [1+i, 2-i]`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * [1-i, 2+i] * [2-i, 1+i]`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ] = (ħ/14) * 2 = ħ/7`\n\nBoth methods yield `<A> = ħ/7`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is ħ/7. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
