    "Here is a breakdown of the multi-step synthesis to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with a strong base like potassium hydroxide (KOH), undergoes a complex rearrangement reaction. Despite the unusual ¹H NMR data provided in the problem description, this reaction is known in the chemical literature to produce **protoadamantan-4-one** as Product 1. The characteristic infrared (IR) absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ confirms the presence of a ketone (C=O) group.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is then heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. However, the subsequent reaction step (ozonolysis) implies the presence of a double bond. Therefore, the conditions must also favor the dehydration of the newly formed alcohol. The ketone is first reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol, which then loses a molecule of water to form an alkene. The resulting alkene, Product 2, is **protoadamant-4-ene**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is subjected to ozonolysis, followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis is a reaction that cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. The cleavage of the double bond in protoadamant-4-ene followed by rearrangement of the carbon skeleton results in the formation of a dialdehyde, specifically **cis-bicyclo[3.3.0]octane-2,6-dicarbaldehyde**, which is Product 3.\n\n**Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\nThe final step is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in *cis*-bicyclo[3.3.0]octane-2,6-dicarbaldehyde, excluding the acidic aldehyde protons.\n\n1.  **Most Deshielded Protons:** The protons located on the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to an aldehyde group are the most deshielded. In Product 3, these are the protons at positions C2 and C6. Due to the molecule's C₂ symmetry, these two protons are chemically equivalent.\n2.  **Neighboring Protons:** We will analyze the coupling for the proton at C2 (H2). It is coupled to protons on adjacent carbons:\n    *   The single proton on the bridgehead carbon, C1.\n    *   The two protons on the methylene carbon, C3.\n3.  **Splitting Pattern:**\n    *   The single proton at C1 will split the signal of H2 into a **doublet**.\n    *   The two protons at C3 will split the signal of H2 into a **triplet**. This assumes that the coupling constants to these two protons are similar, which is a reasonable approximation for protons on a flexible five-membered ring.\n\nCombining these effects, the signal for the most deshielded proton (H2 or H6) is split into a doublet by H1, and each line of that doublet is further split into a triplet by the protons at C3. This results in a **doublet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
