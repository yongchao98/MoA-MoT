    "The analysis of the problem seems to be correct based on my initial reasoning and the search results confirm this. Here's a summary of the steps and the conclusion.\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle is spin-1/2 and its magnetic moment `μ = γS` is aligned with a magnetic field in the `+z` direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the `Sz` operator, specifically the `|+z>` state (spin up). The initial state vector is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**: The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the `+y` direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H = -μ · B = -γ * S_y * B`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian, we get `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γ * B * S_y * t / ħ) |+z>`.\n\n4.  **Larmor Precession**: This is a classic example of Larmor precession. A magnetic moment `μ` (and the associated spin `S`) in a magnetic field `B` will precess around the direction of `B`. The angular frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Larmor Frequency**: The energy difference between the two spin eigenstates in the magnetic field `B` is `ΔE`. The spin-up and spin-down states along the y-axis have energies `E_± = -γB(±ħ/2)`. The energy difference is `ΔE = |E_+ - E_-| = |(-γBħ/2) - (γBħ/2)| = | -γBħ |`. The frequency is given by `ω = ΔE / ħ`.\n    Therefore, the angular frequency is `ω = | -γBħ | / ħ = |γ|B`. Since the options do not involve an absolute value, and `γB` is the standard form for Larmor frequency, we'll proceed with `ω = γB`.\n\n6.  **Expectation Value Oscillation**: We are interested in the oscillation of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz>(t) = γ<Sz>(t)`. We need to calculate `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`.\n    From the initial derivation:\n    `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    Therefore, `<μz>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n\n7.  **Oscillation Frequency**: The expression for `<μz>(t)` is a cosine function of time `t`, specifically `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine function, which is `ω = γB`. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nThis confirms the result from the initial thought process. The average of the z-component of the particle's moment will oscillate with an angular frequency of `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
