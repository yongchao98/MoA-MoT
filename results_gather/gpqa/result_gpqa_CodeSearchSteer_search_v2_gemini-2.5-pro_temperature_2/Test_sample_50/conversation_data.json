    "To solve this problem, we use the method of image charges. For a point charge *q* located a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R*, the electric field and potential outside the sphere are equivalent to the field produced by the original charge *q* and an \"image\" charge *q'* located within the sphere.\n\n1.  **Determine the image charge and its position:**\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge, *q'*, is given by `q' = -q(R/d)`.\n    *   The image charge is located at a distance *d'* from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center and the point charge *q*. This distance is `d' = R^2/d`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from an infinite distance to the distance *d* from the sphere's center. It is important to note that the potential energy of the system is not simply the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge. Instead, it is half the interaction energy. This is because the image charge is not a fixed entity but is induced by and dependent on the real charge.\n\n    The potential at the location of the charge *q* due to the image charge *q'* is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - d')`\n    where *k* is the Coulomb constant (`k = 1 / (4πε₀)`).\n\n    Substituting the expressions for *q'* and *d'*:\n    `V_image = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    `V_image = k * [-qR/d] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    `V_image = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    The net potential energy (*U*) of the system is half the product of the real charge and the potential created by the image charge at the location of the real charge:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    This can also be found by integrating the force on the charge *q* as it is brought from infinity. The force on the charge *q* at a distance *x* from the center is `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`. The work done (and thus the potential energy) to bring the charge from infinity to *d* is the integral of this force, which yields the same result.\n\n    Comparing our result with the given options:\n    A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    B) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\n    The calculated potential energy `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
