    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which describes the power radiated from a black body. The information regarding the mass of the stars is not required for this calculation.\n\nThe luminosity (L) of a star behaving as a black body is given by the formula:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nwhere:\n*   **R** is the radius of the star.\n*   **σ** is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **T** is the effective surface temperature of the star.\n\nTo find the ratio of the luminosities (L₁/L₂), we can set up the following equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂) * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nWe are given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂), so the ratio of their radii squared is:\n\n(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\nNext, we need to determine the ratio of their temperatures (T₁/T₂). This can be found using Wien's Displacement Law, which relates a star's temperature to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (peak wavelength, λ_max). The law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature (λ_max = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant).\n\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths for both stars are the same. However, Star_2 has a significant radial velocity (700 km/s), which will cause a relativistic Doppler shift in the light we observe. Since the radial velocity is positive, the star is moving away, and its light will be redshifted to a longer observed wavelength. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength (λ_obs₁ = λ_em₁).\n\nFor Star_2, the observed wavelength (λ_obs₂) is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_em₂) by the relativistic Doppler shift formula for a receding source:\n\nλ_obs₂ = λ_em₂ * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]\n\nwhere 'v' is the radial velocity and 'c' is the speed of light.\n\nSince the observed wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂), we have:\n\nλ_em₁ = λ_em₂ * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]\n\nFrom Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_em). Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n\nT₁/T₂ = λ_em₂ / λ_em₁\n\nSubstituting the expression from the Doppler shift, we get:\n\nT₁/T₂ = 1 / √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)] = √[(1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c)]\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of v/c:\n*   v = 700 km/s\n*   c ≈ 300,000 km/s\n*   v/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nSubstitute this into the temperature ratio equation:\n\nT₁/T₂ = √[(1 - 0.002333) / (1 + 0.002333)] ≈ √[0.997667 / 1.002333] ≈ 0.99767\n\nFinally, we can calculate the luminosity ratio:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (0.99767)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>"
