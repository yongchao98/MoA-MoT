    "1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** Substituted biphenyl compounds can exhibit a type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism, which arises from restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. If bulky groups are present in the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), they can hinder free rotation, leading to stable, non-interconvertible stereoisomers. This restricted rotation creates a chiral axis, making the molecule chiral even without a traditional chiral carbon atom. The discovery of this phenomenon was based on the resolution of 6,6â€²-dinitrodiphenic acid into two optically active forms. In the case of dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, the large nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups in the ortho positions cause significant steric hindrance, preventing the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar. This lack of free rotation results in a chiral molecule that is optically active.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, possesses a chiral center. The second carbon atom in the chain is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). Molecules with a carbon atom attached to four distinct groups are asymmetric and can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers. These enantiomers rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions, thus exhibiting optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone:** The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. To be optically active, a molecule typically needs a chiral center or an element of axial or planar chirality, and it must not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Benzophenone does not have a chiral carbon. The molecule as a whole is achiral due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, and therefore it is not optically active.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. It contains a carbon-carbon double bond, which gives rise to geometrical isomerism (cis-trans isomerism), but it does not have a chiral center. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral and optically inactive.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (an atropisomer) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (contains a chiral center) exhibit optical isomerism. Benzophenone and dimethyl fumarate are both achiral and thus do not show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
