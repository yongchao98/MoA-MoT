    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to find the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n1.  **Define the Equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex in solution dissociates into free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and EDTA ions (Y⁴⁻). The equilibrium reaction is:\n    **CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻**\n\n2.  **Determine the Dissociation Constant (K_d):** The problem provides the formation constant (K_f or KCa-EDTA), which is for the reverse reaction (Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ CaY²⁻). The dissociation constant (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    *   K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰\n    *   K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an Equilibrium Table (ICE Table):** Let 'x' be the change in concentration as the complex dissociates. The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M.\n\n| Species | Initial (I) | Change (C) | Equilibrium (E) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **CaY²⁻** | 0.02 M | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| **Ca²⁺** | 0 M | +x | x |\n| **Y⁴⁻** | 0 M | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression:** The expression for the dissociation constant is based on the concentrations at equilibrium.\n    K_d = [Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻] / [CaY²⁻]\n\n5.  **Solve for x:** Substitute the equilibrium values from the ICE table into the expression.\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n    Because K_d is extremely small, the amount of complex that dissociates ('x') will be negligible compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). We can simplify the equation by approximating (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. This approach is standard for these types of equilibrium problems.\n\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n    Now, solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\n    Finally, solve for x by taking the square root:\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n6.  **Final Answer:** The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n    [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
