    "To arrange the substances in increasing order of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\nFirst, the substituents are classified based on their effect on the reaction rate and the position of substitution:\n*   **Activating, Ortho/Para-directing:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) **-CH3** (Toluene)\n    *   5) **-C2H5** (Ethylbenzene)\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho/Para-directing:** These groups withdraw electron density (deactivating the ring) but have lone pairs that can be donated through resonance, directing the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-directing:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The yield of ortho and para isomers is consequently very low.\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   4) **-NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n\nBased on this classification, the substances that are meta-directing (4, 6, and 2) will produce the lowest yield of the para-isomer. The ortho/para-directing substances (1, 5, and 3) will produce the highest yields.\n\n**Ordering the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para Yields):**\n\nAmong the meta-directors, the strength of the deactivating effect influences the product distribution. More strongly deactivating groups lead to a higher proportion of the meta product and consequently, a lower proportion of the para product.\n*   **4) Nitrobenzene (-NO2):** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. Bromination yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with the para-isomer forming in yields often less than 1%. Therefore, nitrobenzene will have the lowest para-isomer yield.\n*   **6) Benzoic acid (-COOH) and 2) Ethyl benzoate (-COOC2H5):** Both the carboxylic acid and ester groups are strongly deactivating and meta-directing. Their deactivating strengths are comparable and only slightly weaker than the nitro group. It is generally considered that the deactivating effect follows the order -NO2 > -COOH > -COOR. This implies that the para yield for benzoic acid would be slightly higher than for nitrobenzene, and the para yield for ethyl benzoate would be slightly higher than for benzoic acid, although all will be very small.\nThus, the order of increasing para yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Ordering the Ortho/Para-Directors (Highest Para Yields):**\n\nFor ortho/para-directing groups, the ratio of ortho to para product is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n*   **1) Toluene (-CH3):** The methyl group is an activating ortho/para-director. For bromination, the para-isomer is generally favored over the ortho-isomer. Typical yields for the para-isomer are around 62-67%.\n*   **5) Ethylbenzene (-C2H5):** The ethyl group is slightly larger than the methyl group. This increases the steric hindrance at the ortho positions, which further favors the formation of the para-isomer compared to toluene. Therefore, the para-yield for ethylbenzene will be greater than for toluene.\n*   **3) Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** The chloro group is deactivating but directs ortho/para. Due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect, which is most pronounced at the ortho position, and some steric hindrance, the para-isomer is highly favored. Bromination of chlorobenzene yields as much as 89% of the para-isomer.\nThus, the order of increasing para yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Final Order:**\n\nCombining the two groups, we establish the complete sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the order: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
