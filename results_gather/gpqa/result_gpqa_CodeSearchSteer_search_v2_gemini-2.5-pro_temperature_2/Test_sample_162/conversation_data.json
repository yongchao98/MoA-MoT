    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Minimum volume of acid required**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the amount of strong acid needed to dissolve 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n\n1.  **Chemical Equation for Dissolution:**\n    The reaction between Fe(OH)₃ and a strong monobasic acid (represented by H⁺) is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n2.  **Calculate the Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Atomic mass of Iron (Fe) ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n    *   Atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol\n\n3.  **Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n4.  **Calculate the Moles of H⁺ needed:**\n    *   From the stoichiometry of the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 3 * (9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol) ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n5.  **Calculate the Volume of the 0.1 M Acid:**\n    *   The acid has a concentration of 0.1 M (moles/liter).\n    *   Volume (L) = Moles of H⁺ / Concentration of Acid\n    *   Volume (L) = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L\n    *   To convert the volume to cubic centimeters (cm³), we multiply by 1000 (since 1 L = 1000 cm³).\n    *   Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L = **28.07 cm³**\n\n### **Part 2: pH of the resulting solution**\n\nAfter dissolving the Fe(OH)₃, the 100 cm³ solution contains Fe³⁺ ions. These ions hydrolyze in water, making the solution acidic.\n\n1.  **Hydrolysis Equation:**\n    The hexa-aqua iron(III) ion, [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ (abbreviated as Fe³⁺), acts as a weak acid. The primary hydrolysis reaction is:\n    [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)\n    For simplicity: Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\n2.  **Find the Acid Dissociation Constant (Ka):**\n    The acid dissociation constant (Ka) for the Fe³⁺(aq) ion is approximately 9.0 x 10⁻⁴. Other sources cite values such as a log(Ka) of -2.19, which gives a Ka of 6.46 x 10⁻³, but the value from option B appears to be the most relevant for this problem context.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Initial Concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n    *   The total volume of the final solution is 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    *   The moles of Fe³⁺ produced are equal to the moles of Fe(OH)₃ dissolved.\n    *   Moles of Fe³⁺ ≈ 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume (L)\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = (9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 9.356 x 10⁻³ M\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE Table for Hydrolysis:**\n    We use the hydrolysis equation to find the equilibrium concentration of H⁺.\n    |             | Fe³⁺(aq)            | Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) | H⁺(aq) |\n    |-------------|---------------------|--------------|--------|\n    | **Initial** | 9.356 x 10⁻³ M      | 0            | 0      |\n    | **Change**  | -x                  | +x           | +x     |\n    | **Equilibrium**| (9.356 x 10⁻³) - x  | x            | x      |\n\n5.  **Calculate the Equilibrium [H⁺]:**\n    *   Ka = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\n    *   Let's assume a Ka value that aligns with one of the answers. Using the common literature value around 6.4 x 10⁻⁴: Ka = x² / ( (9.356 x 10⁻³) - x ). This leads to x ([H⁺]) ≈ 2.16 x 10⁻³ M, and a pH of 2.67. This is very close to option D.\n\n    Let's check the Ka implicitly used by option B (pH 2.04).\n    *   If pH = 2.04, then [H⁺] = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ M ≈ 9.12 x 10⁻³ M.\n    *   Let's re-calculate using a Ka that is cited elsewhere: 9.0 x 10⁻³ (pKa ~2.05). Let's use Ka = 8.9 x 10⁻⁴ for [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ as provided in some educational materials.\n\n    *   x = [H⁺],  [Fe³⁺] initial = C₀ = 9.356 x 10⁻³ M\n    *   Ka = x² / (C₀ - x)\n    *   Let's test the answer options directly as this is a multiple choice question.\n\n    If we test option **D**'s pH:\n    *   pH = 2.69\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ ≈ 2.04 x 10⁻³ M\n    *   Ka = (2.04 x 10⁻³)² / ((9.356 x 10⁻³) - (2.04 x 10⁻³))\n    *   Ka ≈ (4.16 x 10⁻⁶) / (7.316 x 10⁻³) ≈ 5.69 x 10⁻⁴. This Ka value is a very plausible literature value for the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺.\n\n    If we test option **B**'s pH:\n    *   pH = 2.04\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ ≈ 9.12 x 10⁻³ M\n    *   This concentration of H⁺ is nearly identical to the initial concentration of Fe³⁺ (9.356 x 10⁻³ M), implying almost complete hydrolysis, which is incorrect for a weak acid. A Ka would need to be very large. Ka ≈ (9.12e-3)² / (9.356e-3 - 9.12e-3) ≈ 0.35, which is far too high. There must be an error in option B's pH.\n\n    Let's re-examine the volume calculation. Our calculated volume of acid is 28.07 cm³. This matches the value in option B, but not option D. Given that multiple choice questions in this context often have a single correct numerical pairing, there may be an inconsistency in the question's provided options or the intended constants.\n\n    However, the calculation for the volume of acid is direct and based on fundamental stoichiometry, yielding **28.05 cm³** (using more precise atomic weights might yield this exact value). The pH calculation depends on a literature constant (Ka) that can vary. It's common in such problems for the most direct calculation (stoichiometry) to be the intended anchor for the correct option. The pH value given in option B (2.04) is highly unlikely to be correct, but the volume is. Let's consider the possibility that the volume from option D (30.09 cm³) arises from a different calculation. This would require more H+ ions, for reasons not explained by simple dissolution (e.g., reaching a certain pH *after* dissolution).\n\n    Based on the stoichiometric calculation, the required volume of acid is 28.07 cm³. Option B has 28.05 cm³. Let's trust this part of the calculation.\n    Let's re-calculate the pH using the numbers from option D.\n    [H+] = 10^-2.69 = 2.04 * 10^-3 M\n    The initial concentration of Fe3+ is 9.36*10-3 M.\n    Ka = (2.04*10^-3)^2 / (9.36*10^-3-2.04*10^-3) = 5.68 * 10^-4. This is a very reasonable Ka for Fe3+.\n    Let's re-evaluate the question as it seems one of the values in each option is correct. The volume of 28.05 cm^3 from option B is derived directly from the primary stoichiometry and most likely correct. The pH of 2.69 from option D is derived from a very reasonable equilibrium constant. This implies an error in the question's option pairing. If forced to choose the \"best\" answer, the calculation for the required reactant volume is more certain than the one for the resulting pH, which relies on a constant that varies in literature. Thus option B appears the intended answer despite its questionable pH value. A possible reason for the pH=2.04 value could be the use of a Ka for Fe³⁺ of about 1 x 10⁻², which some older or different sources might cite. This would still not yield exactly 2.04.\n\nLet's proceed by assuming the calculation for the volume of acid is the key to select the correct answer.\n\nFinal calculated volume: **28.07 cm³**\nFinal calculated pH: **2.69** (based on a common Ka value)\n\nThe volume calculation strongly points towards option B. The pH calculation points towards option D. Given that the volume calculation is more fundamental to the question setup let's proceed with B and highlight the discrepancy. It appears there is an error in the provided options, where the pH from one correct choice and the volume from another might have been mixed. But if a single choice has to be made, the stoichiometric part is the most certain one.\n\nRechecking all calculations:\nMoles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1g / 106.867 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol.\nMoles H+ = 3 * 0.0009357 = 0.002807 mol.\nVolume acid = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.\n[Fe³⁺] = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009357 M.\nUsing Ka=6.3x10⁻³, we have x = [H⁺].\n6.3x10⁻³ = x²/(0.009357-x).\nx² + 6.3x10⁻³x - 5.9x10⁻⁵ = 0.\nx = 5.2x10⁻³ M. pH = -log(5.2x10⁻³) = 2.28.\nThis pH value is not among the options.\n\nGiven the directness of the volume calculation (28.05 cm³) compared to the pH calculation's dependency on a variable Ka, option B is the most likely intended answer, despite the likely error in its stated pH value. The pH value of 2.69 aligns well with a standard Ka, but its associated volume is incorrect.\n\nFinal Decision Rationale: The stoichiometric calculation for the volume of acid is straightforward and yields a result that almost perfectly matches one of the options (28.07 cm³ ≈ 28.05 cm³). The pH calculation is dependent on the specific Ka value used, which varies in literature. Thus, the volume is the more reliable metric to identify the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
