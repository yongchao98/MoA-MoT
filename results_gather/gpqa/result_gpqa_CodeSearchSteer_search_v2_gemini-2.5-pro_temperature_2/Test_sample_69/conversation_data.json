    "This chemistry puzzle presents a series of reactions to identify several unknown substances. By systematically analyzing the clues, we can deduce the identity of the extremely hazardous product E and determine its molecular symmetry group.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the deductive process:\n*   The reaction that produces the extremely hazardous product E is `C + 2 D → E`. A well-known reaction that fits this stoichiometric relationship is the synthesis of xenon tetrafluoride (`XeF₄`) from xenon (`Xe`) and fluorine (`F₂`). The balanced equation for this synthesis is: `Xe + 2F₂ → XeF₄`.\n*   This suggests that C is xenon (Xe), D is fluorine gas (F₂), and E is xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄).\n*   Xenon tetrafluoride is a colorless crystalline solid. It is a powerful fluorinating agent and reacts violently with water, making it extremely hazardous to handle.\n*   The molecular geometry of `XeF₄` is determined by the VSEPR theory. The central xenon atom has four bonding pairs of electrons and two lone pairs. To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy axial positions, forcing the four fluorine atoms into a square planar arrangement around the central xenon atom.\n*   A square planar molecule, such as `XeF₄`, possesses a high degree of symmetry. Its point group is D₄h, which includes a principal C₄ rotation axis, perpendicular C₂ axes, and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), among other symmetry elements.\n\nAlthough some clues in the puzzle (like compound C being \"bright red\") create contradictions with the identification of C as Xenon, the stoichiometric requirement for the formation of E (`C + 2 D -> E`) provides a strong basis for identifying E as `XeF₄`. This identification leads directly to the molecular symmetry group.\n\nGiven that E is xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄), its molecular geometry is square planar, which belongs to the **D₄h** point group.\n\n<<<B>>>"
