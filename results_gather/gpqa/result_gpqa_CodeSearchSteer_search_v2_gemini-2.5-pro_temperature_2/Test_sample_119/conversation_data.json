    "My initial derivation concluded that the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) is proportional to 1/plx⁴. I will verify this with the search results.\n\nA 1979 paper in the *Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society* explicitly addresses this model. It states, \"We assume that stars are uniformly distributed in space. Then the number per unit parallax interval is dn = F(π)dπ = 4πρ/π⁴ dπ,\" where π represents parallax and ρ is the number of stars per unit volume. This directly confirms that for a uniform spatial distribution, the number of stars per unit parallax interval is proportional to 1/π⁴, or 1/plx⁴.\n\nThe logic is as follows:\n1.  **Uniform Distribution**: For a uniform distribution of stars in space, the number of stars `N` in a given volume `V` is simply proportional to that volume (`N ∝ V`).\n2.  **Volume Element**: Consider a thin spherical shell of space at a distance `r` from the observer with a small thickness `dr`. The volume of this shell is `dV = 4πr² dr`.\n3.  **Number of Stars in the Shell**: The number of stars `dN` in this shell is `dN ∝ dV`, so `dN ∝ r² dr`.\n4.  **Parallax-Distance Relation**: Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`r`), so `r = 1/plx`.\n5.  **Transforming the Interval**: We need to express `dr` in terms of `plx`. Differentiating `r = 1/plx` with respect to `plx` gives `dr/d(plx) = -1/plx²`. The negative sign just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases, so we consider the magnitude: `dr = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n6.  **Substitution**: Now, substitute the expressions for `r` and `dr` into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN ∝ (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    `dN ∝ (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n7.  **Number per Unit Parallax**: The number of stars per unit range of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, is therefore proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\nThis confirms my initial derivation and is supported by the astronomical literature.\n\n<<<B>>>"
