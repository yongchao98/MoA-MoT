    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Principle: Radioactive Decay is Memoryless\n\nRadioactive decay is a random process governed by quantum mechanics. A key principle is that the decay process is \"memoryless\". This means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already existed. An older nucleus is not more likely to decay than a younger one.\n\nTherefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its inherent decay probability for any future period. We can calculate the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes as if we were starting with a fresh atom at time t=0.\n\n### 2. Determine the Decay Constant (λ)\n\nThe probability of decay is described by the law of radioactive decay, where the number of nuclei `N` at a time `t` is given by `N(t) = N₀ * e^(-λt)`. From this, the probability that a single atom survives until time `t` is `P(survival) = e^(-λt)`, and the probability that it decays *within* time `t` is:\n\n**P(decay, t) = 1 - e^(-λt)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to find the decay constant `λ`.\n\n*   `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n*   `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n*   `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\nTo solve for `λ`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n*   `-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n*   `λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\nCalculating this value gives:\n*   `λ ≈ -(-0.3857) / 100`\n*   `λ ≈ 0.003857 per minute`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes\n\nBecause of the memoryless property, we need to find the probability that the atom will decay in any 150-minute interval. We use the same formula, this time with t = 150 minutes.\n\n*   `P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for `λ` that we found in the previous step:\n\n*   `P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^((-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150)`\n*   `P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)`, this simplifies to:\n\n*   `P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))`\n\nSince `e^(ln(x)) = x`, the equation becomes:\n\n*   `P(decay, 150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5`\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nNow, we just need to compute the value:\n\n*   `0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n*   `P(decay, 150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607`\n*   `P(decay, 150) ≈ 0.4393`\n\nConverting this probability to a percentage gives approximately 43.93%.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probability of 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
