    "Here is a step-by-by-step breakdown of the solution to determine how long the journey to Earth will take from the astronaut's perspective.\n\n### 1. Determine the Distance\n\nFirst, we need to know the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Earth. The LMC is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. According to multiple astronomical observations, the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 163,000 light-years.\n\n*   **Distance (d):** 163,000 light-years\n\n### 2. Calculate the Time from an Earth Observer's Perspective\n\nFrom the perspective of a stationary observer on Earth, the time it takes for the spacecraft to travel from the LMC to Earth is the distance divided by the speed.\n\n*   **Speed (v):** 0.99999987 * c (where 'c' is the speed of light)\n*   **Time (t) = Distance / Speed**\n*   t = 163,000 light-years / 0.99999987 c\n*   t ≈ 163,000.0208 years\n\nSo, for an observer on Earth, the journey would take approximately 163,000 years.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Time from the Astronaut's Perspective (Time Dilation)\n\nDue to the effects of special relativity, time for the moving astronaut will pass slower than for a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation. We can calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time, t') using the time dilation formula.\n\nThe formula is: **t' = t * √(1 - v²/c²)**\n\nWhere:\n*   **t'** is the time experienced by the astronaut.\n*   **t** is the time measured by the stationary observer (163,000.0208 years).\n*   **v** is the spacecraft's velocity (0.99999987 * c).\n*   **c** is the speed of light.\n\nLet's calculate the term (v/c)²:\n*   (v/c) = 0.99999987\n*   (v/c)² = 0.9999997400000169\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the time dilation formula:\n*   t' = 163,000.0208 * √(1 - 0.9999997400000169)\n*   t' = 163,000.0208 * √(0.0000002599999831)\n*   t' = 163,000.0208 * 0.0005099019346\n*   t' ≈ 83.11 years\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe journey will take approximately 83.11 years from the astronaut's point of view. The astronaut starts the journey at 22 years old.\n\n*   **Age at end of journey:** 22 + 83.11 = 105.11 years\n\nSince the astronaut's average lifespan is 150 years, they will survive the journey.\n\nGiven the choices:\nA) 72 years\nB) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\nC) 77 years\nD) 81 years\n\nThe calculated time of ~83 years is closest to 81 years. The minor difference can be attributed to rounding in the distance to the LMC or the exact speed value. Therefore, 81 years is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
