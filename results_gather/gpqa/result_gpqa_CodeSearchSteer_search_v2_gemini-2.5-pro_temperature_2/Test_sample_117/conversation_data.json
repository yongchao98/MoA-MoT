    "The reaction between an enol and bromine is a well-established reaction in organic chemistry. Enols contain an electron-rich carbon-carbon double bond, which is highly reactive toward electrophiles like bromine.\n\nThe general outcome of the reaction between an enol and a halogen (such as Br2) is the formation of an α-haloketone. The reaction proceeds through the following steps:\n1.  **Electrophilic Attack:** The pi bond of the enol acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic bromine molecule (Br2). This is similar to the first step of electrophilic addition to a standard alkene.\n2.  **Intermediate Formation:** This attack results in the formation of a new carbon-bromine bond at the α-carbon (the carbon that was part of the double bond but does not bear the hydroxyl group). A resonance-stabilized intermediate is formed.\n3.  **Deprotonation:** A base (which can be the bromide ion, Br-, formed in the first step, or a solvent molecule) removes the proton from the hydroxyl group. This step regenerates the carbonyl (C=O) double bond.\n\nApplying this to the specific reactants:\n*   **Reactant:** 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The double bond is between C1 and C2, and the hydroxyl group is on C1.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Product:** The reaction will place a bromine atom at the α-carbon (C2) and convert the enol group at C1 into a ketone (carbonyl group). The result is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n*   Options A and D, (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol and (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, are dihaloalcohols. While addition of Br2 across a double bond is a standard reaction, the initial product of addition to an enol, a gem-halohydrin (a halogen and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon), is unstable and would quickly lose HBr to form the more stable ketone.\n*   Option C, 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, is incorrect because the halogenation occurs at the α-carbon, which was the site of the enol's double bond, not at a remote position.\n\nTherefore, the major product is the α-bromoketone.\n\n<<<B>>>"
