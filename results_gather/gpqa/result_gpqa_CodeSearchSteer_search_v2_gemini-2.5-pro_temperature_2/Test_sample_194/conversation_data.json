    "To solve this problem, we follow a series of logical steps to connect the properties of the two planets through their common orbital inclination.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the relationship between orbital parameters**\n\nThe transit impact parameter `b` is the projected distance of the planet's center from the star's center at the point of closest approach, normalized by the star's radius. It is given by the formula:\n`b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`\nwhere:\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `i` is the orbital inclination (the angle between the orbital plane and our line of sight).\n*   `R_s` is the radius of the star.\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of a planet's orbital period `P` is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis `a`.\n`P² ∝ a³` or `a ∝ P²/³`.\n\nBy substituting the relation for `a` into the impact parameter equation, we can see that `b` is proportional to `P²/³` for planets in the same system (where `i` and `R_s` are constant).\n\n### **Step 2: Relate the two planets**\nSince both planets are in the same system and share the same orbital plane, the stellar radius `R_s` and the inclination `i` are the same for both. We can therefore establish a ratio:\n\n`b₂ / b₁ = a₂ / a₁`\n\nAnd from Kepler's law:\n\n`a₂ / a₁ = (P₂ / P₁)²/³`\n\nCombining these gives us a direct relationship between the impact parameters and orbital periods of the two planets:\n\n`b₂ / b₁ = (P₂ / P₁)²/³`\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the condition for transit**\nA planet is considered to exhibit a transit event if it passes in front of its star. While a partial transit can occur if any part of the planet overlaps the star (`b < 1 + R_p/R_s`), a common and stringent condition for a transit is that the *center* of the planet must pass over the star's disk. This means the impact parameter `b` must be less than or equal to 1. The problem asks for the *maximum* orbital period, which corresponds to the maximum possible semi-major axis and therefore the maximum impact parameter, `b₂_max`. Based on this interpretation, we set `b₂_max = 1`. For a circular orbit, a transit guarantees an occultation will also occur.\n\nThe information about the radii of the planets and the star is therefore not needed for the calculation under this standard interpretation, other than to confirm the initial conditions are physically plausible.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the maximum period for Planet 2**\nWe have the following information:\n*   For Planet 1: `b₁ = 0.2` and `P₁ = 3` days.\n*   For Planet 2: We need to find the maximum `P₂`, which occurs at `b₂_max = 1`.\n\nNow we can plug these values into our derived equation:\n\n`1 / 0.2 = (P₂ / 3)²/³`\n\n`5 = (P₂ / 3)²/³`\n\nTo solve for `P₂`, we raise both sides to the power of `3/2`:\n\n`5^(3/2) = P₂ / 3`\n\n`P₂ = 3 * 5^(1.5)`\n\n`P₂ ≈ 3 * 11.1803`\n\n`P₂ ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThis value is approximately 33.5 days, which matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
