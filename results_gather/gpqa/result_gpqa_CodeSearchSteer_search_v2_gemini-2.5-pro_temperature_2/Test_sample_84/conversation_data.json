    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 2, we can use the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and the radial velocity method for exoplanet detection. All the necessary information to solve the problem is provided in the prompt.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a))`\n    where `T_star` is the star's effective temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `A` is the planet's albedo, and `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n    To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 (`T_eq1`) and Planet 2 (`T_eq2`), we can set up the following equation:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a2))]`\n\n    Since the star's properties (`T_star`, `R_star`) are the same for both planets and it is given that their albedos (`A`) are also the same, most terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\n2.  **Determining the Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity Data:**\n    The problem states the planets were detected using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The RV method measures the wobble of the star caused by the orbiting planet. The amplitude of this velocity (the \"semi-amplitude,\" K) is related to the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines.\n\n    The Doppler shift (`Δλ`) is related to the radial velocity (`v_r`) by `v_r = c * (Δλ / λ)`, where `c` is the speed of light and `λ` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line. The problem provides the maximum Doppler shifts, which correspond to the radial velocity semi-amplitude `K`. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:\n    `K1 / K2 = (c * Δλ1 / λ) / (c * Δλ2 / λ) = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4`\n\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is also related to the planet's mass (`M_p`), the star's mass (`M_star`), the semi-major axis (`a`), and the orbital inclination (`i`) by the formula:\n    `K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n\n    Since the planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight, which means the inclination `i` is approximately 90°, and therefore `sin(i) ≈ 1`. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n    `a = (G * M_p^2 * sin^2(i)) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n    Now we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`, assuming `sin(i)` is the same for both:\n    `a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n\n    The gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    We are given the following information:\n    *   Mass of Planet 1 (`M_p1`) = 7 Earth masses\n    *   Mass of Planet 2 (`M_p2`) = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (`Δλ1`) = 0.03 Å\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (`Δλ2`) = 0.04 Å\n\n    First, calculate the mass ratio and the RV semi-amplitude ratio:\n    *   `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n    *   `K1 / K2 = 3 / 4`\n\n    Next, substitute these values into the equation for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    `a2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784`\n\n    Finally, use this ratio to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28`\n\n    Converting this fraction to a decimal:\n    `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>"
