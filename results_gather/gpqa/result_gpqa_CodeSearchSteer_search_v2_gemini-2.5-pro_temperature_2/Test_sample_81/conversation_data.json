    "The synthesis of Product 3 occurs in three sequential steps:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene + Maleic Anhydride → Product 1**\n    Under thermal conditions, cyclooctatetraene (COT) exists in equilibrium with its more reactive valence isomer, bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. This isomer contains a *cis*-locked diene (a cyclohexadiene ring) which readily undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction with maleic anhydride, an excellent dienophile. The Diels-Alder reaction is stereoselective, and the major product is the *endo* adduct, as it is favored kinetically due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. Product 1 is therefore the *endo*-adduct of bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene and maleic anhydride.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + Methanol/H₂SO₄ → Product 2**\n    This step involves the acid-catalyzed esterification of the anhydride group in Product 1. Heating with methanol (MeOH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) opens the anhydride ring to form two methyl ester groups (-COOCH₃). This reaction, a Fischer esterification, does not alter the stereocenters of the polycyclic framework. Since the original anhydride was formed from *cis*-dienophile (maleic anhydride), the two resulting ester groups are *cis* to each other. Product 2 is the dimethyl *cis*-dicarboxylate with the same *endo* stereochemistry as Product 1.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + Cyclopentadiene → Product 3**\n    This is a second Diels-Alder reaction. Here, the diester (Product 2) acts as the dienophile and cyclopentadiene acts as the diene. Product 2 has two double bonds, one in the cyclobutene ring and another in the norbornene-like system formed in the first Diels-Alder reaction. The double bond in the norbornene-like system is highly strained and thus a reactive dienophile. The cyclopentadiene will add across this double bond. The stereochemical outcome of this reaction is governed by sterics. The two bulky ester groups are on the *endo* face of the molecule. The cyclopentadiene will therefore approach from the opposite, less sterically hindered *exo* face. This results in the formation of Product 3 where the newly formed methano bridge is *anti* (on the opposite side) to the two ester groups.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe major isomer of the final product (Product 3) possesses the following stereochemical features:\n*   The two methoxycarbonyl groups are *cis* to one another, resulting from the maleic anhydride starting material.\n*   These two ester groups are in an *endo* position with respect to the first Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   The methano bridge, formed from the addition of cyclopentadiene, is in an *exo* position relative to the dienophile of the second reaction, which places it *anti* (trans) to the ester groups.\n\nComparing this predicted three-dimensional structure with the provided options, the name and SMILES string for option C correctly describe this specific isomer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
