    "Here is the step-by-step derivation for the solution:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. This shift in wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (K), which is the star's speed along our line of sight. Therefore, the ratio of the maximum wavelength shifts is equal to the ratio of the stars' maximum radial velocities (known as the RV semi-amplitude, K).\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 mÅ / 7 mÅ\n\n2.  **Connect Radial Velocity to Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass (mₚ), the star's mass (Mₛ), and the orbital period (P) by the following relationship.\n    *   K is proportional to mₚ / (Mₛ²/³ * P¹/³)\n\n3.  **Simplify the Proportionality:** The problem states that the masses of the two stars are identical (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂) and the masses of the two planets are similar (mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂). Because of this, the mass terms in the equation cancel out, leaving a simple relationship between the radial velocity (K) and the orbital period (P):\n    *   K is proportional to 1 / P¹/³\n\n4.  **Set up the Ratio of Periods:** We can now set up a ratio for the two systems to find the relationship between their periods.\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = (1 / P₁¹/³) / (1 / P₂¹/³)\n    *   This simplifies to: K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)¹/³\n\n5.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:** To find the ratio of the orbital periods (P₂ / P₁), we can cube both sides of the equation.\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, we substitute the given values for the wavelength shifts, which are proportional to K.\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe result is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
