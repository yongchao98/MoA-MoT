    "This problem is a classic example of relativistic velocity addition, famously demonstrated by the Fizeau experiment. To solve it, we must use the formula for adding velocities in special relativity, not simple Galilean addition.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The **laboratory frame** (let's call it S), where the observer is at rest.\n    *   The **glass's rest frame** (let's call it S'), which is moving with velocity `v` relative to the laboratory.\n\n2.  **Determine the velocities in each frame:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass with respect to the lab is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light *within* the glass (in the rest frame of the glass, S') is not `c`, but is reduced by the index of refraction `n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass, as measured in its own rest frame, is `u' = c/n = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    The formula for adding collinear velocities in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v/c^2)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the final velocity we want to find (the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the lab).\n    *   `u'` is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame (`1/n`).\n    *   `v` is the speed of the glass relative to the lab.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum (`1`).\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values and solve:**\n    *   Substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n        `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2)`\n\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    *   To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n        `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n        `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis final expression matches option B. This result was one of the early confirmations of Einstein's theory of special relativity, correctly explaining the results of Fizeau's 1851 experiment.\n\n<<<B>>>"
