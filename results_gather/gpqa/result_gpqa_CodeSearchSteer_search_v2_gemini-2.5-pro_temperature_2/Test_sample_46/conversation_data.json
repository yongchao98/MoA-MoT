    "Based on the provided spectroscopic data, the compound is identified by thoroughly analyzing its molecular formula, IR spectrum, and 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    The degree of unsaturation is calculated as 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two distinct bands at **3420 cm-1** and **3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   The strong absorption band at **1720 cm-1** indicates the presence of a carbonyl (C=O) group, consistent with the frequency of an ester conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to a methyl group (CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (CH2), resulting in a triplet.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a quartet, indicating a methylene group (CH2) next to a methyl group. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2-). Together, these two signals confirm the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) within an ester functionality.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is a classic signal for the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2). This corroborates the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons, signify a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at the higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm) is ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the doublet at the lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm) is ortho to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAll the spectral data point to a single structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group. This compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. A review of reference spectra confirms that the provided data are an excellent match for this compound.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given choices:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect NMR prediction for the alkyl chain.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Inconsistent with a primary amine.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Would show a meta-substitution pattern in the NMR, not two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
