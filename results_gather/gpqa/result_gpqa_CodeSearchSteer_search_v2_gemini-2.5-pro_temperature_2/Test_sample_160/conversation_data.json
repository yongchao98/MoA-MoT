    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2:\n\n1.  **Define Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ):\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\n2.  **Define λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules colliding with *each other*. The traveling particles and target particles are both gas molecules. The relevant cross-section is the molecule-molecule kinetic collision cross-section (σ₁). Thus, **λ1 = 1 / (n * σ₁)**. This cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the high-energy electrons (from the 1000 kV beam) scattering off the residual gas molecules. Here, the traveling particles are electrons and the target particles are gas molecules. The relevant cross-section is the electron-molecule scattering cross-section (σ₂). Thus, **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ₂)**.\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ₁ vs. σ₂):**\n    *   The number density (n) of the gas molecules is the same in both scenarios. Therefore, the comparison between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on the comparison between their respective collision cross-sections, σ₁ and σ₂.\n    *   **σ₁ (Molecule-Molecule):** This is a \"billiard ball\" type collision, and the cross-section is determined by the geometric size of the molecules. For two molecules to collide, their centers must come within a distance equal to the sum of their radii. The cross-section is approximately πd², where d is the molecular diameter.\n    *   **σ₂ (Electron-Molecule):** This collision is fundamentally different. It involves a very small, point-like particle (the electron) interacting with a gas molecule via the electromagnetic force. At the very high energy of 1000 keV, the electron is moving at relativistic speeds. This high velocity significantly reduces the interaction time with any single gas molecule, leading to a much smaller probability of scattering. Consequently, the scattering cross-section (σ₂) for a high-energy electron is considerably smaller than the kinetic cross-section between two much larger gas molecules (σ₁). Data for electron scattering shows that the cross-section decreases as electron energy increases into the keV range.\n\n4.  **Conclude the Relationship between λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   Based on the physics, the electron-molecule scattering cross-section is much smaller than the molecule-molecule kinetic cross-section: **σ₂ << σ₁**.\n    *   Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to the cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ), a smaller cross-section results in a longer mean free path.\n    *   Therefore, the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) must be significantly greater than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1): **λ2 >> λ1**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This option aligns with our conclusion that λ2 is greater than λ1.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This option suggests λ2 is only slightly larger than λ1, which contradicts our finding that the difference should be significant.\n    *   C) λ2 < λ1: This is incorrect. It would imply that electrons collide more frequently than gas molecules.\n    *   D) λ2 = λ1: This is incorrect as the collision dynamics and cross-sections are vastly different.\n\nThe most accurate conclusion is that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. Option A is the only choice that correctly reflects this physical reality.\n\n<<<A>>>"
