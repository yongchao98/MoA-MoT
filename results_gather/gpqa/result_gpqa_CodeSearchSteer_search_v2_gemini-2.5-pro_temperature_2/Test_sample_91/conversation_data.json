    "Here is a step-by-step calculation for the enthalpy of formation:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass**\n\n*   The chemical structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 hydrogen atoms.\n*   The molecular formula is C12H22.\n*   **Molar Mass:** Using atomic masses C ≈ 12 g/mol and H ≈ 1 g/mol, the molar mass is (12 * 12) + (22 * 1) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Molecule**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous molecule.\n\n*   **Count the bonds:**\n    *   C-H bonds: 22\n    *   C=C bonds: 2\n    *   C-C single bonds: 9\n*   **Use the given bond energies:**\n    *   Energy for C-H bonds = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n    *   Energy for C=C bonds = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n    *   Energy for C-C bonds = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   **Total bond energy (Enthalpy of atomization of the molecule):**\n    *   8800 + 600 + 1800 = 11200 kJ/mol\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states (12 C(s) and 11 H2(g)).\n\n*   **For Carbon:** The enthalpy of atomization for carbon is given as 1000 kJ/mol.\n    *   Energy for 12 moles of Carbon = 12 * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **For Hydrogen:** The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol. This is the energy to break one mole of H2 into two moles of H atoms. To get 22 moles of H atoms, we need to break 11 moles of H2 molecules.\n    *   Energy for 11 moles of H2 = 11 * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total enthalpy of atomization for the elements:**\n    *   12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the sum of the enthalpies of atomization of the elements minus the total bond energy of the molecule.\n\n*   ΔH_f = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of the molecule)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol\n\n**5. Convert the Units**\n\nThe question offers answers in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. It is necessary to check if our calculated value in kJ/mol matches any options or if a conversion is needed. Our result is 1900 kJ/mol. Option A has the correct number but the wrong units (kJ/g). Option D is in kJ/g. Let's convert our answer to kJ/g to check option D.\n\n*   ΔH_f in kJ/g = (ΔH_f in kJ/mol) / (Molar Mass in g/mol)\n*   ΔH_f in kJ/g = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.44 kJ/g\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
