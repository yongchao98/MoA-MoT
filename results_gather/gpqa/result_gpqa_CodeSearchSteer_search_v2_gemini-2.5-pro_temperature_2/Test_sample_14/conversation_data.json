    "The probability of an exoplanet to transit its host star is primarily determined by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's semi-major axis, especially for planets with circular orbits. Researchers observing two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have concluded that Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting. This conclusion is based on calculations involving the planets' orbital periods and the masses of their host stars.\n\nThe transit probability (p) for a planet in a circular orbit can be approximated by the formula: p ≈ R_s / a, where R_s is the stellar radius and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the orbit. Given that both host stars have the same radius (R_s1 = R_s2), the ratio of the transit probabilities of the two planets simplifies to the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes (p1 / p2 = a2 / a1).\n\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axes, Kepler's Third Law is used, which relates the orbital period (P), the semi-major axis (a), and the mass of the host star (M_s). The law can be expressed as a³ ∝ P² * M_s. This relationship allows for the calculation of the ratio of the semi-major axes based on the known orbital periods and stellar masses.\n\nThe provided data states that the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2 (P1 = P2 / 3), and the host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host star of Planet_2 (M_s1 = 2 * M_s2). By substituting these values into the derived ratio from Kepler's law, it is determined that the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2/a1) is approximately 1.65.\n\nConsequently, the ratio of the transit probabilities (p1/p2) is also approximately 1.65. This indicates that Planet_1 is about 1.65 times more likely to be observed transiting its star than Planet_2, leading the researchers to prioritize it for their observations.\n\n<<<A>>>"
