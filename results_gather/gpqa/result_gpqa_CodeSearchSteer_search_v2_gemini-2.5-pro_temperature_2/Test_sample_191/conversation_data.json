    "This problem deals with the principles of electrostatic induction and shielding in conductors. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the electric field at point P:\n\n1.  **Induction of Charges:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity attracts free electrons within the conductor. A total charge of `-q` accumulates on the inner surface of the cavity.\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conducting material shields the outer surface from the electric field created by the charges inside the cavity (`+q` and the induced `-q`). Consequently, the arrangement of the charge inside the cavity and the shape of the cavity do not influence the charge distribution on the outer surface.\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the shielding effect and the spherical shape of the conductor, the induced charge `+q` spreads uniformly over the outer surface.\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's Law (and the shell theorem), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge on the shell were concentrated at its center.\n6.  **Calculation:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the electric field `E` at point P is equivalent to the field of a point charge `+q` located at the conductor's center.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field is given by Coulomb's law:\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nAll other information, such as the cavity's radius `r`, its distance `s` from the center, the distance `l`, and the angle `Î¸`, is irrelevant for determining the electric field outside the conductor.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
