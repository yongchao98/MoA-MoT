    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the final product and the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step-by-step synthesis of Product 4**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid with Br₂, pyridine, and acetic anhydride → Product 1**\n    This reaction is an α-bromination of acetic acid. While not a standard Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, the presence of bromine and a base (pyridine) facilitates the formation of an enolate from acetic acid, which then reacts with bromine to yield bromoacetic acid.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n\n2.  **Product 1 + Ethanol (EtOH) / H₂SO₄ → Product 2**\n    This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n3.  **Product 2 + Sodium cyanide (NaCN) → Product 3**\n    This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (S_N2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion from ethyl bromoacetate.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess Sodium hydride (NaH) + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4**\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt).\n    *   The resulting carbanion is a strong nucleophile.\n    *   The stoichiometry of the reaction is not specified. Two plausible pathways exist:\n        *   **Pathway A (Intramolecular Cyclization):** One molecule of the ethyl cyanoacetate carbanion reacts with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane. A second deprotonation occurs, followed by an intramolecular S_N2 reaction to form a stable 6-membered ring. This leads to **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n        *   **Pathway B (Intermolecular Dimerization):** Two molecules of the ethyl cyanoacetate carbanion react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane at both ends. This would typically be favored if ethyl cyanoacetate is in a 2:1 ratio to the dibromopentane. This leads to **diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate**.\n\n    While intramolecular cyclization to form a 6-membered ring is often favored, let's analyze the NMR signals for both potential products, as the correct option may guide us to the intended product. The key instruction is to find the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, meaning we must account for stereochemistry and lack of symmetry.\n\n### **¹H NMR Analysis**\n\n**Case 1: Product 4 is Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate (from Pathway A)**\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a chiral center at C1 (the carbon bonded to CN and COOEt). It has no plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is asymmetric.\n*   **Distinct Hydrogens:** In an asymmetric molecule, all protons are chemically distinct unless they can be interchanged by rapid rotation (like in a methyl group).\n    1.  **Ethyl group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the **CH₃** group are equivalent by rotation. This is **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the **-OCH₂-** group are adjacent to a chiral center (through the ester linkage). This makes them diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane ring (-C₆H₁₀-):**\n        *   Because there is no plane of symmetry, the methylene groups at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 are all chemically distinct from one another.\n        *   Within each of these five CH₂ groups, the two geminal protons are diastereotopic due to the adjacent chiral center.\n        *   Therefore, the ring has 5 (distinct CH₂ groups) × 2 (distinct protons per group) = **10 signals**.\n*   **Total signals (Cyclic Product):** 1 (from CH₃) + 2 (from OCH₂) + 10 (from ring) = **13 distinct signals**. This is not among the options. If we make the common (but less rigorous) simplification of counting the two diastereotopic -OCH₂- protons as one signal, we get 1+1+10 = 12 signals (Option C).\n\n**Case 2: Product 4 is the Dimer (from Pathway B)**\n(EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH₂)₅-CH(CN)(COOEt)\n\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a C₂ axis of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group of the pentane chain, assuming free rotation. This means the two halves of the molecule are equivalent.\n*   **Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    1.  **Ethyl groups:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent due to the C₂ symmetry.\n        *   The **CH₃** protons give **1 signal**.\n        *   The **-OCH₂-** protons are diastereotopic due to the adjacent chiral center. This gives **2 signals**.\n    2.  **Methine protons (-CH(CN)):** The two methine protons are equivalent by symmetry. This gives **1 signal**.\n    3.  **Pentane chain (-(CH₂)₅-):** Let's label the carbons C1' to C5' from one side. Due to symmetry, C1' is equivalent to C5', and C2' is equivalent to C4'. C3' is unique.\n        *   **C1'/C5' protons:** These two CH₂ groups are equivalent. The geminal protons on each are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **C2'/C4' protons:** These two CH₂ groups are equivalent. The geminal protons are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **C3' protons:** This single CH₂ group is unique. Its geminal protons are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n*   **Total signals (Dimer Product):** 1 (CH₃) + 2 (-OCH₂) + 1 (-CH) + 2 (C1'/C5') + 2 (C2'/C4') + 2 (C3') = **10 distinct signals**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAnalyzing the cyclic product, which is often the more likely outcome, leads to a total of 13 distinct hydrogen signals based on a strict interpretation of chemical equivalence. This is not an available option. Making a common simplification leads to 12 signals (Option C).\n\nHowever, analyzing the dimer product, which is plausible under certain stoichiometries, and applying the same strict interpretation of chemical equivalence (as suggested by the prompt) leads precisely to 10 distinct signals. This matches option D. Given the discrepancy with the cyclic product, it is most probable that the question intends for the dimer to be the final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product has 10 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\n<<<D>>>"
