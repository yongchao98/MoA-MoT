    "Here is the step-by-step determination of the pH of the final solution.\n\n### 1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant\n\nFirst, we determine the number of moles of the weak acid (CH3COOH), the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl), and the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂).\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ (from strong acid HCl):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻).\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ (from strong base Ba(OH)₂):**\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base and dissociates completely, yielding two moles of OH⁻ for every mole of Ba(OH)₂ (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n### 2. Neutralization Reactions\n\nThe neutralization reactions occur in steps. First, the strong acid reacts with the strong base. Then, any excess strong acid or base will react with the weak component.\n\n*   **Step 2a: Strong Acid-Strong Base Neutralization**\n    *   The 0.080 moles of H⁺ from HCl will react with the OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂.\n    *   Reaction: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Since there are more moles of OH⁻ (0.180 mol) than H⁺ (0.080 mol), all the H⁺ will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Step 2b: Strong Base-Weak Acid Neutralization**\n    *   The remaining 0.100 moles of OH⁻ will react with the 0.050 moles of the weak acid, CH₃COOH.\n    *   Reaction: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   The weak acid (CH₃COOH) is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n    *   This reaction also produces 0.050 moles of the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n\n### 3. Determine the Final Composition and Calculate pH\n\nThe final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH⁻, a strong base. The presence of a strong base will be the primary determinant of the solution's pH.\n\n*   **Total Volume of the Solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the Concentration of Excess OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of remaining OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   The pOH is the negative logarithm of the hydroxide ion concentration.\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is approximately 12.62, which corresponds to a strongly basic solution due to the excess barium hydroxide.\n\n<<<A>>>"
