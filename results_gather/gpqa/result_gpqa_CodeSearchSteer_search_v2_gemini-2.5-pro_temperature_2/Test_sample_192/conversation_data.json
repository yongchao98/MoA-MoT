    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the relationship between the number of stars and distance.\n\n1.  **Define the variables and relationships:**\n    *   Let `N` be the number of stars.\n    *   Let `r` be the distance to the stars.\n    *   Let `plx` be the parallax of the stars.\n    *   The fundamental relationship between distance and parallax is that they are inversely proportional: `plx ∝ 1/r`. This can also be written as `r ∝ 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Interpret the given information:**\n    *   The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". This refers to the number of stars found within a certain small range of parallax values, which can be expressed as a derivative, `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   So, we are given: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n\n3.  **Identify the goal:**\n    *   We need to determine how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance,\" which is the derivative `dN/dr`. We need to find the proportionality between `dN/dr` and `r`.\n\n4.  **Use the chain rule to transform the variables:**\n    *   To find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule of calculus:\n        `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr`\n\n5.  **Calculate the components:**\n    *   First, we need to find the term `d(plx)/dr`. Since `plx = k/r` (where `k` is a constant of proportionality), the derivative is `d(plx)/dr = -k/r²`. When considering the distribution density, we use the absolute value, so the transformation factor (the Jacobian) is proportional to `1/r²`.\n    *   Second, we express the given distribution `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`. We substitute `plx ∝ 1/r` into the given relation:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5`\n\n6.  **Combine the results:**\n    *   Now substitute the components back into the chain rule equation:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r²) `\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance changes in proportion to `r³`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
