    "Here is an analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of the Genetic Data\n\n1.  **Role of Gene G2**: The knockout mutant `g2` shows 0% resistance, a complete loss of function. Furthermore, any double mutant that includes the `g2` knockout (`g1g2` and `g2g3`) also exhibits 0% resistance. When a mutation in one gene (in this case, `g2`) masks the effect of a mutation in another gene, this phenomenon is called epistasis. The `g2` mutation is epistatic to both `g1` and `g3`. This pattern strongly suggests that G2 acts upstream of G1 and G3 in the resistance pathway. A common role for such an upstream gene is a transcription factor that is essential for the entire pathway to function.\n\n2.  **Roles of Genes G1 and G3**:\n    *   The single mutants `g1` and `g3` have partial resistance (75% and 50%, respectively), indicating that both genes are necessary for the full wild-type resistance level of 100%.\n    *   The double mutant `g1g3` has a resistance level of 10%. This phenotype is more severe than either of the single mutants.\n    *   If the genes acted in a simple additive manner, the expected resistance for `g1g3` would be the wild-type resistance minus the loss from each mutant (100% - (100-75%) - (100-50%)) = 25%. The observed resistance is 10%, which is a more severe phenotype than predicted by a simple additive model.\n    *   This \"synergistic\" interaction, where the double mutant phenotype is more severe than the sum of the individual mutant effects, is often indicative of gene redundancy. This means the two genes (G1 and G3) likely have partially overlapping or parallel functions that contribute to the final phenotype (resistance). When one is knocked out, the other can partially compensate, but when both are knocked out, the function is almost completely lost.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** G2 as a transcription factor is plausible. However, there is no evidence for them sharing a promoter, and G3 is not epistatic to G1, as the double mutant `g1g3` (10% resistance) does not have the same phenotype as the `g3` single mutant (50% resistance).\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** \"G2 is a transcription factor\" is the strongest conclusion from the data. \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" is the best explanation for the synergistic effect seen in the `g1g3` double mutant. The last clause, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is incorrect, as the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) does not match the `g1` phenotype (75%). However, this option contains two out of three claims that are very well supported by the experimental data, making it the most likely answer, assuming an error in the final clause of the question's options.\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** The claim that G1 is a transcription factor is incorrect, as the `g2` mutant has a more severe phenotype. There is also no evidence for pleiotropy from this experiment.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** As with option C, there is no data to support the claim of pleiotropy. The claim that G1 is epistatic towards G3 is also incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the conclusion that best fits the experimental data is B, as it correctly identifies the likely role of G2 as a transcription factor and provides the most plausible explanation for the interaction between G1 and G3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
