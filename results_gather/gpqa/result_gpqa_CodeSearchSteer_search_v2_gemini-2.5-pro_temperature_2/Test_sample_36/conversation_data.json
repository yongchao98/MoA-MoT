    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product E, followed by an analysis of its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**: This reaction protects the aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) with 1,2-ethanedithiol (HSCH₂CH₂SH), often abbreviated as EDT. This forms a cyclic dithioacetal called a 1,3-dithiane. The product, **A**, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: n-Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It removes the most acidic proton from compound A, which is the proton on the carbon between the two electron-withdrawing sulfur atoms (C2). This creates a carbanion (a lithiated dithiane), which is a potent nucleophile. Product **B** is the lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane carbanion.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion B attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction. This adds a second ethyl group to the C2 position of the dithiane ring. Product **C** is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: This step removes the dithiane protecting group through hydrolysis, catalyzed by mercuric chloride (HgCl₂). The C2 carbon of the dithiane is converted back into a carbonyl group. Since this carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the resulting product **D** is 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone), (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction.\n    *   First, the Wittig ylide is prepared. Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) to form a phosphonium salt, [(CH₃CH₂)₂CH-P⁺Ph₃]Br⁻.\n    *   Next, BuLi acts as a base, removing the acidic proton from the carbon attached to the phosphorus, yielding the ylide: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   The ylide then reacts with the ketone **D** (3-pentanone). The reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen atom of the ketone with the carbon group from the ylide, forming a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The reaction is: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → **(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂** + Ph₃P=O.\n\nThe final product, **E**, is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n**13C-NMR Analysis of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene:**\n\nTo determine the number of 13C-NMR signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule E, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n\n*   The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a C₂ axis of symmetry that bisects the central C=C double bond.\n*   Because of this symmetry, the two carbons of the double bond (C=C) are chemically equivalent and will produce a single signal.\n*   All four ethyl groups are attached to the double bond in an identical manner. Due to symmetry and rapid rotation around the C-C single bonds on the NMR timescale, all four ethyl groups are equivalent.\n*   Therefore, all four methylene (-CH₂-) carbons are in the same chemical environment, giving one signal.\n*   Similarly, all four methyl (-CH₃) carbons are in the same chemical environment, giving one signal.\n\nCounting the unique carbon environments:\n1.  One signal for the two equivalent carbons of the **C=C** bond.\n2.  One signal for the four equivalent **-CH₂-** carbons.\n3.  One signal for the four equivalent **-CH₃** carbons.\n\nThus, the final product E will produce a total of **3** signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
