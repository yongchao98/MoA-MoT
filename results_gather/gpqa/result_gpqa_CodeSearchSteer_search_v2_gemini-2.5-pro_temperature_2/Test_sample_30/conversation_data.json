    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n### **Step 1: Toluene treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid (Product 1)**\n\nThis reaction is the electrophilic aromatic nitration of toluene. The mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is the electrophile. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an activating group and an *ortho*, *para*-director. This means the nitro group will attach to the positions ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) relative to the methyl group. This reaction yields a mixture of *o*-nitrotoluene and *p*-nitrotoluene, with the para isomer being the major product due to less steric hindrance.\n\n*   **Product 1:** A mixture of *o*-nitrotoluene and *p*-nitrotoluene (major).\n\n### **Step 2: Product 1 treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄ (Product 2)**\n\nThis step involves the oxidation of the methyl group of nitrotoluene. Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) in the presence of sulfuric acid can oxidize activated methyl groups on an aromatic ring, such as the one in nitrotoluene, to an aldehyde. While stronger oxidizing agents might produce a carboxylic acid, oxidation with MnO₂/H₂SO₄ can be controlled to yield the aldehyde. Therefore, *p*-nitrotoluene is oxidized to *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde, and *o*-nitrotoluene is oxidized to *o*-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n\n*   **Product 2:** A mixture of *o*-nitrobenzaldehyde and *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde (major). The next reaction proceeds from this aldehyde.\n\n### **Step 3: Product 2 treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (Product 3)**\n\nThis reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. Acetone is deprotonated by sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-hydrogens to enolize itself). The initial aldol addition product readily dehydrates to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\n*   Starting with the major product from Step 2, *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde, the reaction yields **4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one**. This molecule is also commonly known as *p*-nitrobenzylideneacetone.\n*   Starting with the minor ortho-isomer would result in 4-(2-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one.\n\nGiven that the question leads to a single answer choice, the reaction pathway is assumed to follow the major isomer (*para*).\n\n*   **Product 3:** 4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one.\n\n### **Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group of 4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one, we must identify its symmetry elements.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a para-substituted benzene ring connected to a butenone chain (`-CH=CH-C(O)-CH₃`).\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** Present in all molecules.\n    *   **Axis of Rotation (Cₙ):** There is no rotational axis (C₂ or higher) that would leave the molecule unchanged.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not possess a center of inversion.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule has a single plane of symmetry. This plane contains the benzene ring, the nitro group, the atoms of the double bond (`C=C`), the carbonyl group (`C=O`), and can bisect the methyl group (`-CH₃`). If one C-H bond of the methyl group lies within this plane, the other two hydrogen atoms are positioned symmetrically on either side of it.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nThe ortho-isomer, 4-(2-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one, would lack this plane of symmetry and would belong to the C₁ point group, which is not an option. Therefore, the question implicitly refers to the product derived from the major *para*-nitrotoluene isomer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
