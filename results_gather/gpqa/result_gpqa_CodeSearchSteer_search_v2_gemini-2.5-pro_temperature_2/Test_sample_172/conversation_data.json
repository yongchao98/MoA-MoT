    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\nFirst, we use the position-momentum uncertainty relation:\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\nwhere:\n*   Δx is the uncertainty in position.\n*   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π), approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\nWe are given the uncertainty in the electron's position, Δx = 0.1 nm = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n\nFrom the uncertainty principle, the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is:\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\nΔp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\nNext, we relate the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). For a particle, whether relativistic or not, the relationship can be expressed as:\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle.\n\nGiven the electron's speed v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s, we can now estimate the minimum uncertainty in its energy:\nΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThis value is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nThe calculated value aligns with option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
