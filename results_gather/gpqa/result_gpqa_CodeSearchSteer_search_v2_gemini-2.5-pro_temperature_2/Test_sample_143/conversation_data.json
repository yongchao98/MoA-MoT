    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the mean proper lifetime (τ) of the particle.** The lifetime is inversely proportional to the decay width (Γ) according to the formula:\n    τ = ħ / Γ\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s).\n\n2.  **Calculate the relativistic factors of the particle.** Since the particle is moving at a high energy (E_X = 8 GeV) compared to its mass (m_X = 1.2 GeV), we need to consider time dilation.\n    *   The Lorentz factor (γ) is the ratio of the total energy to the rest mass energy:\n        γ = E_X / m_Xc² = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20/3\n    *   The velocity of the particle (v) is related to the Lorentz factor. We often use β = v/c:\n        β = √(1 - 1/γ²)\n\n3.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (L).** In the laboratory frame, the particle travels a longer distance than in its own rest frame due to its high velocity. The mean decay distance is given by:\n    L = v * γ * τ = (βc) * γ * τ\n\nCombining these steps, we can derive a more direct formula using the product ħc, which is a useful constant in particle physics (ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm).\n\nL = γβ * c * (ħ/Γ) = γβ * (ħc/Γ)\n\nNow, let's plug in the numbers:\n\n1.  **Calculate γβ:**\n    γ = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.67\n    The product γβ can be calculated more directly as γβ = √(γ² - 1).\n    γβ = √((20/3)² - 1) = √(400/9 - 1) = √(391/9) = √(391)/3 ≈ 19.774 / 3 ≈ 6.591\n\n2.  **Calculate L:**\n    We are given:\n    *   Γ_X = 320 MeV\n    *   ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm (where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m)\n\n    L = (√(391)/3) * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\n    L ≈ 6.591 * (0.6166 MeV·fm / MeV)\n    L ≈ 4.064 fm\n\n3.  **Convert to meters:**\n    Since 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m:\n    L ≈ 4.064 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nComparing this calculated value to the given options:\n\n*   A) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\n*   B) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\n*   C) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\n*   D) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nOur calculated value of 4.064 x 10⁻¹⁵ m is extremely close to option D. The minor difference (about 0.25%) is likely due to the precision of the constants used in creating the problem options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
