    "An analysis of each compound determines its potential for optical activity. A compound will be optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic (50/50) mixture of enantiomers.\n\n*   ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, rendering the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n*   ***(3aR,7aS,E*)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors (*R*, *S*, and *E*), designating a single, complex stereoisomer. This compound has multiple chiral centers (at positions 3a and 7a) and its specific configuration prevents the molecule from having a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical activity.\n*   ***(2R,3S)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (*2R,3S*) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that lies between the two chiral carbons. Such a compound is called a *meso* compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. Thus, it is optically inactive.\n*   ***(2R,3R)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the *meso* form above. The (*2R,3R*) configuration lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. Since a specific enantiomer is given, it is not a racemic mixture and will be optically active.\n*   ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This compound has one chiral center at the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1). The paths around the ring from this carbon are different, and the four groups attached to it (H, OH, -CH2-CH=, and -C=CH-CH2-) are distinct. The designation (*R*) indicates a specific enantiomer is present, which is chiral and thus optically active.\n*   ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: Assuming the notation refers to the *all-cis* isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring, the molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. One such plane passes through one hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon atom. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This ketone does not contain any chiral centers. The carbon atom C3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, and no carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are chiral. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group and bisects the isobutyl group and the cyclopentyl ring, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, three of the compounds will exhibit optical activity: (*3aR,7aS,E*)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (*2R,3R*)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, and (*R*)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.\n\n<<<C>>>"
