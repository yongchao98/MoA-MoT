    "To determine which of the listed physical theories does not require regularization at high energies, a review of each is necessary.\n\nRegularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to handle infinities that arise in calculations, particularly those involving high energies (ultraviolet divergences). This process introduces a parameter, known as a regulator or cutoff, to make these calculations finite.\n\n*   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** As the quantum field theory describing how light and matter interact, QED encounters divergent integrals in its calculations. Consequently, it fundamentally requires regularization techniques, like momentum cutoff or dimensional regularization, to yield finite and physically meaningful results.\n\n*   **B) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for superstring theory is to resolve the issues of infinities that plague quantum field theories, especially in the context of quantum gravity. In superstring theory, fundamental particles are not point-like but rather one-dimensional \"strings.\" This extended nature is thought to smooth out interactions at very short distances (high energies), thus naturally avoiding the ultraviolet divergences found in point-particle theories. While some calculations in string theory may use forms of regularization for intermediate steps or to handle other types of divergences (like infrared divergences), it is a central claim of the theory that it is free from the high-energy (UV) divergences that require regularization in standard quantum field theories.\n\n*   **C) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, governed by Maxwell's equations, faces its own problem with infinities, most notably the infinite self-energy of a classical point charge. This issue arises from the energy of the electric field at infinitesimally small distances from the charge. Addressing this problem can be seen as a form of regularization.\n\n*   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** QCD is the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force. Much like QED, its calculations for particle interactions lead to ultraviolet divergences. Therefore, regularization and subsequent renormalization are essential procedures in QCD to make theoretical predictions.\n\nBased on this analysis, Quantum Electrodynamics, Classical Electrodynamics, and Quantum Chromodynamics all encounter infinities that necessitate some form of regularization. Superstring Theory is specifically formulated to be free of the ultraviolet divergences that afflict traditional quantum field theories.\n\n<<<B>>>"
