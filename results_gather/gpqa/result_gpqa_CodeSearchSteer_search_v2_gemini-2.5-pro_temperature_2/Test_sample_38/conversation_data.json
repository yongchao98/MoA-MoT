    "The problem asks for the value of the normalization constant \"a\" for a given wave function, with the condition that the particle is only found in the interval between x=1 and x=3. This is a classic quantum mechanics problem involving the normalization of a wave function.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Wave Function (Ψ):** This is a mathematical description of a quantum state. In this problem, it is given as Ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i.\n2.  **Born's Rule:** According to the Born rule, the probability density of finding a particle at a certain position is given by the square of the magnitude of its wave function, |Ψ(x)|². Since a wave function can be a complex number (like the one in this problem), its magnitude squared is calculated as Ψ*Ψ, where Ψ* is the complex conjugate.\n3.  **Normalization:** The total probability of finding the particle in all possible locations must be equal to 1. This is expressed mathematically by integrating the probability density over the entire space where the particle can exist. In this specific case, the particle is confined to the region 1 < x < 3.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**1. Determine the Probability Density**\n\nFirst, we need to calculate |Ψ(x)|². The wave function is given by:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i\n\nThis is a complex number of the form `u + vi`, where `u = a / sqrt(1+x)` and `v = -0.5`. The magnitude squared, |Ψ(x)|², is `u² + v²`.\n\n|Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**2. Apply the Normalization Condition**\n\nThe problem states the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density over this interval must be 1.\n\n∫₁³ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\nSubstituting the expression for |Ψ(x)|²:\n\n∫₁³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n**3. Solve the Integral**\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n\n∫₁³ (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\n*   **First integral:**\n    a² ∫₁³ (1 / (1 + x)) dx\n    The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x).\n    So, a² [ln(1 + x)] from 1 to 3 = a² (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)) = a² (ln(4) - ln(2)) = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).\n\n*   **Second integral:**\n    ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = [0.25x] from 1 to 3 = 0.25 * 3 - 0.25 * 1 = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5.\n\n**4. Solve for \"a\"**\n\nNow, we substitute the results of the integrals back into the normalization equation:\n\na² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, we solve for \"a\":\n\na² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value for the natural logarithm of 2 (ln(2) ≈ 0.693):\n\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\n\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.8494\n\nThis value is very close to 0.85.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the calculation, the numerical value of \"a\" is approximately 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
