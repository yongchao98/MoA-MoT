    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final answer.\n\n### 1. Identification of the Reactants\n\n*   **The Dienophile (Anhydride):** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride shows a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   The single ¹H peak at 7 ppm indicates two chemically equivalent alkene protons.\n    *   The two ¹³C peaks correspond to two types of carbons: the alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and the carbonyl carbons of the anhydride (~165 ppm). The fact that there are only two signals implies high symmetry.\n    *   The starting material, a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid with these features, is **maleic acid**. Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**. This molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinyl protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, which perfectly matches the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n### 2. The Reaction and Its Products\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   This reaction is stereoselective and typically yields two main products: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   According to the **Alder endo rule**, for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is favored and is therefore the **major product**. The *exo* product, which is often more thermodynamically stable, is the **minor product**.\n*   The molecular formula of the diene is C₉H₁₄ and the dienophile is C₄H₂O₃. The Diels-Alder adduct would have a formula of C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given in the problem.\n\n### 3. Structural Analysis of the Major (*endo*) and Minor (*exo*) Products\n\nThe key difference between the *endo* and *exo* products lies in the relative orientation of the anhydride ring with respect to the bicyclic framework.\n\n*   ***Endo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the new carbon-carbon double bond formed in the reaction. This places the two protons on the anhydride part of the molecule in close proximity to the substituents on that double bond.\n*   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring points \"away\" from the carbon-carbon double bond. The protons on the anhydride part are distant from the substituents on the double bond.\n\n### 4. Interpretation of NMR Data and NOESY Spectrum\n\n**2D NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected through chemical bonds. A cross-peak between two signals indicates spatial proximity. The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one, which means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists only in the *endo* isomer.\n\nLet's assign the proton signals described in the options to the structure of the product:\n\n*   The product has four methyl groups. Two are attached to saturated bridgehead carbons, and two are attached to the alkene carbons.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (`=C-CH₃`). They are deshielded by the double bond.\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring (`-CH-CO-`). They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons. They are in a more shielded environment.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is likely one of the two non-equivalent protons of the `CH₂` bridge in the bicyclic system.\n\nNow, let's consider the spatial relationships in the **major (*endo*) product**:\n\n*   The anhydride protons (**2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**) are positioned directly under the double bond.\n*   This geometry brings them very close to the vinyl methyl groups (**6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**). This close proximity will generate a strong NOE cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum.\n*   In contrast, in the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride ring and its protons point away from the double bond and its methyl groups. They are far apart in space, so no NOE cross-peak would be observed between them.\n\nThis analysis perfectly explains why a cross-peak would be present in the major product and absent in the minor one.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe cross-peak that differentiates the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) products connects the protons that are brought into close proximity only in the *endo* conformation. These are the protons of the anhydride bridge and the protons of the vinyl methyl groups.\n\nTherefore, the two resonances connected by the specific cross-peak are the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** and the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm -> Interaction between bridgehead methyl and CH₂ bridge proton. Possible, but not unique to *endo*.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm -> Interaction between bridgehead methyl and vinyl methyl. These are too far apart.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> Interaction between vinyl methyl and anhydride proton. This is the key *endo*-specific interaction.\nD) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> Interaction between CH₂ bridge proton and anhydride proton. This interaction also exists in the *endo* product but the one described in C is the classic textbook example for distinguishing these isomers and involves a larger number of protons (6H vs 1H).\n\nBased on the analysis, option C is the most definitive and correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
