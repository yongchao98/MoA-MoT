    "Here is a detailed analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatographic observations.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The first step is the reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene, a *trans*-alkene, with *meta*-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA). This is a stereospecific *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond. Epoxidation of a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the alkene is planar and achiral, the mCPBA can attack from either the top or bottom face, producing a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane. This mixture is a racemic mixture.\n\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The second step is the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the epoxide. This reaction proceeds via an S_N2-like mechanism with *anti*-addition. The incoming nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   Opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has two chiral centers but also possesses an internal plane of symmetry. A compound with chiral centers that is achiral overall is called a **meso compound**. Thus, Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral meso compound.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene, with mCPBA results in a *cis*-epoxide. Because of the *cis* geometry, the resulting epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, has a plane of symmetry and is a meso compound. Since it's achiral, only one epoxide product is formed.\n\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The acid-catalyzed opening of this meso-epoxide also proceeds with *anti*-addition. The nucleophilic attack by water can occur at either of the two epoxide carbons.\n    *   Attack at one carbon results in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon results in its enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    Since the starting epoxide is achiral, the product must be optically inactive, meaning the two enantiomers are produced in equal amounts. This results in a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n*   **From Reaction 1:** meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n*   **From Reaction 2:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\nThe meso-compound is a diastereomer of the other two compounds, which are enantiomers of each other.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe combined product mixture is analyzed using two types of HPLC.\n\n**1. Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   An achiral HPLC column cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment, and therefore, they elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated on a standard achiral column.\n*   Consequently, the racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol will elute as one peak. The meso-(4R,5S)-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will have a different retention time and will appear as a separate peak.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   The chiral environment of the column causes enantiomers to have different interactions with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n*   In this case, all three stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved:\n    1.  meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n    3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>"
