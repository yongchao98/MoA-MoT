    "The less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome (47,XXY) compared to Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21) are primarily due to a dosage compensation mechanism that inactivates most of the genes on the extra X chromosome. This process, known as X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), is a complex epigenetic phenomenon involving modifications to the chromatin structure.\n\nKey aspects of this mechanism include:\n*   **X-Inactivation:** In individuals with more than one X chromosome, all but one are epigenetically silenced early in embryonic development to equalize the dosage of X-linked genes between males (XY) and females (XX). In Klinefelter's syndrome, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated in each cell, similar to the process in females. This prevents a massive overexpression of genes from the supernumerary X chromosome. In contrast, there is no equivalent mechanism to silence the entire extra chromosome 21 in Down's syndrome, leading to a more severe phenotype due to the over-expression of a larger number of genes.\n*   **Chromatin Modification:** X-inactivation is achieved through layers of epigenetic modifications that alter chromatin structure. Histone modifications are among the earliest changes, with specific types of methylation (like H3K9 and H3K27 methylation) playing a crucial role in silencing the chromosome. Histone methyltransferases are the enzymes responsible for this methylation. Subsequent modifications, such as DNA methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions, help to stably maintain the inactive state. This entire process leads to the formation of a condensed, transcriptionally silent structure known as a Barr body.\n*   **Incomplete Inactivation:** It is important to note that not all genes on the extra X chromosome are silenced. Approximately 15% of X-linked genes \"escape\" inactivation, and their continued expression from the extra X chromosome is thought to contribute to the specific traits seen in Klinefelter's syndrome, such as tall stature and gonadal dysfunction.\n\nConsidering the options provided:\n*   A and B describe events during meiosis that can *cause* aneuploidy but do not explain the differing severity *after* fertilization.\n*   D relates to DNA replication, which is not the primary mechanism for dosage compensation.\n*   C directly addresses the post-zygotic epigenetic mechanism of gene silencing. Chromatin methylation by enzymes like histone methyltransferases is a core component of X-chromosome inactivation, which effectively compensates for the extra X chromosome, thus mitigating the phenotypic severity of Klinefelter's syndrome.\n\nTherefore, chromatin methylation in the post-zygotic stage is the correct molecular explanation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
