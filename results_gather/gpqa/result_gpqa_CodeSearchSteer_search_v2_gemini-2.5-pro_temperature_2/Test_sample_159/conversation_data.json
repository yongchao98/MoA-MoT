    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture's Shape**: The problem describes an N-sided polygon where all apothems (the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side) are equal, and the number of sides, N, approaches infinity. A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides is geometrically a circle. The apothem `a` of the polygon becomes the radius `r` of the circle.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physics**: When monochromatic light passes through an aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern. Since the observation is in the \"far field region,\" this is a classic case of Fraunhofer diffraction. The specific pattern for a circular aperture is called an Airy pattern. This pattern features a bright central spot, known as the Airy disk, surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to intensity minima.\n\n3.  **Locate the Minima**: The angular positions of the minima in the Airy pattern are determined by the zeros of a specific mathematical function (the Bessel function of the first kind). The formula for the angular position of the first minimum (the first dark ring) is well-established.\n\n4.  **Apply the Formula**: For a circular aperture, the angle `θ` of the first minimum is given by the formula:\n    sin(θ) = 1.22 λ / d\n\n    *   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n    *   `d` is the diameter of the circular aperture.\n\n5.  **Use the Problem's Variables**:\n    *   As established in step 1, the apothem `a` of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle, so `r = a`.\n    *   The diameter `d` is twice the radius, so `d = 2r = 2a`.\n    *   The problem states that the angles are small, so the `tan(θ) ≈ θ` approximation is valid, which also implies `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Position of the First Minimum**: Substitute `d = 2a` into the formula:\n    θ₁ = 1.22 * λ / (2a)\n    θ₁ = 0.610 * λ / a\n\n7.  **Interpret the Question**: The question asks for \"the angular distance between the first two minima.\" This phrasing can be ambiguous.\n    *   **Interpretation A**: It could mean the angular position of the first minimum relative to the central maximum (at θ=0). This distance is simply `θ₁`.\n    *   **Interpretation B**: It could mean the angular separation between the first dark ring and the second dark ring (`θ₂ - θ₁`).\n\n8.  **Evaluate Both Interpretations**:\n    *   **Interpretation A** yields `θ₁ = 0.610 * λ / a`. This matches one of the options perfectly. The angular position of the first minimum defines the size of the central bright Airy disk and is a fundamental quantity in diffraction-limited optics.\n    *   For **Interpretation B**, we would need the position of the second minimum, which occurs at approximately `sin(θ₂) ≈ 2.233 * λ / d`.\n        *   `θ₂ ≈ 2.233 * λ / (2a) = 1.1165 * λ / a`.\n        *   The distance between the two minima would be `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1165 - 0.610) * λ / a = 0.5065 * λ / a`. This value corresponds to option C.\n\n9.  **Conclusion**: Both interpretations lead to answers present in the options. However, the most common and fundamental quantity asked for in such problems is the angular position of the first minimum itself, which represents the angular radius of the central Airy disk. This quantity (`θ₁`) is what limits the resolution of optical instruments according to the Rayleigh criterion. Therefore, Interpretation A is the most probable intent of the question.\n\nThe angular distance of the first minimum from the center is `0.610 λ / a`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
