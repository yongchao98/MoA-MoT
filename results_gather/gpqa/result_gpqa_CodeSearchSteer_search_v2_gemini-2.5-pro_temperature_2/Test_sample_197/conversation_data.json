    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we first need to calculate the fraction of each cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe relevant equilibria for the formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are:\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺; with the overall stability constant β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]; with the overall stability constant β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻; with the overall stability constant β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻; with the overall stability constant β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ions and all the complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the stability constants, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], is the concentration of the complex divided by the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nBy canceling [Co²⁺] from the numerator and the denominator, we get:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nGiven that the total cobalt concentration (c(Co) = 10⁻² M) is significantly lower than the thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M), we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium to be equal to its initial concentration, [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M.\n\nNow, we can substitute the known values into the equation:\nLet's first calculate the denominator (D):\nD = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNext, we calculate the numerator (N) for the α₂ fraction:\nN = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n\nFinally, we calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = N / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
