    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let `v1` be the velocity of the first astronaut (mass 2m) and `v2` be the velocity of the second astronaut (mass 3m), both measured in the same inertial frame of reference.\n\n*   **Given velocities:**\n    *   v1 = 0.6c\n    *   v2 = 0.5c\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity of astronaut 2 as observed by astronaut 1 is:\n\n`v_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\n*   **Plugging in the values:**\n    *   `v_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n    *   `v_rel = -0.1c / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n    *   `v_rel = -0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n    *   `v_rel = -0.1c / 0.7`\n    *   `v_rel ≈ -0.1428c`\n\nThe magnitude of the relative speed is approximately `0.14c`. The negative sign indicates that from the perspective of the faster astronaut (v1), the slower astronaut (v2) appears to be moving backward.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Total Energy of the System (E)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic system is the sum of the total energies of its individual components. The total energy `E` of a single particle is given by the formula `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe Lorentz factor `γ` is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n\n*   **Energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n    *   Mass (m1) = 2m\n    *   Velocity (v1) = 0.6c\n    *   `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n    *   `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5mc^2`\n\n*   **Energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n    *   Mass (m2) = 3m\n    *   Velocity (v2) = 0.5c\n    *   `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n    *   `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 3.464mc^2`\n\n*   **Total energy of the system (E_total):**\n    *   `E_total = E1 + E2`\n    *   `E_total = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2`\n    *   `E_total = 5.964mc^2`\n\nRounding the total energy gives us `5.96mc^2`.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96mc^2**. Comparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n*   B) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n*   C) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n*   D) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe correct choice is B, which matches our calculations.\n\n<<<B>>>"
