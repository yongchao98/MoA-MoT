    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we must first identify the energy of the transition from the molecule's fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The calculation involves the quantum rotation-vibration model.\n\n### 1. Defining the States and Transition\n*   **Fundamental State (Ground State):** In the rotation-vibration model, the energy of a state is given by E(v,J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B*J(J+1), where 'v' is the vibrational quantum number and 'J' is the rotational quantum number. The ground state has the lowest possible quantum numbers, which are v=0 and J=0.\n*   **Next Lowest Energy State:** The next state is achieved by increasing either 'v' or 'J'. For a photon-induced transition in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule (like X-Y with different masses), the selection rules are Δv = ±1 and ΔJ = ±1. Starting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the lowest energy allowed transition is a rovibrational transition to the state v=1, J=1.\n*   **Energy of the Transition (ΔE):** The energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between these two states.\n    *   Initial state energy: E_initial = E(0,0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B*0(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n    *   Final state energy: E_final = E(1,1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B*1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n    *   The energy difference is: ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + 2B.\n\n### 2. Calculation Steps\nWe need to calculate the vibrational energy contribution (ħω) and the rotational energy contribution (2B).\n\n**a) Calculate the Reduced Mass (μ):**\nThe reduced mass simplifies the two-body problem to a one-body problem.\nμ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n*   Mx = 20 amu\n*   My = 2 amu\nμ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu\nConverting to kg: μ ≈ 1.8182 amu * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg.\n\n**b) Calculate the Moment of Inertia (I):**\nThe moment of inertia represents the molecule's resistance to rotational motion.\nI = μ * R²\n*   R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\nI = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n**c) Calculate the Rotational Constant (B):**\nThe rotational constant relates to the energy levels of the rotational motion.\nB = ħ² / (2 * I)\n*   ħ (reduced Planck's constant) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\nB = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 4.60 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n**d) Calculate the Total Transition Energy (ΔE):**\nNow, we can find the total energy required for the transition.\n*   ΔE_vibrational = ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   ΔE_rotational = 2B = 2 * (4.60 x 10⁻²³ J) = 9.20 x 10⁻²³ J\nΔE_total = ΔE_vibrational + ΔE_rotational = (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.20 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 4.2161 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n*(Note that the rotational energy contribution is very small compared to the vibrational energy contribution).*\n\n### 3. Calculate Photon Momentum (p)\nThe energy and momentum of a photon are related by the equation E = pc.\np = E / c\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\np = (4.2161 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) p = 2.3*10⁻²⁷ N·s\nB) p = 1.4*10⁻²⁸ N·s\nC) p = 1.1*10⁻²⁷ N·s\nD) p = 1.9*10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThe calculated value of 1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s is a very close match to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
