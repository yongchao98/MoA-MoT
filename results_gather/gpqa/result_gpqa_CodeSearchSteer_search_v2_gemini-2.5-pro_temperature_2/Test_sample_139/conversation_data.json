    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of Substance B is given as very close to 277 K, which is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This makes D₂O the most probable identity for Substance B.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G and Gas W:** Precipitate G releases substance B (D₂O) upon heating, which means G is a deuterated hydroxide or a similar compound that contains deuterium and oxygen. Gas W, released during the reaction of X and Y, has a molecule with an equal number of neutrons and protons. Given that D₂O is involved, a likely candidate for Gas W is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, satisfying the condition.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope and reacts with liquid Y to produce D₂ (W) and a precipitate (G) that yields D₂O. The \"close analog\" of X is a common reagent in organic chemistry. This points to Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄), a powerful and common reducing agent. Consequently, Substance X must be its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄). The violent reaction described would be between LiAlD₄ (Substance X) and heavy water, D₂O (Liquid Y). The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂. The precipitate G would be a mix of lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), which upon heating would release D₂O.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Identity of X with the Final Clue:** The reaction of a keto acid (containing a ketone and a carboxylic acid) with Substance X (LiAlD₄) results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄, and therefore LiAlD₄, is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. The reaction R-CO-R'-COOH + LiAlD₄ → R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂(OH) produces a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms, confirming this identification.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄.\n    *   **Constituent elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (of which Deuterium, D, is the isotope present).\n    *   **Lightest and heaviest elements:** The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1), and the heaviest is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   **The calculation directive is:** \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   This is interpreted as summing the total mass of all atoms of the lightest element and the total mass of all atoms of the heaviest element present in the LiAlD₄ molecule.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of the hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D). The approximate atomic mass of Deuterium is 2 amu.\n        Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 amu = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains one atom of Aluminum (Al). The approximate atomic mass of Aluminum is 27 amu.\n        Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 amu = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass:** 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
