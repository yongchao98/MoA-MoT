    "### Analysis of Components\n\nA detailed analysis of the 1H NMR spectra for each potential compound confirms the initial deductions. The molecular formula for all the tetramethylbenzene isomers and 1,4-diethylbenzene is C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it presents one singlet for the two aromatic protons and one singlet for the twelve protons of the four equivalent methyl groups. Spectral data shows a signal at 6.888 ppm for the aromatic protons and 2.182 ppm for the methyl groups.\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry, resulting in two equivalent aromatic protons which appear as a single singlet (around 6.88 ppm). The four methyl groups are divided into two equivalent sets, producing two distinct singlets in the aliphatic region (around 2.17 ppm and 2.24 ppm). The integration ratio of these two aliphatic signals is 6H:6H or 1:1.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This isomer lacks the symmetry of the others. It has two non-equivalent aromatic protons and three sets of non-equivalent methyl groups. This would lead to two signals in the aromatic region and three signals in the aliphatic region for this compound alone.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** The spectrum for this compound shows a singlet for the four equivalent aromatic protons. In the aliphatic region, it displays a quartet for the methylene (-CH2-) protons and a triplet for the methyl (-CH3) protons of the ethyl groups, which contradicts the problem's description of only having singlets in this region.\n\n### Mixture Analysis\n\nGiven that the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture exhibits two singlets in the aromatic region and three singlets in the aliphatic region, we can deduce the composition of the mixture by combining the spectral properties of the individual compounds.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The presence of two singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio suggests that each compound in the mixture contributes one singlet, and these singlets originate from an equal number of protons.\n    *   Both 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene produce a single aromatic singlet corresponding to 2 protons each. When mixed, they would show two distinct singlets of equal intensity. This matches the observed data.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The spectrum shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides a single singlet for its 12 methyl protons.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides two singlets, each corresponding to 6 methyl protons.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, the combined signals would be one from durene (relative intensity 12H) and two from prehnitene (relative intensity 6H each). This results in three singlets with an intensity ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This is a perfect match with the experimental data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only combination that produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene shows a quartet and a triplet.\n*   **Option B** is incorrect because the combination would result in three aromatic signals.\n*   **Option D** is incorrect as it would also lead to three aromatic signals.\n\nTherefore, the correct pair of compounds is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
