    "The observations provided for the synthesized peptidic compound point to a specific conclusion when analyzed systematically.\n\n1.  **NMR Data**: The Â¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. Since these peaks have roughly equal integrals that sum to the expected value of one proton, it indicates the proton exists in two different chemical environments in a nearly 1:1 ratio. The possibility of spin-spin coupling has been ruled out.\n2.  **LC-MS Data**: The LC-MS analysis confirms the presence of two distinct species, as shown by the two separate peaks of equal intensity. Crucially, both peaks yield the same mass spectrum, which matches that of the expected molecule. This rules out impurities like a precursor (D) or a 'double coupling' product (A), both of which would have a different mass.\n3.  **Evaluating Stereoisomers**:\n    *   **Enantiomers (B)** are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, enantiomers have identical physical properties and are indistinguishable by techniques like normal LC or NMR spectroscopy. To separate them, chiral chromatography or chiral NMR shift reagents would be necessary, which were not specified. Therefore, a mixture of enantiomers would appear as a single peak in both the LC and NMR analyses.\n    *   **Diastereomers (C)** are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties. Consequently, they can be separated by standard chromatographic techniques like LC and will exhibit different chemical shifts in an NMR spectrum. The observation of two LC peaks and two NMR signals for the same proton is consistent with the presence of a pair of diastereomers.\n\n**The Origin of Diastereomers in Peptides**\n\nIn peptidic compounds, two common phenomena can give rise to diastereomers:\n*   **Epimerization**: If the peptide has multiple chiral centers, racemization at one of these centers during synthesis creates an epimer, which is a type of diastereomer.\n*   **Rotational Isomers (Atropisomers/Rotamers)**: The amide bond (C-N) in a peptide has significant double-bond character due to resonance, which restricts free rotation. This restriction can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers around the amide bond. These rotational isomers are a specific type of diastereomer. They exist in equilibrium, and the energy barrier to their interconversion is often high enough that they can be observed as separate species on the NMR and even chromatography time scales. This phenomenon is particularly well-documented for peptides and is known to cause signal doubling in NMR spectra. The observation of two distinct species at elevated temperatures in the LC-MS further supports this, as it indicates a significant energy barrier between the two isomeric forms.\n\nGiven that the compound is peptidic and all analytical data point towards two distinct species with the same mass but different physical properties, the most logical explanation is the presence of a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
