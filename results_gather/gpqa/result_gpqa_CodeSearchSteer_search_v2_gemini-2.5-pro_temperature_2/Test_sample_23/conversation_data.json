    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   This percentage corresponds to a molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon of 2:1, which can be seen by the calculation: (2 * 1.008) / (1 * 12.011 + 2 * 1.008) ≈ 0.143, or more simply with approximate masses, 12 / (6*12 + 12*1) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n    *   This implies a general formula of CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Since substance Z is saturated (it does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent, it must be a cycloalkane. The most common CₙH₂ₙ cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions:**\n    *   Both mixture X and mixture Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, yield only cyclohexane (Z). This indicates that all component compounds in both mixtures are built on a C₆ carbon skeleton.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane. Since Y contains cyclohexane, the other component of Y must also be a C₆ compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only cyclohexane. This means both unsaturated compounds in X must have a C₆ skeleton and their double bonds are saturated to form cyclohexane.\n\n3.  **Characterize Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids and does not decolorize bromine water. This suggests the components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   We know one component is cyclohexane (Z, C₆H₁₂).\n    *   The other component must be a C₆ compound that is saturated or aromatic and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Benzene (C₆H₆) fits this description perfectly. Under severe conditions, benzene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Benzene is significantly less reactive than alkenes and does not readily decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation reaction. In the context of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation catalysts like platinum, this points to a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules are hydrogenated while others are dehydrogenated.\n    *   We have the equimolar reaction: X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆.\n    *   This is a known type of reaction, for example, cyclohexene can disproportionate to cyclohexane and benzene. In our case, one component of X is hydrogenated to cyclohexane, and the other is dehydrogenated to benzene.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in X:**\n    *   Based on the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation.\n    *   The reaction is `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`.\n    *   We can balance the hydrogen atoms: Total H atoms in reactants = Total H atoms in products.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\n6.  **Verify the Composition of Mixture X:**\n    *   Let the compounds in mixture X be X₁ and X₂. We know they are unsaturated (decolorize bromine water) C₆ cyclic compounds, there are no conjugated double bonds, and together they have 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   To get 18 hydrogens, possible formulas could be C₆H₁₀ and C₆H₈.\n    *   C₆H₁₀ corresponds to a cyclohexene. Cyclohexene is a liquid and has one double bond.\n    *   C₆H₈ corresponds to a cycloalkadiene. The problem specifies no conjugated multiple bonds, so this would be a non-conjugated diene like 1,4-cyclohexadiene. 1,4-Cyclohexadiene is a liquid at room temperature.\n    *   So, a possible composition for X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Let's check the disproportionation: C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆. In this reaction, the diene (C₆H₈) is dehydrogenated to benzene (losing 2H), and the monoene (C₆H₁₀) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (gaining 2H). This is a plausible hydrogen transfer.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This confirms the calculation from step 5.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
