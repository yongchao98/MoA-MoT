    "Here is an analysis of the reagents for the two reactions:\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The nucleophile, cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate. To obtain the final product, this intermediate must be protonated to form the hydroxyl (-OH) group. Reagent A must provide this proton. An acid, represented by H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion), serves as the necessary proton source. While the reaction is often carried out at a slightly basic pH to ensure the presence of free cyanide ions, an acid is required for the protonation step to yield the cyanohydrin. Therefore, H₃O⁺ is the appropriate choice for reagent A.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis transformation is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This reaction can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base. The process involves heating the nitrile with the catalyst in an aqueous solution. Comparing the options, HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a common reagent for this type of hydrolysis. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and would not be effective in catalyzing the reaction to completion under typical conditions. Therefore, the strong acid HCl is the suitable reagent for B.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A** should be **H₃O⁺**.\n*   **B** should be **HCl**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
