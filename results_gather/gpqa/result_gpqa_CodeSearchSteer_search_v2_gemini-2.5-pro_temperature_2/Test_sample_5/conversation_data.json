    "To find the energy spectrum for the given potential, we first need to express the potential in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nThe transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr² = x² + y²\n\nSubstitute these into the potential equation:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(r cos(θ))²\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 kx²\n\nNow, group the terms with x² and y²:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = (4/2 k)x² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThis potential is the sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction:\nV(x, y) = V(x) + V(y)\nwhere:\nV(x) = 1/2 (4k)x² = 1/2 k_x x²\nV(y) = 1/2 k y² = 1/2 k_y y²\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with potential V(q) = 1/2 k'q² are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency ω = sqrt(k'/m).\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction, the effective spring constant is k_x = 4k. The angular frequency is:\nω_x = sqrt(k_x/m) = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\nThe energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are:\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction, the spring constant is k_y = k. The angular frequency is:\nω_y = sqrt(k_y/m) = sqrt(k/m)\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies for the independent x and y motions:\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (n_x + 1/2) * 2ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)]ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2]ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
