    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a defined axis of oscillation like a spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, provided its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. The behavior of such a system is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism.\n\n**Analysis of Radiated Power:**\n\n*   **Angular Distribution:** The power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) by an oscillating electric dipole is not uniform in all directions. It follows the relationship `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`, where θ is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis in this case). This means the power is zero along the axis of oscillation (θ = 0°) and reaches its maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis (θ = 90°), as `sin²(90°) = 1`. The maximum radiated power per unit solid angle is therefore `A ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`.\n*   **Power at θ = 30°:** To find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of 30°, we calculate `sin²(30°)`. Since `sin(30°) = 1/2`, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`. Therefore, the power radiated at 30° is 1/4 of the maximum power, A.\n*   **Wavelength Dependence:** The total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of its oscillation frequency (ω⁴). Since frequency and wavelength (λ) are inversely related (ω ∝ 1/λ), the power is proportional to `1/λ⁴`, or `λ⁻⁴`. This strong dependence on wavelength is famously responsible for Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue. The power per unit solid angle, f, will also have this `λ⁻⁴` dependence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at an angle `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The function `f` for the radiated power per unit solid angle depends on the wavelength as **`λ⁻⁴`**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
