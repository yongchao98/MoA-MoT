    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** The presence of a peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of about one-third of the molecular ion peak is a distinct isotopic signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n\nAll four potential options have a chemical formula of C₇H₅ClO₂, which corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid that is engaged in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\nThis evidence strongly suggests the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates phenyl chloroformate (an ester/acid chloride) and 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (a phenol and aldehyde). Both 4-chlorobenzoic acid and 2-chlorobenzoic acid are carboxylic acids and would be consistent with this IR data.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield, appearing as a singlet, is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, points specifically to a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group deshields the ortho protons, shifting them further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine are slightly less deshielded (7.72 ppm).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the combined spectral data:\n*   The mass spectrum indicates a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   The IR spectrum confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the carboxylic acid proton and shows a *para*-substitution pattern on the aromatic ring.\n\nOnly **4-chlorobenzoic acid** fits all of these criteria. The ¹H NMR for 2-chlorobenzoic acid would show a more complex pattern with four distinct signals for the aromatic protons, which contradicts the observed spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
