    "To identify the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, one must find the mutation that most severely disrupts the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is typically achieved by a mutation that prevents the formation of a complete, functional protein.\n\n### Analysis of Mutations\n\nThe original gene begins with the sequence `5’-ATG TTT CTC...`, which codes for the amino acids Methionine-Phenylalanine-Leucine. To inactivate the gene, the most effective mutations are those that cause a \"knockout\" of protein function. In terms of severity, mutations can be ranked as follows:\n1.  **Nonsense and Frameshift Mutations:** These are the most severe.\n    *   A **nonsense mutation** introduces a premature stop codon, which terminates protein synthesis, leading to a truncated and usually nonfunctional protein.\n    *   A **frameshift mutation** (an insertion or deletion of nucleotides not in a multiple of three) alters the entire downstream reading frame of the gene. This scrambles the subsequent amino acid sequence and often leads to a premature stop codon, resulting in a non-functional protein.\n2.  **Missense Mutation:** This type of mutation leads to the substitution of one amino acid for another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, depending on how critical the changed amino acid is for the protein's structure and function. It is generally less likely to cause a complete knockout than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n3.  **Silent (Synonymous) Mutation:** This mutation changes the DNA sequence but does not change the resulting amino acid. It is the least likely to have any effect on protein function.\n\n### Evaluating the Mutants\n\n*   **Intact gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\n    *   **Codons:** ATG (Start-Met), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu)\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   **Codons:** ATG (Met), TTC (Phe), TAC (Tyr)\n    *   **Analysis:** This represents a missense mutation where Leucine (CTC) has been changed to Tyrosine (TAC). This might affect protein function but does not guarantee it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   **Codons:** ATG (Met), TTC (Phe), TAA (Stop)\n    *   **Analysis:** This mutation introduces a premature stop codon (`TAA`) at the third position. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause translation to halt, producing a useless dipeptide (Met-Phe). This is extremely likely to eliminate the protein's function and, consequently, the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The written sequence is ambiguous, but the most likely interpretation in the context of common mutations is either a missense mutation (`CTC` -> `TAC`) or a frameshift. If it's a frameshift, it would also be highly disruptive. However, the evidence for a frameshift is less clear than the evidence for the stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** This appears to involve multiple changes, including a missense mutation (`CTC` -> `TAC`, Leu -> Tyr). Like Mutant 1, the effect is uncertain.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMutant 2 is the most unambiguous and definitive candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. The introduction of a premature stop codon (`TAA`) very early in the sequence ensures that a functional protein will not be produced.\n\n<<<C>>>"
