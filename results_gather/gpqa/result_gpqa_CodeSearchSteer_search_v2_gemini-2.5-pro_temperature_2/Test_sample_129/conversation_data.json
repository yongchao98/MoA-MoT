    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds so they can be detected by optical ground-based telescopes, we must first determine the shortest wavelength of light that can pass through Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe Lyman-alpha (Ly-α) transition of neutral hydrogen occurs at a specific wavelength of approximately 1216 Ångstroms (Å), or 121.6 nanometers (nm). This wavelength falls within the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Earth's atmosphere, primarily due to ozone, is opaque to most UV radiation. Ground-based telescopes can only detect light at wavelengths that fall within the \"atmospheric window.\"\n\nThe atmospheric cutoff in the ultraviolet is approximately 300 to 350 nm (3000 to 3500 Å). For a spectral line to be detectable from the ground, its observed wavelength must be redshifted to be longer than this cutoff. Using the more conservative lower limit of the atmospheric window, 3500 Å, is a safe estimate for detectability.\n\nThe redshift (z) is calculated using the formula:\n*z = (λ_observed / λ_emitted) - 1*\n\nWhere:\n*   **λ_emitted** is the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line, ~1216 Å.\n*   **λ_observed** is the wavelength detected on Earth, which must be greater than the atmospheric cutoff of ~3500 Å.\n\nTo find the lower limit on the redshift, we set the observed wavelength to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength:\n*z = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1*\n*z ≈ 2.88 - 1*\n*z ≈ 1.88*\n\nThis calculation shows that the Lyman-alpha line needs to be redshifted to at least z ≈ 1.9 to become visible to ground-based optical telescopes. One source mentions specifically that direct ground-based observations of neutral hydrogen via the Lyman-alpha transition are restricted to redshifts of z ≳ 1.7. This aligns with our calculation. Therefore, among the given options, 1.9 is the best estimate for the lower limit.\n\n<<<B>>>"
