    "### Calculating the Equivalent Exoplanet Radius for a Starspot-Induced Signal\n\nTo determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce a light curve signal of the same amplitude as a star with a spotted hemisphere, we must first calculate the brightness variation caused by the starspots and then equate it to the dimming caused by a planetary transit.\n\n#### Starspot Variability\n\nThe variation in the star's brightness is due to its rotation, which alternately reveals a brighter, unspotted hemisphere and a dimmer, spotted hemisphere. The amplitude of this variation can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy radiated per unit area of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (Teff).\n\nGiven:\n*   Star's effective temperature (Teff): 6000K\n*   Spot temperature: 6000K - 1000K = 5000K\n*   Spot filling factor on one hemisphere: 20% (or 0.20)\n\nThe maximum flux (F_max) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The minimum flux (F_min) occurs when the spotted hemisphere, with 20% of its area covered by cooler spots, faces the observer. The relative amplitude of this variation is given by:\n\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nThis simplifies to an expression dependent on the filling factor (`f`) and the temperatures of the star (`T_star`) and spots (`T_spot`):\n\nAmplitude = `f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nAmplitude = `0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\nAmplitude = `0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\nAmplitude ≈ `0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)`\nAmplitude ≈ `0.20 * 0.51775`\nAmplitude ≈ `0.10355`\n\nThis means the star's brightness varies by approximately 10.36% due to the rotating spotted region.\n\n#### Equivalent Exoplanet Transit\n\nAn exoplanet transiting its star causes a dip in brightness proportional to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The amplitude of this transit signal is:\n\nAmplitude_planet = (R_planet / R_star)²\n\nWhere `R_planet` is the planet's radius and `R_star` is the star's radius.\n\n#### Equating the Signals\n\nTo find the exoplanet size that mimics the starspot signal, we set the two amplitudes equal to each other:\n\n(R_planet / R_star)² = 0.10355\n\nSolving for the relative radius (R_planet / R_star):\n\nR_planet / R_star = √0.10355\nR_planet / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis result indicates that a hypothetical exoplanet with a radius of approximately 0.32 times the radius of its host star would produce a transit signal with the same amplitude as the variation caused by the described starspots. This value matches the provided option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
