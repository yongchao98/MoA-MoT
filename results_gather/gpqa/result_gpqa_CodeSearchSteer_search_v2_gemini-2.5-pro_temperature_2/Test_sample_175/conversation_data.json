    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Operators**\n\n*   **Initial State (`|ψ⟩`):** The state of the system is given by the column matrix `[-1, 2, 1]`.\n*   **Operator P:** The matrix for the observable P is:\n    ```\n    P = [[0,   1/√2, 0],\n         [1/√2, 0,   1/√2],\n         [0,   1/√2, 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Operator Q:** The matrix for the observable Q is:\n    ```\n    Q = [[1, 0,  0],\n         [0, 0,  0],\n         [0, 0, -1]]\n    ```\n\n**2. Normalize the Initial State**\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the state vector `|ψ⟩`. The norm squared is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`.\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\nThe norm is `√6`.\nThe normalized state, `|ψ_norm⟩`, is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n\n**3. Find the Eigenvector of P for the Eigenvalue 0**\n\nWe are interested in the measurement of P yielding the value 0. This means the system collapses into the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Let's find this eigenvector `|p₀⟩`.\nWe need to solve `(P - λI)v = 0` for `λ = 0`.\n`P * v = 0`\n```\n[[0,   1/√2, 0],\n [1/√2, 0,   1/√2],\n [0,   1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z] = [0, 0, 0]\n```\nThis gives us two equations:\n1.  `y/√2 = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0` => `x = -z`\n\nSo, the eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. We choose `x=1` to get `[1, 0, -1]`.\nNow, we normalize this eigenvector:\nThe norm squared is `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`. The norm is `√2`.\nThe normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 of P, `|p₀⟩`, is:\n`|p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability of Measuring P = 0**\n\nThe probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 for P is the squared magnitude of the projection of the normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩` onto the eigenvector `|p₀⟩`.\n`Prob(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n`⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩` is the inner product of `|p₀⟩` and `|ψ_norm⟩`.\n`⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]] ⋅ [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]]`\n`⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\nNow, we square this value to get the probability:\n`Prob(P=0) = (-1/√3)² = 1/3`\n\n**5. Determine the State After Measuring P = 0**\n\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector, `|p₀⟩`.\nThe new state of the system, `|ψ'⟩`, is:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n\n**6. Find the Eigenvector of Q for the Eigenvalue -1**\n\nNext, we measure the observable Q and want to find the probability of getting -1. We need the eigenvector of Q corresponding to the eigenvalue -1.\nSince Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries (1, 0, -1), and the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\nThe eigenvector for the eigenvalue -1 of Q, `|q₋₁⟩`, is:\n`|q₋₁⟩ = [0, 0, 1]`\n\n**7. Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q = -1**\n\nThe probability of measuring Q = -1 is the squared magnitude of the projection of the new state `|ψ'⟩` onto the eigenvector `|q₋₁⟩`.\n`Prob(Q=-1 | after P=0) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²`\n`⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩` is the inner product of `|q₋₁⟩` and `|ψ'⟩`.\n`⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] ⋅ [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]]`\n`⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2`\nThe probability is the square of this value:\n`Prob(Q=-1 | after P=0) = (-1/√2)² = 1/2`\n\n**8. Calculate the Joint Probability**\n\nThe final step is to find the total probability of measuring P=0 *and then* Q=-1. This is the product of the two probabilities calculated.\n`Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | after P=0)`\n`Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\n<<<D>>>"
