    "To determine the total energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus, we can use the formula for relativistic energy.\n\n### 1. Identify the Nucleus and its Properties\n\n*   The user specifies \"Li with 3 neutrons\". Lithium (Li) has an atomic number of 3 (3 protons).\n*   The total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n*   The atomic mass of ⁶Li is approximately 6.015122887 atomic mass units (u).\n\n### 2. Relativistic Energy Calculation\n\nThe total relativistic energy (E) is given by the equation:\nE = γ * m₀ * c²\n\nWhere:\n*   **m₀** is the rest mass of the particle.\n*   **c** is the speed of light.\n*   **γ** (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**a) Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe speed (v) is given as 0.96c.\n*   v²/c² = (0.96c)² / c² = 0.96² = 0.9216\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √(0.0784)\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857\n\n**b) Determine the Rest Energy (m₀c²):**\nFirst, we find the rest mass (m₀) of the ⁶Li nucleus. The given atomic mass includes electrons, which we must subtract for the nuclear mass.\n*   Atomic mass of ⁶Li: 6.01512289 u.\n*   Mass of 3 electrons: 3 * 0.00054858 u ≈ 0.00164574 u.\n*   Nuclear mass of ⁶Li: 6.01512289 u - 0.00164574 u ≈ 6.01347715 u. This calculated value is consistent with the literature.\n\nNext, convert the nuclear mass from atomic mass units (u) to Giga-electron-volts (GeV/c²).\n*   Conversion factor: 1 u ≈ 0.9314941 GeV/c².\n*   Rest energy (m₀c²): 6.01347715 u * 0.9314941 GeV/c² / u ≈ 5.60195 GeV.\n\n**c) Calculate the Total Energy (E):**\nNow, multiply the Lorentz factor by the rest energy.\n*   E = γ * (m₀c²)\n*   E ≈ 3.57142857 * 5.60195 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.0069 GeV\n\nThis result is closest to option C. To ensure precision, let's recalculate using the direct binding energy value, which can be more precise. The nuclear binding energy of ⁶Li is 31.994 MeV, or 0.031994 GeV. Another source places the binding energy per nucleon at 5.332 MeV, for a total of 6 * 5.332 = 31.992 MeV (0.031992 GeV). Using the total mass is generally more direct.\n\nRe-evaluating with the most precise figures available from the search:\n*   Rest Mass (m₀) of ⁶Li nucleus: 6.0134771 u\n*   Rest Energy (m₀c²): 6.0134771 u * 931.49410242 MeV/u = 5601.95 MeV = 5.60195 GeV\n*   Lorentz Factor (γ) for v=0.96c: 1 / √(1-0.96²) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857...\n*   Total Energy (E) = 3.57142857 * 5.60195 GeV = 20.00696 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.007 GeV is closest to option C. The minor difference might stem from rounding in the provided options or slight variations in mass constants. However, based on the calculation, 20.132 GeV is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
