    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a type of chemical reaction known as a-sigmatropic rearrangement, specifically a Cope rearrangement. This reaction is common for 1,5-dienes, which is the structural pattern found in the starting molecule.\n\nThe Cope rearrangement involves a reorganization of the electrons through a cyclic, six-membered transition state. In the case of 5-butylnona-2,6-diene, the carbon chain from carbon-2 to carbon-7 forms the reacting 1,5-diene system. The reaction involves the breaking of the single bond between carbon-4 and carbon-5 and the formation of a new single bond between carbon-2 and carbon-7. Simultaneously, the double bonds shift from the C2=C3 and C6=C7 positions to the C3=C4 and C5=C6 positions.\n\nTo determine the structure of the resulting product, we can trace the connectivity of the atoms after the rearrangement and then apply IUPAC nomenclature rules:\n1.  **Identify the new main chain**: The longest continuous carbon chain in the product includes the original butyl group and carbons 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, and 4. This new main chain is 10 carbons long, making the product a decadiene.\n2.  **Locate the double bonds**: The new double bonds are located between C3 and C4, and between C5 and C6. Numbering the new 10-carbon chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants results in a deca-1,5-diene.\n3.  **Identify the substituents**: The methyl group (originally C1) is now at position 3 of the new main chain. The ethyl group (originally C8 and C9) is at position 4.\n\nFollowing these steps, the product is named **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**. This corresponds to option B. The reaction is driven by the formation of a thermodynamically stable product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
