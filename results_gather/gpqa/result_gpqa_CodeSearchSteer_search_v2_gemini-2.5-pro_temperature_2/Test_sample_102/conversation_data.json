    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\nThis molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship with each other (1,3,5-substitution).\n\n**Analysis of the reaction steps and directing effects:**\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3):** This reaction introduces an acetyl group (-COCH3). The acetyl group is a *meta*-director and is deactivating. A critical limitation of this reaction is that it fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene) and on rings containing an amino group (-NH2), as the amine reacts with the AlCl3 catalyst.\n*   **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** This introduces a nitro group (-NO2), which is a strong deactivator and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromination (Br2/FeBr3):** This introduces a bromo group (-Br), which is a weak deactivator but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Reduction of Nitro Group (Fe/HCl):** This converts a nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2).\n*   **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) followed by Deamination (H3PO2):** This sequence converts an amino group (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+), which is then replaced by a hydrogen atom (-H), effectively removing the amino group. This is often used to remove a directing group after it has served its purpose.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\n*   **Option B):**\n    i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n    ii) Reduction gives aniline.\n    iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form a salt. This deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Thus, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C):**\n    i) Bromination of benzene gives bromobenzene.\n    ii) Nitration gives a mixture of ortho- and para-nitrobromobenzene, not the meta-isomer needed.\n    iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted on bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by both the nitro and bromo groups, so the acylation would not proceed. Thus, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D):**\n    i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n    ii) -> Aniline\n    iii) -> Benzenediazonium salt\n    iv) -> Benzene. Steps i-iv convert benzene back into benzene, which makes no sense. Thus, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A):**\n    i) **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** The Friedel-Crafts acylation is performed on an activated ring and proceeds correctly. The product is acetophenone.\n    ii) **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The acetyl group is a meta-director, so bromination occurs at the meta-position (C3). This step is correct.\n    iii) **1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** Now, nitration is performed on a ring with an acetyl group (meta-director) at C1 and a bromo group (ortho, para-director) at C3.\n        *   The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position C5.\n        *   The bromo group directs to positions C2, C4, and C6.\n        *   However, the positions ortho to the bulky acetyl group (C2 and C6) are sterically hindered and deactivated. Position C4 is also deactivated. Therefore, the reaction favors substitution at the less hindered C5 position, which is meta to both existing groups. This leads to the desired 1,3,5-substituted product.\n    iv-vii) The remaining steps (reduction of the nitro group, another nitration, and then deamination) are superfluous and nonsensical as the desired product has already been formed in step iii. These extra steps appear to be an error in the question's options, but the initial sequence (i-iii) represents the only chemically viable route among the choices.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSequence A provides the only plausible route to the target molecule, as the other options involve reactions that are known to fail under the specified conditions.\n\n<<<A>>>"
