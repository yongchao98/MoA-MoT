    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹**: This is a classic characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between molecules. Alcohols also show a broad O-H peak, but typically centered higher, around 3200-3550 cm⁻¹. The peak for a carboxylic acid O-H stretch is notably broad, often spanning from 2500 to 3300 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹**: This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This could indicate a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Combined with the very broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹**: This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which typically occurs in the 1600-1680 cm⁻¹ range. This finding is consistent with the 1H NMR data.\n\n### 2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens**: The presence of vinyl hydrogens (protons attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond) confirms the existence of an alkene functional group in the molecule.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45**: This is a very common fragment in mass spectrometry. It can correspond to the ethoxy fragment ([OCH₂CH₃]⁺), but it is also highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid, which fragments to form the [COOH]⁺ ion. Given the strong evidence for a carboxylic acid from the FTIR data, the [COOH]⁺ fragment is the most logical identification.\n\n### 4. Calculation of Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe degrees of unsaturation indicate the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\nThe spectral data indicate the presence of at least two functional groups that contribute to unsaturation: a carbonyl group (C=O) and an alkene group (C=C). This means the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the given options:\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the degrees of unsaturation, options A and D can be eliminated as they only have one degree of unsaturation, which cannot account for both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n\nComparing the remaining options, B and C, the evidence points to C. The combination of a very broad O-H stretch (3000 cm⁻¹) and a C=O stretch (1700 cm⁻¹) is the hallmark of a carboxylic acid, which contains two oxygen atoms. Furthermore, the mass spectrum fragment at m/z = 45 is a diagnostic peak for the carboxylic acid group ([COOH]⁺). Therefore, the molecular formula must be C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"
