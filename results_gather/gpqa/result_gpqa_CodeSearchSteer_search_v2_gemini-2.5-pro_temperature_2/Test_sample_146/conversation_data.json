    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Conservation of Energy\n\nThe annihilation process is governed by the law of conservation of energy. The total energy of the system before the annihilation must equal the total energy of the system after the annihilation.\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):** The system initially consists of a proton (p) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume both particles are effectively at rest. Therefore, the initial energy is the sum of their rest energies. The rest energy of a particle is given by Einstein's equation, E = mc².\n\n    *   The rest energy of a proton (m_p * c²) is approximately 938 MeV.\n    *   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so its rest energy is also 938 MeV.\n    *   E_initial = (m_p * c²) + (m_{\\bar{p}} * c²) = 938 MeV + 938 MeV = 1876 MeV.\n\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):** The system finally consists of four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. All these particles have the same given mass, m_A.\n\n    *   The rest energy of each particle A is given as m_A * c² = 300 MeV.\n    *   Since these particles are moving, their total energy is the sum of their rest energy and kinetic energy, which is given by the relativistic energy formula: E_A = γ * m_A * c², where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   E_final = 4 * (γ * m_A * c²) = 4 * γ * (300 MeV) = 1200 * γ MeV.\n\n### 2. Solving for the Lorentz Factor (γ)\n\nBy the conservation of energy:\n\nE_initial = E_final\n1876 MeV = 1200 * γ MeV\n\nNow, we can solve for γ:\n\nγ = 1876 / 1200\nγ ≈ 1.5633\n\n### 3. Calculating the Velocity (v)\n\nThe Lorentz factor is related to velocity by the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nTo find the velocity (v), we rearrange the formula:\n\nγ² = 1 / (1 - v²/c²)\n1 - v²/c² = 1 / γ²\nv²/c² = 1 - 1 / γ²\nv = c * √(1 - 1 / γ²)\n\nNow, we substitute the value of γ we calculated:\n\nv = c * √(1 - 1 / (1.5633)²)\nv = c * √(1 - 1 / 2.444)\nv = c * √(1 - 0.409)\nv = c * √(0.591)\nv ≈ 0.7688c\n\nThis velocity is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<D>>>"
