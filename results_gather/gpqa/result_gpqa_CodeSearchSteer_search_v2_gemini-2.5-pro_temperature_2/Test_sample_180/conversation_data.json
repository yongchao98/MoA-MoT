    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the flux ratio.\n\n### 1. Identify Neutrino Sources in the Energy Bands\n\nFirst, we must identify which solar fusion reactions produce neutrinos in the two specified energy bands under normal conditions.\n\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV or 0.7-0.8 MeV):**\n    *   **⁸B (Boron-8) neutrinos:** The decay of ⁸B, which is the final step of the pp-III branch, produces neutrinos with a continuous energy spectrum up to about 15 MeV. This spectrum contributes flux to the 700-800 keV band.\n    *   **CNO cycle neutrinos:** The CNO cycle also produces neutrinos with continuous spectra (from ¹³N and ¹⁵O decays) that fall within this range. However, the CNO cycle is responsible for only about 1% of the Sun's energy output, and its neutrino flux is correspondingly low compared to the main pp-chain reactions.\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV or 0.8-0.9 MeV):**\n    *   **⁷Be (Beryllium-7) neutrinos:** The pp-II branch involves the electron capture of ⁷Be, which produces mono-energetic (single-energy) neutrinos. The primary line is at 862 keV (0.862 MeV), with a smaller line at a much lower energy. This very strong 862 keV line falls directly in the center of Band 2.\n    *   **⁸B (Boron-8) neutrinos:** The continuous spectrum from ⁸B decay also contributes flux to this band.\n    *   **CNO cycle neutrinos:** A small flux from the CNO cycle is also present in this band.\n\n### 2. Apply the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**.\n\n*   The pp-III branch is the sequence of reactions: ⁷Be + p → ⁸B + γ, followed by the decay of ⁸B.\n*   Stopping this branch means that **⁸B neutrinos are no longer produced**.\n*   Crucially, the problem states that all other reactions, including the pp-II branch, continue as normal. The pp-II branch is the source of the ⁷Be neutrinos.\n\n### 3. Re-evaluate the Flux in Each Band\n\nWith the pp-III branch turned off, the neutrino sources in each band are now:\n\n*   **Flux (Band 1: 700-800 keV):** The flux from ⁸B disappears. The only remaining contribution is the very low flux from the continuous spectrum of CNO neutrinos.\n*   **Flux (Band 2: 800-900 keV):** The flux from ⁸B disappears. However, the **very strong, mono-energetic line from ⁷Be neutrinos at 862 keV remains**. There is also the negligible contribution from CNO neutrinos.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Flux Ratio\n\nWe now need to calculate the ratio: Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2).\n\n*   **Numerator (Flux in Band 1):** This is the very small flux from a 100 keV-wide slice of the CNO neutrino spectrum.\n*   **Denominator (Flux in Band 2):** This is dominated by the massive flux from the ⁷Be line at 862 keV.\n\nLooking at a standard solar neutrino spectrum, the flux from the ⁷Be line is a massive, sharp peak, whereas the CNO flux is a low, broad continuum. The total flux of the CNO neutrinos is already significantly lower than the total flux of ⁷Be neutrinos. When we consider only a small energy slice (700-800 keV) of the CNO continuum and compare it to the almost entirely-concentrated flux of the ⁷Be peak (which is one of the dominant features of the entire solar neutrino spectrum above the `pp` neutrinos), the ratio of the two will be extremely small.\n\nThe flux in Band 1 becomes almost zero, while the flux in Band 2 remains very high due to the unaffected ⁷Be neutrinos. The ratio of an extremely small number to a very large number is an extremely small number.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 0.01 (10⁻²)\n*   B) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n*   C) 10\n*   D) 1\n\nOptions C and D are incorrect as the ratio must be much less than 1. The flux contribution from the CNO cycle is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than the main pp-chain fluxes. Therefore, a ratio on the order of 0.01 is far more plausible than 0.1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
