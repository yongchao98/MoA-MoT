    "A dominant-negative mutation is one where the mutant protein not only loses its own function but also interferes with the function of the wild-type protein present in the same cell. The key is that for many transcription factors, dimerization is essential for their activity.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the scenario with mutation Y:\n*   **The Problem:** Mutation Y is in the dimerization domain.\n*   **Heterozygous State:** The cell produces both normal (wild-type) and mutant (Y) subunits of the transcription factor.\n*   **Interaction:** The mutant Y protein is still able to dimerize, or \"pair up,\" with the wild-type protein. However, because its dimerization domain is faulty, the resulting wild-type/mutant heterodimer is non-functional.\n*   **The \"Poison\" Effect:** By binding to wild-type proteins and forming these useless pairs, the mutant Y protein effectively sequesters the functional wild-type proteins, preventing them from forming functional wild-type/wild-type dimers. This leads to an overall loss of the transcription factor's function, which is a more severe outcome than if the mutant protein simply failed to function on its own.\n*   **Cellular Response:** Misfolded or improperly formed protein complexes, such as the non-functional heterodimer, are often recognized by the cell's quality control systems and targeted for degradation. This would further reduce the amount of available wild-type protein, reinforcing the loss-of-function phenotype.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this mechanism:\n\n*   **A) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While aggregation is possible for some mutations, it is not the primary or defining mechanism for this type of dominant-negative effect. The core issue is the interference with the wild-type protein, leading to a loss of function.\n*   **B) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. The mutation is described as dominant-*negative*, which means it inhibits or antagonizes the normal function, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype, not a gain of a new one.\n*   **C) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This is the most accurate description. The formation of faulty wild-type/mutant dimers that are targeted for degradation is a classic mechanism for a dominant-negative mutation. This process effectively neutralizes the wild-type protein, causing a loss-of-function of the wild-type allele.\n*   **D) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. If the mutation completely prevented the protein from dimerizing, it couldn't interfere with the wild-type protein. The remaining wild-type proteins would be free to form functional dimers, likely resulting in a normal or near-normal (wild-type) phenotype, which would be characteristic of a recessive mutation, not a dominant-negative one.\n\nTherefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is the degradation of the protein complex and the resulting loss-of-function of the wild-type allele.\n\n<<<C>>>"
