  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "An analysis of the provided DNA sequence reveals the reason for the lack of protein overexpression. The key is to translate the DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence, starting from the initial `ATG` start codon.\n\nThe sequence begins with the codons for the N-terminal tag and the start of the GADD45G protein:\n\n*   **Antigenic Determinant (HA-tag):** The standard amino acid sequence for an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag is YPYDVPDYA. Your construct correctly encodes this sequence, preceded by a Methionine (from the `ATG` start codon):\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine\n    *   `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC` -> Tyrosine-Proline-Tyrosine-Aspartate-Valine-Proline-Aspartate-Tyrosine-Alanine (YPYDVPDYA)\n\n*   **Premature Termination:** Immediately following the sequence for the HA-tag, the next codons are:\n    *   `AAA` -> Lysine\n    *   `TGA` -> **Stop Codon**\n\nThe genetic code includes three stop codons (`UAA`, `UAG`, and `UGA` in mRNA, which correspond to `TAA`, `TAG`, and `TGA` in the coding DNA strand) that signal the ribosome to halt protein synthesis. The presence of the `TGA` codon in the same reading frame as the gene sequence causes the ribosome to detach from the mRNA long before it can translate the GADD45G portion of the construct. As a result, only a very short, non-functional peptide (MYPYDVPDYAK) is produced instead of the full-length fusion protein.\n\nTherefore, the other options are incorrect:\n*   **A) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** Stop codons are read by release factors, not tRNAs. Their function is to terminate, not continue, translation. This statement is biologically inaccurate.\n*   **B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** The HA-tag sequence is correctly encoded.\n*   **D) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can sometimes improve protein stability and folding, their absence is not the definitive error here. The guaranteed cause of failure is the premature stop codon.\n\nThe correct explanation is that a premature stop codon was accidentally introduced into the sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>"
