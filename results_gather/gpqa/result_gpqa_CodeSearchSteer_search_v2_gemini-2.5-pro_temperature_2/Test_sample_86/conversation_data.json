    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound's Molecular Formula and Key Features:**\n    *   **6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene core, which accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Di-substituted:** There are two groups attached to the benzene ring. This means there are four protons directly attached to the ring.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbons.\n    *   **Carbonyl group:** A C=O group is present in one of the substituents.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen atom (like Cl, Br, F) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain two carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Combining these, the compound is a haloacetophenone. A representative structure would be 4-chloroacetophenone (p-chloroacetophenone). This molecule has 8 carbons (6 from the ring, 2 from the acetyl group), a carbonyl group, a di-substituted ring, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n3.  **Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** For a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) ring like 4-chloroacetophenone, the four aromatic protons are not equivalent. There will be two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The protons ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be deshielded and appear downfield (higher ppm). The protons ortho to the halogen will be in a slightly different environment. This arrangement typically gives rise to two distinct signals, each integrating to two protons (2H). Due to coupling with their neighbors, these signals appear as doublets (d). Therefore, we expect to see a pattern like: (2H, d) and (2H, d) in the aromatic region (~7.0–8.0 ppm). For example, the spectrum for 4-chloroacetophenone shows two doublets at approximately 7.91 ppm and 7.45 ppm.\n    *   **Substituent Protons:** The acetyl group (-COCH₃) has three equivalent protons on the methyl group. Since this methyl group has no adjacent protons, its signal will be a singlet (s). The chemical shift for protons on a carbon next to a carbonyl group is typically around 2.0-2.5 ppm. For various haloacetophenones, this signal appears between 2.58 and 2.61 ppm.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical shift (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**: The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not an acetyl group. This option is inconsistent with the likely structure.\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical shift (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: This spectrum lacks signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm), which is essential for an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical shift (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**: This spectrum perfectly matches the prediction for a para-haloacetophenone. It shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for two protons, and a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm for the acetyl methyl group.\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical shift (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**: The aromatic region only shows one proton, and the other signals do not align with the expected structure. This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the data presented in option C is the only one that correctly represents the described compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
