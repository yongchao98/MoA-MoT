    "To answer this question, we must identify the compound that does not exhibit tautomerism (A) and the one that shows optical isomerism (B).\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. Keto-enol tautomerism is the most common type, involving the migration of a proton and a shift in the location of a double bond. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has alpha-hydrogens on the carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6. These hydrogens can move, allowing the compound to convert to its enol tautomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is particularly stable because it is aromatic. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.\n*   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** This molecule does not have any alpha-hydrogen atoms on sp³-hybridized carbons. The hydrogens are attached to the sp²-hybridized carbons of the double bonds. While it has alpha-hydrogens, they are vinylic and not easily removed to form an enol. The absence of a suitable alpha-hydrogen prevents it from undergoing typical keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for (A):** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common source of chirality is a stereocenter, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), a hydroxyl group (-OH), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since C2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the chemical structure (CH₃OOC)CH=CH(COOCH₃) where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration. The molecule is planar around the carbon-carbon double bond and does not contain any chiral centers. It has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral, meaning it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for (B):** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.\n\nCombining these findings:\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
