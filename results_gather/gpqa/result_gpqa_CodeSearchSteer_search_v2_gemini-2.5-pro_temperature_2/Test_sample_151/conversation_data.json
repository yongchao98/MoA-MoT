    "When the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is treated with a mating pheromone, it undergoes a specific set of cellular changes. It arrests its cell cycle in the G1 phase and forms a projection called a shmoo, preparing for mating. This process involves a significant change in gene expression, where mating-specific genes are highly transcribed while cell-cycle progression into the DNA replication (S) phase is halted.\n\nThe experiment aims to identify the proteome of the *active chromatin*. Active chromatin is associated with active gene transcription. Let's evaluate the given options in this context:\n\n*   **B) Nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes are the fundamental building blocks of all chromatin, both active and inactive. They are composed of histone proteins and would be abundantly recovered in any chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.\n*   **C) Enhancer protein complex:** During the mating response, transcription factors like Ste12 are activated and bind to enhancer regions of DNA to strongly promote the transcription of mating-specific genes. These complexes are a key feature of active chromatin in this state.\n*   **D) Pre-initiation complex (PIC):** This large complex, which includes RNA Polymerase II, assembles at the promoters of genes to begin transcription. Given that many genes are activated to form the shmoo, PICs would be numerous on the active chromatin.\n\n*   **A) Pre-replication complex (PRC):** This complex assembles on DNA at origins of replication during the G1 phase to prepare for DNA synthesis. However, the mating pheromone induces an arrest in G1, preventing the cell from entering the S phase and initiating DNA replication. Therefore, although the PRC is assembled and present on the chromatin, its function is inhibited, and it is not associated with the *active* process of transcription that characterizes the shmoo response.\n\nConclusion: While nucleosomes, enhancer proteins, and pre-initiation complexes are all integral parts of actively transcribing chromatin, the pre-replication complex is associated with DNA replication, a process that is actively inhibited during shmoo formation. Therefore, it is the complex that would be least expected in an assay specifically targeting the proteome of *active chromatin*.\n\n<<<A>>>"
