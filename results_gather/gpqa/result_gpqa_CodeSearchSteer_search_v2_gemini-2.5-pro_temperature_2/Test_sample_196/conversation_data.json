    "### Identification of Compound X and the Final Product\n\nBased on the spectral data, we can deduce the structure of the initial compound, Compound X, and then determine the final product after its reaction with red phosphorus and hydriodic acid (HI).\n\n**1. Analysis of Compound X from Spectral Data:**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum:** The broad absorption in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid. The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, further supporting the presence of a carboxylic acid. The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are indicative of an aromatic ring.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   A broad singlet at 10.5 ppm is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   Two doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, each representing two protons, suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is likely for protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The signals in the alkyl region (2.9 ppm to 0.9 ppm) describe a sec-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃] attached to the benzene ring.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** The methine (CH) proton attached to the ring.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** The methylene (CH₂) protons of the ethyl part.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** The methyl (CH₃) protons split by the single methine proton.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** The terminal methyl (CH₃) protons split by the adjacent methylene protons.\n\nCombining these observations, **Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.**\n\n**2. Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:**\n\nThe reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and hydriodic acid (HI) is a powerful reduction. This reagent combination completely reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction can be generalized as: R-COOH + 6HI → R-CH₃ + 2H₂O + 3I₂.\n\nIn this specific case, the 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced. The carboxylic acid function will be converted into a methyl group, while the sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring will remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.**\n\nMatching this conclusion with the given choices:\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is incorrect.\n*   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - The structure is incorrect.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
