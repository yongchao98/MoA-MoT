    "To determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we need to analyze the directing effects of the substituents at each step and the overall compatibility of the reactions.\n\n**Target Molecule Analysis:**\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. The substitution pattern is:\n*   Ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   Nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nLet's examine the directing effects of these groups:\n*   **-OEt (alkoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (alkyl):** Weakly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nA crucial feature of the target is the meta relationship between the strong ortho, para-directing ethoxy group and the meta-directing nitro group. This suggests that these groups were not placed on the ring while the other was present in its final form. It often points towards a strategy involving functional group transformation, such as creating a phenol from an amine and then converting it to an ether.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene. (OK)\nii) `SO3/H2SO4`: tert-Butylbenzene -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The para position is sterically favored and blocked. (OK)\niii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Both -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) direct to the position ortho to the t-butyl group. Product is 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (OK)\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. Product is 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. (OK)\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amine. Product is 4-tert-butyl-2-sulfobenzenediazonium salt. (OK)\nvi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This step is not a standard reaction for diazonium salts. While there are Sandmeyer-type reactions to introduce a nitro group (using NaNO2/Cu), using a nitrating mixture on a diazonium salt is not a conventional or high-yield process for substitution. This makes the sequence questionable.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene. (OK)\nii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline. (OK)\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. **This step fails.** The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring so strongly that Friedel-Crafts reactions do not occur. Thus, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option C:**\nThe order of reactions appears incorrect for a high-yield synthesis. For instance, putting the nitro group on last (step ix) would mean nitrating 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene. The -OEt and -tBu groups are both strong ortho, para-directors and would direct nitration to positions 4 and 6, not position 3. This sequence will not yield the desired product.\n\n**Option D:**\nLet's analyze this sequence step-by-step:\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-Butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The t-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, the para-substituted product, **4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**, is formed as the major product, ensuring a high yield for this step.\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group gives the corresponding amine, **4-tert-butylaniline**.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acidic medium, the amine is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). Let's look at the directing effects on this intermediate:\n    *   The anilinium group (-NH3+) is at C1 and is a meta-director, directing incoming electrophiles to positions C3 and C5.\n    *   The tert-butyl group (-tBu) is at C4 and is an ortho, para-director. It directs incoming electrophiles to its ortho positions, which are also C3 and C5.\n    *   Since both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C3 and C5), their effects are **synergistic**, leading to a high yield of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline** (or if numbered differently to give aniline priority, 3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline). Let's correct the initial analysis. tBu is at C4, it directs ortho to C3/C5. NH3+ is at C1, it directs meta to C3/C5. So, the nitration gives **4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline produces the corresponding diazonium salt, **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\nvi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Heating the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), yielding **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenoxide, formed by deprotonating the phenol with NaOH, reacts with ethyl bromide to form an ether. This converts the -OH group to an -OEt group, yielding **4-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThe final product of sequence D is **4-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. The question asks for the synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. These are structural isomers. However, the synthetic pathway outlined in option D is chemically sound, uses high-yield reactions, and takes advantage of synergistic directing effects. The other options contain chemically infeasible or highly problematic steps. It is very likely that there is a typo in the name of the target compound in the question prompt and that the sequence in option D is the intended correct answer.\n\nGiven the choices, Option D describes the most plausible and logical high-yield synthetic route, despite the discrepancy in the name of the final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
