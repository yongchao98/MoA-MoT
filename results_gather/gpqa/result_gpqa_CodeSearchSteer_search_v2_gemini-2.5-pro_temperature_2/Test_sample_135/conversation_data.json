    "To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the given vector field, we can use two primary methods: direct computation of the divergence followed by volume integration, or the Divergence Theorem.\n\nThe vector field is given by **f(r)** = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n### Method 1: Direct Calculation (with a subtlety)\n\nFirst, we calculate the divergence of **f** in spherical coordinates. For a vector field with only a radial component, F(r) = F_r * **r̂**, the divergence is:\n∇ · **f** = (1/r²) * ∂/∂r (r² * f_r)\n\nIn this case, the radial component f_r is 1/r². Substituting this into the formula:\n∇ · **f** = (1/r²) * ∂/∂r (r² * (1/r²))\n∇ · **f** = (1/r²) * ∂/∂r (1)\n\nThe derivative of the constant '1' with respect to r is 0.\n∇ · **f** = (1/r²) * 0 = 0\n\nThis result holds for any r ≠ 0. However, at the origin (r = 0), the vector field itself is singular (division by zero), and therefore its divergence is also not defined in the usual sense. This singularity at the origin means we cannot simply conclude the integral of the divergence is zero. The divergence at the origin behaves like a Dirac delta function. A more robust method is required.\n\n### Method 2: The Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)\n\nThe Divergence Theorem provides a more reliable way to solve this problem, as it relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface enclosing the volume. The theorem states:\n\n∫∫∫_V (∇ · **f**) dV = ∬_S (**f** ⋅ **n̂**) dS\n\nHere:\n*   V is the volume of the sphere of radius R.\n*   S is the surface of the sphere of radius R.\n*   **n̂** is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface S.\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral (the flux):\n1.  **On the surface of the sphere (r=R):** The vector field is **f(R)** = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n2.  **The outward normal vector:** For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward unit normal vector **n̂** is simply the radial unit vector **r̂**.\n3.  **The dot product:** **f** ⋅ **n̂** = [(1/R²) **r̂**] ⋅ [**r̂**] = 1/R² (since **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1).\n4.  **The surface element:** In spherical coordinates, the differential surface element dS is R² sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n5.  **The integral:** We integrate the dot product over the entire surface of the sphere:\n    Flux = ∬_S (1/R²) dS = ∫[from φ=0 to 2π] ∫[from θ=0 to π] (1/R²) * (R² sin(θ) dθ dφ)\n\nThe R² terms cancel out:\nFlux = ∫[from φ=0 to 2π] dφ * ∫[from θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ\n\nEvaluating the integrals:\n*   ∫[from 0 to 2π] dφ = [φ] from 0 to 2π = 2π\n*   ∫[from 0 to π] sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nMultiplying the results gives the total flux:\nFlux = (2π) * (2) = 4π.\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this flux. Therefore, the value of the integral is 4π.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4 π\nC) 1\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe correct answer is 4π.\n\n<<<B>>>"
