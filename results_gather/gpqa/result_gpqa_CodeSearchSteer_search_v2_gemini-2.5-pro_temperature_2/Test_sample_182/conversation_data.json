    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and Reagents\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure:\n    *   **cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n    *   **carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group.\n    *   **formyl group:** A -CHO group (an aldehyde).\n    *   **vinyl group:** A -CH=CH₂ group.\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Chemical Reaction\n\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known to reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds completely to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n\nThe specific transformations are:\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group is also reduced, converting the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) into an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure and Molecular Formula\n\nThe reaction reduces all sites of unsaturation and removes all oxygen atoms, without changing the carbon skeleton.\n\n*   **Carbon Count:** The starting molecule has a 6-carbon ring, a 1-carbon carboxylic acid, a 1-carbon formyl group, and a 2-carbon vinyl group. This gives a total of 10 carbon atoms. The product will also have 10 carbon atoms.\n*   **Product Structure:** The original cyclohexene ring becomes a saturated cyclohexane ring. All the functional groups become simple alkyl substituents. The final product is 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane.\n*   **Product Class:** The product is a substituted cycloalkane. A cycloalkane with a single ring is a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Saturated acyclic alkanes have the general formula CnH2n+2. Saturated cycloalkanes (with one ring) have the general formula CnH2n. Since our product has 10 carbon atoms and one ring, its molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula.\n\nThe formula for a hydrocarbon (CxHy) is:\nIHD = C - (H / 2) + 1\n\nFor the product with the formula C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nThe IHD value of 1 corresponds to the single ring present in the final product molecule (a substituted cyclohexane).\n\n<<<C>>>"
