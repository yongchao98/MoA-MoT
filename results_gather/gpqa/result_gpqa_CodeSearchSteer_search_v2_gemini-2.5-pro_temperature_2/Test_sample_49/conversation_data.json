    "The defining characteristic in the expression that points to the number of loops is the factor of `1/(4π)^6`.\n\nIn quantum field theory calculations performed in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a Feynman diagram introduces a factor of `1/(4π)^2` to the final amplitude after regularization and integration. This factor arises from the integration over the unconstrained four-momentum circulating within the loop.\n\nLet L be the number of loops in the diagram. The total contribution from the loop integrals will be `(1/(4π)^2)^L`, which simplifies to `1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\nThe note found on the desk contains the term `1/(4pi)^6`. By comparing this with the general formula, we can set up the equation:\n\n`1/(4π)^(2L) = 1/(4π)^6`\n\nThis implies that `2L = 6`, and therefore, `L = 3`.\n\nThe other terms in the expression are consistent with a three-loop calculation:\n*   **`alpha^3 * g^2`**: These are the coupling constants. Their combined power suggests the diagram has a total of five vertices, where particles interact.\n*   **`sqrt(2) * 8`**: These are numerical factors that often arise from symmetry considerations of the diagram and from the specifics of the particle interactions (e.g., traces over gamma matrices for fermions).\n*   **`(Q/M)^2`**: This represents the ratio of two relevant energy scales squared (for instance, the momentum transfer `Q` and a particle mass `M`). Such terms are typical in the final results of loop calculations.\n\nThus, the crucial piece of information is the power of the `1/(4π)` factor, which directly indicates that the Feynman diagram had three loops.\n\n<<<D>>>"
