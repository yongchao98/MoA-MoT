    "Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a phenomenon where a system that is symmetric with respect to some symmetry group transitions into a state that is not symmetric. Goldstone's theorem states that for every continuous symmetry that is spontaneously broken, a new massless scalar particle must appear in the spectrum of possible excitations. These particles are known as Goldstone bosons.\n\n*   **Pion (A):** The pion is a pseudo-Goldstone boson. It arises from the spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by the strong interaction. If the quarks were massless, the pion would be a true massless Goldstone boson. Because quarks have a small mass, the symmetry is not exact, which gives the pion its relatively small mass.\n*   **Magnon (C):** In magnetic materials like ferromagnets, the inherent rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken when the magnetic moments align in a specific direction below a critical temperature. The resulting collective excitations of the spin system are spin waves, and their quanta are called magnons, which are the Goldstone bosons of this broken symmetry.\n*   **Phonon (D):** In a crystalline solid, the continuous translational and rotational symmetry of free space is spontaneously broken by the formation of the fixed lattice structure. Phonons, which are the quanta of vibrations in this lattice, are the Goldstone bosons associated with the breaking of translational symmetry.\n*   **Skyrmion (B):** A skyrmion is a topologically stable, particle-like excitation in a continuous field. Skyrmions are not the Goldstone bosons that result directly from spontaneous symmetry breaking. Instead, they are topological solitons that can emerge in systems where symmetries are broken, such as in chiral magnets or in the effective field theory of pions. While their formation can be associated with a phase transition that breaks a symmetry, the skyrmion itself is a massive, non-perturbative object, distinct from the massless Goldstone bosons predicted by Goldstone's theorem.\n\nTherefore, the pion, magnon, and phonon are all considered (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, whereas the skyrmion is a different kind of entity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
