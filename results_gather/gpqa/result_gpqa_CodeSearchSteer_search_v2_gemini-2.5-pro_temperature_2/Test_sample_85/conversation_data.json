    "Based on the principles of organic chemistry and the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents involved, the correct starting materials can be determined.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Compound A is treated with Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and then an acid (H⁺).\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one (an R-lactone).\n*   **Chemoselectivity of LiBH₄:** Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. The other end of the molecule, the carboxylic acid, remains unchanged. In the presence of acid (H⁺), the resulting hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the six-membered ring lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The chemical transformations (reduction of the ester and lactonization) do not affect the existing chiral center at carbon-3 of the starting material. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\n    Therefore, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Compound B is treated with borane (BH₃) and then an acid (H⁺).\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one (an S-lactone).\n*   **Chemoselectivity of BH₃:** Borane is a reducing agent known for its ability to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact. The subsequent acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification reaction, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center at carbon-3 is not involved in the reaction and its configuration is preserved. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\n    Therefore, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the selective nature of the two different reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry, the correct pair of starting materials is:\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
