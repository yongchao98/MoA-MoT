    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 M × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **Total volume after adding water:**\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n*   **New concentration of acetic acid:**\n    *   Concentration = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n**2. Calculate the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.**\n\n*   The titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n*   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH equal the initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n*   Moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol\n*   **Volume of NaOH:**\n    *   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume of NaOH has been added.\n*   **Volume of NaOH added:**\n    *   0.25 × 10.00 cm³ = 2.50 cm³\n*   **Moles of NaOH added:**\n    *   0.1 M × 0.00250 L = 0.00025 mol\n*   This creates a buffer solution containing unreacted acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   **Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed:** 0.00025 mol\n    *   **Moles of CH₃COOH remaining:** 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol\n*   Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   **pKa:** = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    *   **pH:** = 4.73 + log(0.00025 / 0.00075) = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.48 = 4.25\n*   The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**4. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   **Total volume of the solution:**\n    *   40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]):**\n    *   0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   Acetate acts as a weak base, hydrolyzing water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0x10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41x10⁻¹⁰\n*   Calculate the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻] using the Kb expression:\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / 0.02 M\n    *   [OH⁻]² = (5.41x10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.082x10⁻¹¹\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(1.082x10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29x10⁻⁶ M\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    *   **pOH:** = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29x10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   **pH:** = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nTherefore, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26 and at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<D>>>"
