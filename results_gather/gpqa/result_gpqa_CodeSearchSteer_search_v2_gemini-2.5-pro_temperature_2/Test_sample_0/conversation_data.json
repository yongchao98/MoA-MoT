    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be significantly greater than the inherent energy uncertainties of each level. This energy uncertainty is a consequence of the finite lifetime of the quantum states, as described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n**1. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**\n\nThe relationship between the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) is given by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV⋅s. This principle implies that states with shorter lifetimes have a larger spread or uncertainty in their energy.\n\n**2. Calculating Energy Uncertainty for Each State**\n\nWe can calculate the minimum energy uncertainty for each quantum state:\n\n*   **For the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ ħ / Δt₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV⋅s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ ħ / Δt₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV⋅s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. Condition for Resolution**\n\nFor two energy levels to be clearly resolvable, their energy separation must be much larger than their individual energy uncertainties (or \"widths\"). Specifically, the energy difference should be significantly greater than the sum of these uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy uncertainty (~10⁻⁷ eV), which is the dominant factor for resolvability.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe must choose an energy difference that is substantially larger than approximately 10⁻⁷ eV:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than the energy uncertainty of the first state, so the levels would overlap significantly.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This energy difference is about 1,000 times larger than the energy uncertainty of the broader state. This large separation would allow the two levels to be very clearly distinguished.\n*   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This value is far too small and deep within the energy spread of both states.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is also much smaller than the energy uncertainty of the first state.\n\nTherefore, the only option that provides a sufficient energy difference for the two levels to be clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
