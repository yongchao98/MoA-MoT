    "This problem requires determining the product of a stereospecific chemical reaction. A detailed analysis based on the principles of organic chemistry is needed.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexene oxide, which is a type of epoxide. The bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane structure describes a cyclohexane ring fused to a three-membered ring. The \"7-oxa\" term indicates that the three-membered ring is an epoxide. The methyl groups and stereochemistry are precisely defined.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi, known as lithium dimethylcuprate or a Gilman reagent. This reagent provides a \"soft\" nucleophilic methyl group (CH₃⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem states that organocuprates react with saturated epoxides. This is a well-known ring-opening reaction of epoxides. The key characteristics of this reaction, as given in the prompt and supported by chemical principles, are:\n    *   The nucleophile (methyl group) attacks the epoxide ring.\n    *   The attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. This is a regioselective process.\n    *   The reaction proceeds via an S_N2 mechanism, which involves a \"backside\" attack and results in the inversion of configuration at the carbon that is attacked.\n\n**2. Identifying the Site of Attack:**\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by atoms C1, C6, and O7.\n*   C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a tertiary carbon center.\n*   C6 has no methyl group attached.\n*   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and the nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi will attack at C6.\n\n**3. Determining the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n*   **Initial state of C6:** The starting material has a stereochemical descriptor of (6S).\n*   **Reaction mechanism:** The reaction is an S_N2 reaction, which causes an inversion of stereochemical configuration at the center of attack. This means the tetrahedral arrangement of atoms around C6 is \"flipped\" like an umbrella in the wind.\n*   **Configuration at C6 after reaction:** Due to the inversion, the configuration at C6 will change. While a simple S to R flip is common, it's not guaranteed as it depends on the priority of the substituents. Let's analyze the change:\n    1.  The starting C6 is **S**.\n    2.  The S_N2 reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration.\n    3.  We need to determine the final Cahn-Ingold-Prelog descriptor for this carbon (which will be C2 in the final product). Let's assume the epoxide oxygen was \"up\". The nucleophilic methyl attacks from the \"down\" side. The hydrogen originally on C6 is pushed \"up\".\n    4.  The substituents on this carbon in the product are: C1 (now bearing an -OH), C5 (a ring carbon), a hydrogen, and the newly added methyl group.\n    5.  Assigning priorities: The C1 neighbor has the highest priority due to the attached oxygen. The C5 neighbor is next, followed by the new methyl group, and finally the hydrogen.\n    6.  When working through the 3D orientation, the resulting configuration at this center is found to be **S**. The priorities of the groups change in such a way that after the geometric inversion, the resulting designation is S.\n\n**4. Identifying the Final Product:**\n*   The reaction opens the epoxide to form a cyclohexanol.\n*   The original methyls at C1, C3, and C4 remain. A new methyl group is added at C6. The product is therefore a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n*   IUPAC naming rules require numbering the ring starting from the carbon with the hydroxyl group (the original C1), and proceeding in a direction that gives the substituent methyl groups the lowest possible numbers. This leads to a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** structure. Options A and D with a \"2,2,4,5\" substitution pattern are incorrect.\n*   The final choice depends on the stereochemistry. Based on the analysis above, the key stereocenter at C2 (the old C6) has the **S** configuration.\n*   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C4, C5) are carried over from the starting material, taking into account the renumbering of the ring. A full analysis confirms the stereochemistry as (1R, 4R, 5R).\n*   Combining these findings, the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
