    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary pion (π⁺) into a muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν).\n\nGiven:\n*   Decay process: π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n*   The pion (π⁺) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered massless (m_ν ≈ 0).\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe initial energy of the system is the rest energy of the stationary pion. The final energy is the sum of the total energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of the muon and the neutrino.\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):** `E_initial = m_π * c²`\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):** `E_final = E_μ + E_ν`\n\nThe total energy for the muon is `E_μ = m_μ * c² + KE_μ`, where `KE_μ` is its kinetic energy.\nSince the neutrino is massless, its rest energy is zero, and its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (`E_ν = KE_ν`).\n\nTherefore, the conservation of energy equation is:\n`m_π * c² = (m_μ * c² + KE_μ) + KE_ν`\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the initial pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction.\n\n*   **Initial Momentum (p_initial):** `0`\n*   **Final Momentum (p_final):** `p_μ + p_ν = 0`\n*   This implies `|p_μ| = |p_ν| = p`\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\n`E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`\n\n*   For the massless neutrino: `E_ν² = (p*c)²`, which means `E_ν = p*c`.\n    Therefore, the neutrino's kinetic energy is `KE_ν = p*c`.\n*   For the muon: `E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²`.\n    The total energy of the muon can also be written as `E_μ = m_μ*c² + KE_μ`.\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nWe can solve for the momentum (p) by substituting the expressions into the conservation of energy equation:\n`m_π*c² = E_μ + E_ν`\n`m_pi * c² = sqrt((p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²) + p*c`\n\nRearranging to solve for `p*c`:\n`(m_pi*c² - p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²`\n`(m_pi*c²)² - 2*(m_pi*c²)*(p*c) + (p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²`\n\nCancel `(p*c)²` from both sides:\n`(m_pi*c²)² - 2*(m_pi*c²)*(p*c) = (m_μ*c²)²`\n`p*c = ((m_pi*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)²) / (2 * m_pi * c²)`\n\nNow, we substitute the given mass values (using just the numbers in MeV, as the `c²` terms cancel out):\n*   `p*c = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6)`\n*   `p*c = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n*   `p*c = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n*   `p*c ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n**5. Determine Kinetic Energies**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    As derived earlier, `KE_ν = p*c`.\n    `KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n    We can find this from the total energy released (Q-value). The energy released is the difference in rest mass energy, which is converted into the kinetic energies of the products.\n    `Q = KE_μ + KE_ν = m_π*c² - m_μ*c²`\n    `Q = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV`\n\n    Now, substitute the value of `KE_ν`:\n    `KE_μ = Q - KE_ν`\n    `KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV`\n    `KE_μ = 4.1 MeV`\n\n    Alternatively, using the muon's relativistic energy equation confirms this result. The measured kinetic energy of the muon from this decay is indeed about 4.1 MeV.\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately **4.1 MeV** for the muon (μ⁺) and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino (ν).\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
