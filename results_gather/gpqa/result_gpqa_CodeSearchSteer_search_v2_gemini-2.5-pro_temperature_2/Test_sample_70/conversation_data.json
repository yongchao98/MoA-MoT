    "To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates away. For a planet in a circular orbit, its equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (a) from the star. This can be expressed as:\n    T_eq ∝ 1/√a\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance and Period:** Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit. Since the planets are in circular orbits, the semi-major axis is the orbital radius. The relationship is:\n    P² ∝ a³\n\n3.  **Determine the Ratios:** We are given the ratio of the orbital periods as P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (T_4 / T_2).\n\n    From the equilibrium temperature relation:\n    T_4 / T_2 = √(a_2 / a_4)\n\n    From Kepler's Third Law, we can find the ratio of the orbital distances (a_4 / a_2):\n    (a_4 / a_2)³ = (P_4 / P_2)²\n\n    From the given period ratios:\n    P_4 / P_2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\n    Now, substitute this into the Kepler's Law equation:\n    (a_4 / a_2)³ = (1.75)²\n    a_4 / a_2 = (1.75)^(2/3)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute the orbital distance ratio back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_4 / T_2 = 1 / √(a_4 / a_2)\n    T_4 / T_2 = 1 / √((1.75)^(2/3))\n    T_4 / T_2 = 1 / (1.75)^(1/3)\n\n    Calculating the value:\n    (1.75)^(1/3) ≈ 1.205\n    T_4 / T_2 ≈ 1 / 1.205 ≈ 0.8298\n\nThe problem assumes the planets have the same albedo, which is the fraction of light reflected by the planet. This, along with the fact they orbit the same star, allows for a direct comparison based on their orbital distances.\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.83. Comparing this to the options:\n\nA) ~0.69\nB) ~0.83\nC) ~0.75\nD) ~0.57\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
