    "All four of the listed issues can introduce errors into genomics data analysis, but some are more likely to produce difficult-to-spot erroneous results than others.\n\n- **Mutually incompatible data formats** often lead to more obvious errors. When tools cannot parse a file format, they typically fail to run, generating clear error messages. This makes the problem easier to identify and fix.\n\n- **The \"chr\" / \"no chr\" confusion** is a prevalent source of hard-to-detect errors. This issue arises from inconsistent chromosome naming conventions between different reference genomes and annotation files (e.g., \"chr1\" vs. \"1\"). While this can sometimes result in easy-to-spot empty output files, it can also silently lead to misalignments and inaccuracies in analyses.\n\n- **Reference assembly mismatch** is a common and subtle source of errors. The human genome, for example, has several reference assemblies (e.g., hg19/GRCh37 and hg38/GRCh38). Using different assemblies within the same analysis pipeline can cause misidentification of genetic variants, incorrect gene annotations, and inaccurate identification of genomic features. These errors can be difficult to trace, especially in large-scale analyses.\n\n- **Incorrect ID conversion** is another frequent source of hidden errors. Different databases may use various formats for gene and variant identifiers. Incorrectly converting these IDs can lead to gene misidentification, which propagates errors throughout the analysis pipeline. A classic example is spreadsheet software misinterpreting gene symbols as dates.\n\nConsidering the sources, the \"chr\" / \"no chr\" confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion are repeatedly highlighted as common and difficult-to-spot issues.\n\n<<<D>>>"
