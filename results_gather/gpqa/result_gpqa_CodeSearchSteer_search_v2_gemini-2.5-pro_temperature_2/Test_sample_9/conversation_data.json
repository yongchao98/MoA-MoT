    "Here's an analysis of each option to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This describes a planet essentially identical to Earth. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being about 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For rocky planets with the same composition, the density increases with mass due to gravitational compression. A planet five times more massive than Earth will have its material more tightly compressed by its own gravity, resulting in a significantly higher density than Earth's. For instance, a super-Earth with about five times the mass of our planet could have a density close to Earth's if it is rocky, but this can vary. However, the key factor is the gravitational self-compression.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** A less massive planet will experience less gravitational compression. Therefore, its density will be lower than that of Earth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy comparing the options, the planet described in (c) will have the highest density. The immense gravitational force of a planet five times the mass of Earth will compress its material far more than the other planets listed, leading to the greatest density.\n\n<<<A>>>"
