    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we can follow a systematic approach. The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O), which form a buffer system.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles for each component:\n*   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n*   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n\nNext, we determine the molar concentrations of the ions H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ in the 200.00 cm³ (0.20000 L) solution.\n*   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n*   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\nThis mixture constitutes a buffer solution where H₂PO₄⁻ is the weak acid and HPO₄²⁻ is its conjugate base. The equilibrium governing this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸. We can find the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] using the Ka₂ expression:\n\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for [H⁺]:\n\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this is Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹². The expression for Ka₃ is:\n\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nNow, we can solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻]. We assume the equilibrium concentration of HPO₄²⁻ is approximately its initial concentration (0.02809 M), as the very small value of Ka₃ indicates minimal dissociation.\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nTherefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>"
