    "Here's a breakdown of the chemical reactions and chromatographic analysis to determine the number of peaks.\n\n### Reaction I\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a powerful reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material has a stereocenter, the formation of a new stereocenter can lead to diastereomers. The attack of the hydride on the carbonyl carbon at C3 can occur from two different faces, producing two different configurations at C3 (R and S). This results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### Reaction II\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Transformation:** The reduction of both ketones produces pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4. Three possible stereoisomers can be formed:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (which is identical to the 2S, 4R isomer due to a plane of symmetry).\n    The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. In total, three distinct stereoisomers are produced.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nAfter combining the products from both reactions, the mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their polarity.\n\n*   Structurally different compounds, like the methoxyhexanol products from Reaction I and the pentanediol products from Reaction II, will have different polarities and will be separated.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties, including polarity, and can therefore be separated by normal-phase HPLC.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will give **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them, giving **one peak**.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated by a normal-phase column.\n    *   The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute, producing **one single peak**.\n\nCounting the peaks for the normal-phase HPLC: two from Reaction I + two from Reaction II (one for the enantiomeric pair and one for the meso compound) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC**\nA chiral stationary phase is designed to interact differently with different stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n\n*   The five distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will each interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   This results in the separation of all five compounds.\n\nCounting the peaks for the chiral HPLC: two diastereomers from Reaction I + three stereoisomers (one enantiomeric pair and one meso compound) from Reaction II = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nTherefore, the chemist observes 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>"
