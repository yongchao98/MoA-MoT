    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is built upon the foundational principles of the Standard Model (SM), extending it to include higher-dimensional operators that describe the effects of new physics at higher energy scales. The construction of these operators must adhere to certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** The SMEFT is formulated as a local quantum field theory that is invariant under Lorentz transformations. This is a core assumption in its construction.\n\n2.  **Poincare symmetry:** Poincare symmetry encompasses Lorentz symmetry (boosts and rotations) as well as spacetime translations. As a Lorentz-invariant field theory, the SMEFT Lagrangian is also invariant under the full Poincare group.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry:** CP symmetry (the combination of charge conjugation and parity) is not a required symmetry for all operators in the SMEFT. In fact, the SMEFT provides a framework for studying potential new sources of CP violation beyond what is present in the Standard Model. Numerous studies focus on classifying and constraining these CP-violating operators.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory and states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). Since the SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT would necessitate a violation of Lorentz invariance.\n\nTherefore, Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry are all required symmetries for every operator within the SMEFT framework.\n\n<<<D>>>"
