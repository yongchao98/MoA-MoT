    "To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and assess the renormalizability of the theory, we follow a two-step process:\n\n### 1. Mass Dimension of κ\n\nFirst, we determine the mass dimensions of each component in the interaction Lagrangian, \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\\). In natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action \\(S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}\\) is dimensionless. Since the spacetime volume element \\(d^4x\\) has a mass dimension of [x]⁴ = (Mass⁻¹)⁴ = -4, the Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\nThe mass dimensions of the fields are derived from their kinetic terms:\n*   **Fermion field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion is \\(\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi\\). For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, given that [\\(\\partial_\\mu\\)] = 1, the dimension of \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\psi\\) must be 3. This implies that the fermion field ψ (and \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\)) has a mass dimension of [ψ] = 3/2.\n*   **Field strength tensor (F<sup>µν</sup>):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is \\(-\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}\\). For this to have a dimension of 4, [F<sup>µν</sup>]² must be 4, which means the field strength tensor has a mass dimension of [F<sup>µν</sup>] = 2.\n*   **Sigma tensor (\\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\)):** The term \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]\\) is composed of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless constants. Therefore, [\\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\)] = 0.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation for the dimensions of the interaction Lagrangian:\n\\[ [\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] + [\\psi] + [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4 \\]\nPlugging in the known dimensions:\n\\[ [\\kappa] + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4 \\]\n\\[ [\\kappa] + 3 + 2 = 4 \\]\n\\[ [\\kappa] + 5 = 4 \\]\n\\[ [\\kappa] = -1 \\]\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n### 2. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be assessed using a method called power-counting. A key criterion for determining if a theory is renormalizable is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension, the interaction is *super-renormalizable*.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **zero** mass dimension, the interaction is *renormalizable*.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension, the interaction is *non-renormalizable*.\n\nSince the coupling constant κ has a mass dimension of -1, the theory is non-renormalizable. In such theories, higher-order corrections in perturbation theory lead to divergences that cannot be absorbed by redefining a finite number of parameters in the Lagrangian, thus requiring an infinite number of counterterms.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is non-renormalizable. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
