    "### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Structure of the Starting Compound (C8H9NO):**\n    *   The molecular formula C8H9NO has a degree of unsaturation of 5. This is consistent with a benzene ring (4 degrees) and an aldehyde group (1 degree).\n    *   The ¹H-NMR data points to specific structural features:\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Its splitting into a triplet (t) indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This corresponds to a -CH₂- group. Its splitting into a doublet (d) confirms it is adjacent to the aldehyde's -CH group. This establishes a -CH₂-CHO fragment (acetaldehyde side chain).\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are characteristic of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region is typical for a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) group.\n    *   Assembling these pieces, the starting compound is identified as **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**. The amine group (-NH₂) and the acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO) are in a para position on the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Step-by-Step Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   **Step 1 (NaNO₂ + HCl):** This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The product of this step is 2-(4-diazoniumchlorophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n    *   **Step 2 (H₂O):** Adding water to the diazonium salt and typically warming it results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This reaction forms **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n    *   **Step 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** This step involves an aldol condensation reaction under basic conditions with heat. Two molecules of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde react with each other.\n        *   First, the base (KOH) removes an acidic α-proton (from the -CH₂- group) of one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate.\n        *   This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, specifically **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C). This is the aldol *addition* product.\n        *   Given the presence of **heat**, this intermediate undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The dehydration is favored because it results in a more stable, conjugated system. The final product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This process of addition followed by dehydration is known as aldol condensation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the spectroscopic data and the reaction sequence, the final product is the result of a diazotization, hydrolysis, and subsequent self-aldol condensation. The heat applied in the final step drives the reaction to completion, favoring the dehydrated and highly conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde over the simple aldol addition product.\n\nThus, the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
