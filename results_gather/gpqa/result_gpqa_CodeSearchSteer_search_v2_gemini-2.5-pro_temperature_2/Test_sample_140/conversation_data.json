    "When 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia, the reaction proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible products can be determined by considering all potential pathways.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron in this case) from a carbon atom ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. There are two such positions in the starting material:\n\n1.  **Abstraction of Hydrogen (H) from C6:** The amide ion can remove the hydrogen atom from the C6 position. This is generally faster than removing deuterium due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker and breaks more easily than the C-D bond). This elimination results in the formation of **3-deuteriobenzyne**, an intermediate where the deuterium atom is still present at position C3 relative to the benzyne \"triple\" bond.\n2.  **Abstraction of Deuterium (D) from C2:** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from the C2 position. While slower, this pathway is still possible. The elimination of the deuteron and the bromide ion results in the formation of a standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Addition of Nucleophile to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the highly reactive benzyne intermediates.\n\n1.  **Attack on 3-deuteriobenzyne:** This intermediate is asymmetric. The nucleophile can attack either of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond, leading to two different products after protonation by the ammonia solvent.\n    *   Attack at one carbon results in the formation of **1-amino-2-deuterobenzene** (ortho-deuterioaniline).\n    *   Attack at the other carbon yields **1-amino-3-deuterobenzene** (meta-deuterioaniline).\n\n2.  **Attack on non-deuterated benzyne:** This intermediate is symmetric. Attack by the amide nucleophile at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to a single product: **aniline** (which contains no deuterium).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the outcomes of all possible pathways, three distinct organic products can be formed:\n\n*   1-amino-2-deuterobenzene\n*   1-amino-3-deuterobenzene\n*   Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
