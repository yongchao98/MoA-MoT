    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we first need to identify the color of the light it emits. From there, we can find the complementary color, which corresponds to the color absorbed.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Wavelength of Emitted Light\nThe energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. The relationship between a photon's energy (E) and its wavelength (λ) is described by Planck's equation. A simplified and useful version of this equation is:\n\nλ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV)\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the wavelength:\n\nλ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 529.9 nm, which is approximately 530 nm.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Color of the Emitted Light\nThe visible light spectrum maps wavelengths to the colors perceived by the human eye. A wavelength of 530 nm falls within the green region of the visible spectrum. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light, and this is the color it would appear to an observer.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Absorbed Color\nThe color an object appears to be is the result of the wavelengths of light it reflects or transmits; the light that is absorbed is not seen. The color that is absorbed is the complementary color to the color that is perceived.\n\nLooking at a color wheel or a chart of complementary colors, the color complementary to green (500-560 nm) is red or red-violet. When a substance absorbs red light, the remaining light it reflects appears green.\n\n### Conclusion\n1.  The dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 530 nm.\n2.  Light with a wavelength of 530 nm is green.\n3.  The absorbed color is complementary to the emitted color.\n4.  The complementary color of green is red.\n\nTherefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<C>>>"
