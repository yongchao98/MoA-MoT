    "The reaction pathway is confirmed by the search results.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine -> Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone)**\n    This is a standard alpha-bromination of a ketone.\n\n*   **Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone + NaOH (heat) -> Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid)**\n    The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a base like NaOH is known as the Favorskii rearrangement. In the case of cyclic α-halo ketones, this rearrangement results in a ring contraction. For 2-bromocyclohexanone, the product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. This pathway is much more likely than a simple elimination, especially given the subsequent reaction step.\n\n*   **Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + SOCl2, pyridine -> Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride)**\n    Carboxylic acids react with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) to form acid chlorides. This is a standard and high-yielding conversion.\n\n*   **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride -> Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde)**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(Ot-Bu)₃) is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than LiAlH₄, which allows the reaction to stop at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to the alcohol. The final product is cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde)**\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine the structure of cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde for symmetry.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO) and the C1 carbon it's attached to, bisecting the C3-C4 bond.\n\nLet's number the carbons:\n*   C1 is the carbon attached to the aldehyde group.\n*   C2 and C5 are adjacent to C1.\n*   C3 and C4 are adjacent to C2 and C5, respectively.\n\nThe distinct sets of hydrogen atoms are:\n1.  **The aldehyde hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is unique. (1 hydrogen)\n2.  **The hydrogen on C1:** This hydrogen is attached to a carbon that is bonded to the aldehyde and two other carbons in the ring. It is unique. (1 hydrogen)\n3.  **The hydrogens on C2 and C5:** These two positions are chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic. One is cis to the aldehyde group, and one is trans. Due to symmetry, the cis-hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the cis-hydrogen on C5, and the trans-hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the trans-hydrogen on C5. This gives two distinct sets of hydrogens. (2 hydrogens in each set)\n4.  **The hydrogens on C3 and C4:** Similar to C2 and C5, these two positions are equivalent due to symmetry. The two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic. The cis-hydrogens on C3 and C4 are equivalent, and the trans-hydrogens on C3 and C4 are equivalent. This gives another two distinct sets of hydrogens. (2 hydrogens in each set)\n\nIn total, the number of sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nC) 6\n\n<<<C>>>"
