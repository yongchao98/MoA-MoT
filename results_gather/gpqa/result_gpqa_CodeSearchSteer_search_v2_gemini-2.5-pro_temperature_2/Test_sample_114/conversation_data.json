    "### Calculation Confirms Angle of Photon Emission in Electron-Positron Annihilation\n\nWhen an electron and a positron with different initial energies collide and annihilate, the resulting photons are emitted at a specific angle that can be determined through the principles of special relativity. For an electron with a Lorentz factor of 4 and a positron with a Lorentz factor of 2 colliding head-on, the angle between the two resulting photons of equal energy is approximately 138 degrees.\n\nThe calculation relies on the fundamental laws of conservation of energy and momentum. First, the total energy and momentum of the electron-positron system before the collision are determined. The electron and positron are antiparticles, meaning they have the same mass but opposite charge.\n\nThe energy of a relativistic particle is given by the equation E = γmc², where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light. The momentum is given by p = γmv, where `v` is the particle's velocity.\n\n**Initial State (Before Collision):**\n*   **Electron:** With a Lorentz factor (γ_e) of 4, its total energy is 4 times its rest energy (4m_ec²). Its momentum is directed along the horizontal axis and calculated to be sqrt(15)m_ec.\n*   **Positron:** With a Lorentz factor (γ_p) of 2, its energy is 2m_ec². Since it's moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is -sqrt(3)m_ec.\n\nThe total initial energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies:\nE_initial = 4m_ec² + 2m_ec² = 6m_ec²\n\nThe total initial momentum is the sum of the individual momenta:\nP_initial = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))m_ec\n\n**Final State (After Annihilation):**\nThe annihilation produces two photons of equal energy (E_γ). To conserve the initial momentum, which is non-zero, the photons must be emitted at an angle to the original axis of motion. Due to the symmetry of the problem and the equal energy of the photons, if one photon is emitted at an angle θ relative to the horizontal axis, the other must be emitted at an angle -θ.\n\nThe total final energy is the sum of the energies of the two photons:\nE_final = 2E_γ\n\nThe total final momentum in the direction of the initial motion is:\nP_final = 2 * (E_γ / c) * cos(θ)\n\n**Applying Conservation Laws:**\nBy conserving energy (E_initial = E_final), we find the energy of each photon:\n6m_ec² = 2E_γ  => E_γ = 3m_ec²\n\nBy conserving momentum (P_initial = P_final), we can solve for the angle θ:\n(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))m_ec = 2 * (3m_ec² / c) * cos(θ)\n(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))m_ec = 6m_ec * cos(θ)\ncos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n\nThis gives an angle θ of approximately 69.1 degrees. The question asks for the angle between the two photons, which is 2θ.\n\nAngle = 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis result aligns with the provided option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
