    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles—isolated North or South poles—exist, two of Maxwell's equations would need to be modified.\n\nIn our universe, magnets are always dipoles (having both a North and a South pole), which is reflected in the current form of Maxwell's equations. Specifically, Gauss's law for magnetism states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, signifying the absence of magnetic \"charges\" or monopoles.\n\nIf magnetic monopoles were to exist, they would act as sources for the magnetic field, similar to how electric charges are sources for the electric field. This would necessitate changes to the following two equations:\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (Divergence of the Magnetic Field):** This law is currently expressed as ∇ ⋅ B = 0, indicating no magnetic monopoles. If monopoles existed, this equation would be modified to ∇ ⋅ B = ρₘ (multiplied by a constant), where ρₘ represents the magnetic charge density. This change reflects that magnetic field lines can begin or end on magnetic charges.\n\n2.  **Faraday's Law of Induction (Circulation/Curl of the Electric Field):** This law, ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t, describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, a moving magnetic monopole would constitute a \"magnetic current\" (Jₘ). This magnetic current would also create a circulating electric field, requiring the equation to be modified to include this new term, for instance: ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - Jₘ.\n\nTherefore, the two laws that would change are the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the one related to the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<A>>>"
