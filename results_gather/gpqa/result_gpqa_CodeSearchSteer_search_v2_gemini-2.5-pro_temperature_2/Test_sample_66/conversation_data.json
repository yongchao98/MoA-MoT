    "In quantum mechanics, the combination of two angular momenta, represented by `l_1` and `l_2`, results in a total angular momentum `l`. The z-component of this total angular momentum, `m`, is the sum of the individual z-components, `m_1` and `m_2`. This principle is a fundamental rule in the addition of angular momenta.\n\nThe state of the two-electron system is given as `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. This notation indicates that the total angular momentum quantum number `l` is 2, and the quantum number for its z-component `m` is -1.\n\nA measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components, `L_1z` and `L_2z`, will yield eigenvalues corresponding to the quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2`. The question asks for the joint probability of obtaining eigenvalues of `-ħ` for both `L_1z` and `L_2z`. This corresponds to measurement outcomes of `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n\nAccording to the rules of angular momentum addition, the total z-component quantum number `m` must equal the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2`. Therefore, the condition `m = m_1 + m_2` must be satisfied.\n\nIn this scenario:\n*   The system is in a state with `m = -1`.\n*   The desired measurement outcome is `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n\nCalculating the sum of the desired outcomes: `m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\nThis sum `(-2)` does not match the system's total z-component quantum number `(-1)`. This discrepancy means that it is physically impossible to obtain this specific measurement result from the given initial state. The probability of an event that violates this conservation principle is zero.\n\nThis can be formally understood using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which give the probability amplitudes for finding the system in a specific uncoupled state `|l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2>`. The coefficient is non-zero only if `m = m_1 + m_2`. Since `-1 ≠ -2`, the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero, and thus the probability is also zero.\n\n<<<B>>>"
