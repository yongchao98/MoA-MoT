    "To determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must assess two main criteria for each star: its observability from Paranal Observatory and whether its brightness allows for the required signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nA star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel can be achieved in a one-hour exposure using a single 8.2m VLT Unit Telescope (1-UT mode). According to documentation from the European Southern Observatory (ESO), this S/N level in a one-hour exposure is achievable for stars with an apparent visual magnitude (V) up to approximately 17.\n\nThe second criterion is the star's position in the sky. Paranal Observatory is located in Chile at a latitude of about -24.6 degrees. Due to the Earth's curvature, and the physical limits of the telescope's mount, only stars within a certain declination range are visible. The VLTs have a general zenith distance limit of 70 degrees, which means they can observe stars with declinations up to approximately +45.4 degrees.\n\nHere is a star-by-star evaluation:\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Observability**: Canopus has a declination of approximately -52° 42'. As a bright star in the southern sky, it is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability**: Its apparent visual magnitude is -0.74, making it the second brightest star in the night sky. Since -0.74 is much brighter than the limiting magnitude of 17, Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Observability**: Polaris, the North Star, is located very close to the north celestial pole, with a declination of about +89° 16'. This is far north of the ~+45.4° declination limit for Paranal. Therefore, Polaris is **not observable** from the VLT.\n*   **Detectability**: Since it is not observable, it is not detectable, regardless of its brightness.\n\n**c) Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag at 10 pc**\n*   **Observability**: The star's declination is given as 0 degrees, which is readily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability**: To determine its detectability, we calculate its apparent magnitude (m) using the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) with the distance modulus formula: `m - M = 5 * log10(d/10)`.\n    *   Given M = 15 and d = 10 pc, the formula simplifies to `m - 15 = 5 * log10(1)`, which is `m - 15 = 0`.\n    *   Therefore, the apparent magnitude `m` is 15.\n    *   Since m = 15 is less than or equal to the limit of 17, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag at 200 pc**\n*   **Observability**: The star's declination is 0 degrees, making it observable.\n*   **Detectability**: We calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   `m - 15 = 5 * log10(200/10) = 5 * log10(20) = 5 * 1.301 ≈ 6.5`\n    *   This gives an apparent magnitude of `m ≈ 15 + 6.5 = 21.5`.\n    *   An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is much fainter than the limit of 17, so this star is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag at 5 pc**\n*   **Observability**: The declination is 0 degrees, so it is observable.\n*   **Detectability**: We calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   `m - 15 = 5 * log10(5/10) = 5 * log10(0.5) = 5 * (-0.301) ≈ -1.5`\n    *   This gives an apparent magnitude of `m ≈ 15 - 1.5 = 13.5`.\n    *   An apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than 17, making this star **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag at 50 pc**\n*   **Observability**: With a declination of 0 degrees, it is observable.\n*   **Detectability**: We calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   `m - 15 = 5 * log10(50/10) = 5 * log10(5) = 5 * 0.699 ≈ 3.5`\n    *   This results in an apparent magnitude of `m ≈ 15 + 3.5 = 18.5`.\n    *   Since 18.5 is fainter than the V=17 limit, this star is **not detectable**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on this analysis, the stars that are detectable with the ESPRESSO spectrograph under the specified conditions are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  The star at 10 pc (m = 15)\n3.  The star at 5 pc (m ≈ 13.5)\n\nIn total, 3 of the listed stars would be detectable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
