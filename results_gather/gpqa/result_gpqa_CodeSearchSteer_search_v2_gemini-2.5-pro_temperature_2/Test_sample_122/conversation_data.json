    "This problem requires the application of the theory of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Identify Given Information:**\n*   **Velocity of the ejecta (v):** 60,000 km/s\n*   **Time passed in the ejecta's reference frame (t₀ or proper time):** 50 s\n*   **The speed of light in a vacuum (c):** approximately 300,000 km/s\n\n**2. The Concept of Time Dilation:**\nAccording to Einstein's special theory of relativity, an observer in a stationary reference frame will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object than for themselves. This effect, known as time dilation, is significant at speeds approaching the speed of light. The time measured in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will be longer than the time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta).\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor determines the magnitude of time dilation and length contraction. The formula for the Lorentz factor is:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n*   First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n    v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n*   Next, square this ratio:\n    (v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04\n*   Now, substitute this value into the Lorentz factor formula:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)\n    γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798\n    γ ≈ 1.0206\n\n**4. Calculate Time in the Galaxy's Reference Frame:**\nThe time dilation formula relates the time in the moving frame (t₀) to the time in the stationary frame (t):\nt = γ * t₀\n\n*   Using the calculated Lorentz factor and the given time:\n    t ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s\n    t ≈ 51.03 s\n\nThis means that while 50 seconds have passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's frame would measure approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\n**5. Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame:**\nFinally, calculate the distance the ejecta traveled as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame using the classic distance formula (distance = velocity × time).\n\n*   Distance = v * t\n*   Distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s\n*   Distance ≈ 3,061,800 km\n\nThis calculated distance is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
