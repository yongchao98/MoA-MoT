    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each group directs incoming electrophiles during electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and an *ortho-, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the General Synthetic Strategy**\n\nSynthesizing a molecule with three deactivating groups (or two deactivating and one weakly deactivating like -Br) is challenging.\n*   **Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation) fail on moderately to strongly deactivated rings.** This means a group like -NO2 or even -Br and -NO2 together on a ring will prevent the addition of an acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts acylation. Therefore, the acetyl group must be added before the ring becomes too deactivated.\n*   **The 1,3,5-substitution pattern is key.** This pattern is difficult to achieve directly when starting from benzene. Often, it requires a multi-step synthesis involving a temporary directing group that is later removed or modified. The sequence `Fe/HCl` (reduction of NO2 to NH2), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization of NH2), and `H3PO2` (deamination, replacing N2+ with H) is a classic method for removing a nitro group that was used as a temporary directing group.\n\n**4. Analyze the Given Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on these principles.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...**\n    This sequence starts by nitrating benzene to form nitrobenzene. Then, steps ii, iii, and iv are the exact sequence to reduce the nitro group to an amine, diazotize it, and then remove it, converting nitrobenzene back to benzene. This is a circular and pointless sequence. So, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    Step i) forms bromobenzene. Step ii) nitrates bromobenzene, primarily at the para position, to give 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. Step iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The starting material for this step, 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, has two deactivating groups (-Br and -NO2). The ring is strongly deactivated, and **Friedel-Crafts acylation will not work**. So, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    Step i) forms nitrobenzene. Step ii) reduces it to aniline. Step iii) is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline. This reaction is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a positively charged complex `(-NH2-AlCl3)`. This complex is a very strong deactivating, *meta*-directing group. Even if the reaction were to proceed, the subsequent steps would not lead to the desired isomer. So, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step.\n    *   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position. This step is regiochemically sound.\n    *   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration:** Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has two substituents: -COCH3 (at C1, *meta*-director) and -Br (at C3, *ortho-, para*-director).\n        *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position C5.\n        *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group to positions C2, C4, and C6.\n        This is a case of conflicting directing effects. In such cases, a mixture of isomers is typically formed, and the reaction is not \"high-yield\" for any single isomer. The desired 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone is expected to be a minor product.\n    *   **iv) - vii):** The subsequent steps (reduction, another nitration, diazotization, deamination) appear to be a convoluted and nonsensical sequence that does not logically follow from the previous step to yield the final product.\n\n**5. Conclusion by Elimination**\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect due to fundamental chemical principles (circular synthesis or failing reactions). Option A describes a sequence where the first three steps could, in principle, form the desired product, although not in high yield due to poor regioselectivity in the final nitration step. The remaining steps (iv-vii) in option A are extraneous and likely included as distractors or indicate a poorly constructed question. However, among the given choices, the sequence `Acylation → Bromination → Nitration` is the only one that doesn't involve a failing reaction or a logically impossible loop. By eliminating the clearly incorrect options, Option A remains as the most plausible, albeit flawed, answer. It's common in multiple-choice questions for the \"best\" answer to be chosen over perfectly ideal ones. The initial steps of A are the most chemically reasonable start towards the target molecule compared to the other options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
