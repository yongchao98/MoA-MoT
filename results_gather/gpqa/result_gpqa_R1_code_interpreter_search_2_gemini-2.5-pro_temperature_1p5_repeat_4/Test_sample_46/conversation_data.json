    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get an idea of the rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct peaks in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). A secondary amine (-NHR) would show only one peak.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester C=O group. It's slightly low for a simple alkyl ester (~1735-1750 cm-1) because conjugation with the benzene ring lowers the frequency. It is too high for an amide, which usually appears at a lower frequency (~1650-1690 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n        *   The integration of 3H suggests a methyl group (-CH3).\n        *   The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it's adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2), i.e., a -CH2- group.\n        *   This fragment is a -CH2-CH3, an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n        *   The integration of 2H suggests a methylene group (-CH2-).\n        *   The multiplicity is a quartet (q), which means it's adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3), i.e., a -CH3 group.\n        *   This confirms the ethyl group (-CH2-CH3) identified from the signal at 1.20 ppm.\n        *   The chemical shift is quite high (downfield) at 4.5 ppm. This indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH2-).\n        *   So far, we have identified an ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl: -CO-O-CH2-CH3.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n        *   The integration of 2H corresponds to the two protons of the -NH2 group, which was identified from the IR spectrum.\n        *   The signal is a broad singlet (bs), which is very typical for amine protons due to proton exchange and quadrupolar broadening from the nitrogen atom.\n        *   Its position at 4.0 ppm is consistent with an amino group attached directly to an aromatic ring.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n        *   These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm) and integrate to a total of 4 protons, confirming the presence of a substituted benzene ring.\n        *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is highly characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are further downfield (more deshielded), so they must be ortho (adjacent) to the strongly electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n        *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are further upfield (more shielded), so they must be ortho (adjacent) to the electron-donating amino group (-NH2).\n\n*   **Putting It All Together**\n    *   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   This combination forms the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Checking the Alternatives**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The NMR would show an O-aryl linkage, not an O-alkyl linkage for the ester. The CH2 group of the propionate would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: The IR would show an amide C=O (~1680 cm-1), not an ester C=O (1720 cm-1). The aromatic NMR pattern would be for 1,3-substitution, not 1,4-substitution.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: The IR would show a secondary amide (one N-H band), not a primary amine (two N-H bands). The NMR would show a formyl proton (-CHO) singlet around 8-8.5 ppm and a single N-H proton.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: The structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
