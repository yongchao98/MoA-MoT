    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Observations:**\n    *   **Observation 1 (Â¹H NMR):** There are two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   They have similar chemical shifts.\n        *   Their integrals are roughly equal and sum to the expected value of one proton (1H). This implies a roughly 1:1 mixture of two different species, both of which contain this alpha-proton.\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so the splitting is not due to neighboring protons.\n    *   **Observation 2 (LC-MS):**\n        *   The sample separates into two distinct peaks on the liquid chromatography (LC) column. This means there are two different compounds in the mixture that have different interactions with the column's stationary phase.\n        *   The peaks have equal intensities, reinforcing the idea of a ~1:1 mixture.\n        *   The mass spectrometry (MS) data for *both* LC peaks is identical and matches the expected mass of the target molecule. This is a critical piece of information: the two compounds are isomers (they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass).\n    *   **Context:** The compound is a chemically synthesized peptide. This is relevant because certain side reactions are common in peptide synthesis. The analysis is on the \"crude\" compound, so purification has not yet occurred.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Possible Explanations:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor molecule from the synthesis would almost certainly have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass. The MS data shows both peaks have the *same* mass as the final product, which contradicts this explanation.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   **NMR:** In a standard (achiral) solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and produce identical NMR spectra. You would only see one set of peaks, not two.\n        *   **LC:** Standard LC (using an achiral stationary phase) cannot separate enantiomers. They would elute together as a single peak.\n        *   Since the observations include two NMR peaks and two LC peaks under standard-assumed conditions, this explanation is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** \"Double coupling\" means an extra amino acid was added, creating a longer peptide. This would result in a molecule with a significantly higher mass. The MS data, which shows the *expected* mass for both peaks, rules this out.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images.\n        *   **Formation:** In peptide synthesis, if one of the chiral amino acids (which are almost always used in an optically pure form, e.g., L-amino acids) undergoes racemization at its alpha-carbon during a reaction step (a common side-reaction called epimerization), a diastereomer is formed. For example, synthesizing L-Ala-L-Phe could yield some L-Ala-D-Phe. These two molecules are diastereomers. Another common source of diastereomers in peptides is restricted rotation around a peptide bond (especially X-Proline bonds), leading to *cis* and *trans* rotamers, which are also diastereomers.\n        *   **Properties:** Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are different chemical environments, diastereomers give distinct NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons would have slightly different chemical shifts, explaining the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC:** Their different physical properties mean they interact differently with the LC column and can be separated, explaining the two LC peaks.\n        *   **MS:** By definition, diastereomers have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass, which is perfectly consistent with the MS data.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The presence of two separable isomers of the same mass that are distinguishable by NMR is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereomers. This is a common outcome in peptide synthesis due to epimerization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
