    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The \"Galaxy reference frame\" is the stationary frame (let's call it S).\n    *   The \"ejecta reference frame\" is the moving frame (let's call it S').\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the **proper time** (`Δt_0`), as it's measured by a clock that is moving with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the **Galaxy reference frame**. Let's call this distance `D`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The distance traveled in any frame is calculated as `Distance = speed × time`. In the Galaxy frame, this is `D = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame.\n    *   We cannot use the 50 seconds directly, as that time was measured in the ejecta's frame. We need to find the corresponding time interval `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame using the principle of **time dilation**.\n    *   The time dilation formula states that time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is longer than the proper time (`Δt_0`) measured in the moving frame. The relationship is:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt_0`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 5a: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step 5b: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step 5c: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (Δt).**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt_0 = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step 5d: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (D).**\n        `D = v * Δt`\n        `D = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        `D = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `D = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    Now, let's compute the numerical value for the distance. I will use a python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # speed in km/s\nt_proper = 50  # proper time in seconds\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s\n\n# The distance in the Galaxy reference frame is D = v * t_galaxy.\n# The time in the Galaxy reference frame (t_galaxy) is related to the proper time in the ejecta's frame (t_proper) by time dilation: t_galaxy = gamma * t_proper.\n# The Lorentz factor, gamma, is 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).\n# Combining these, we get: D = v * (t_proper / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2))\n\ndistance_galaxy = (v * t_proper) / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\nprint(distance_galaxy)\n```\n<execute_result>\n3061862.1784788196\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 2,940,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the result if relativistic effects were ignored).\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option D, `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is likely due to the rounding of values in the problem statement or the options.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:** We have two inertial frames of reference.\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame, and the time measurement of 50 seconds is made in this frame.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity between the frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time elapsed in the moving frame (ejecta's frame), `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the **proper time**, denoted as `Δt_0`, because it's the time measured by a clock at rest relative to the event (the ejecta's travel).\n    *   The speed of light, `c` = 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `D` that the ejecta travels as measured in the **Galaxy frame (S)**.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Physics:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy frame is given by the formula `D = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy frame.\n    *   The problem provides the time in the ejecta's frame (`Δt_0`), not the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`). Due to the principles of Special Relativity, these two times are not the same.\n    *   We must use the **time dilation** formula to find the time `Δt` in the Galaxy frame corresponding to the 50 seconds that passed in the ejecta's frame.\n    *   The time dilation formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt_0`\n    *   Where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation Steps:**\n\n    *   **Step 5a: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        First, find the ratio of the velocity to the speed of light, `β = v/c`:\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n        Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step 5b: Calculate the time `Δt` in the Galaxy frame.**\n        Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt_0 = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step 5c: Calculate the distance `D` in the Galaxy frame.**\n        Using the distance formula `D = v * Δt`:\n        `D = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        `D = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `D = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    The code execution performed this calculation precisely:\n    `distance_galaxy = (60000 * 50) / sqrt(1 - (60000/300000)**2)`\n    The output `3061862.178... km` is the computed distance.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 2,940,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the non-relativistic answer, `60,000 * 50`).\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\n    Our calculated value of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to option D, 3,060,000 km. The slight difference is negligible and likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
