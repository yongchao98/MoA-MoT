    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the given relationship.**\nThe problem states that the number of stars, `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, according to the relation:\n`N ∝ 1 / plx^5`\n\nIn astronomical contexts, when discussing star counts as a function of a limiting parameter (like magnitude or parallax), \"the number of stars\" typically refers to the **cumulative count**. Therefore, we interpret the given relation as the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than* a certain value `plx`. Let's denote this cumulative number as `N(>plx)`.\n\nSo, `N(>plx) ∝ 1 / plx^5`.\n\n**Step 2: Relate parallax to distance.**\nParallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`r`). The standard formula is:\n`plx = 1 / r`\n\n**Step 3: Express the number of stars as a function of distance.**\nWe want to find how the number of stars depends on distance `r`. We can substitute the parallax-distance relationship into our initial expression.\n\nA parallax greater than `plx` corresponds to a distance *less than* `r = 1/plx`. So, the cumulative number of stars within a distance `r`, denoted `N(<r)`, is equivalent to `N(>plx)`.\n\nSubstitute `plx = 1/r` into the relation from Step 1:\n`N(<r) ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n`N(<r) ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n`N(<r) ∝ r^5`\n\nThis means the total number of stars observed within a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of stars per unit range of distance.**\nThe question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This is equivalent to asking for the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `r` with thickness `dr`, divided by `dr`. Mathematically, this is the derivative of the cumulative number of stars `N(<r)` with respect to the distance `r`. Let's call this quantity `n(r)`.\n\n`n(r) = dN(<r) / dr`\n\nWe have the proportionality `N(<r) ∝ r^5`. Let's write this with a constant of proportionality, `C`:\n`N(<r) = C * r^5`\n\nNow, we differentiate this expression with respect to `r`:\n`n(r) = d/dr (C * r^5)`\nUsing the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx (x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`), we get:\n`n(r) = C * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n`n(r) = 5C * r^4`\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the final relationship.**\nFrom the result in Step 4, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance, `n(r)`, is proportional to `r^4`:\n`n(r) ∝ r^4`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
