    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given information from the 1H NMR spectrum.**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n*   The fact that all signals are singlets indicates there is no proton-proton coupling between adjacent non-equivalent protons.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the predicted 1H NMR spectrum for each of the possible compounds.**\n\nLet's analyze each compound's structure and symmetry to predict its NMR signals.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. This matches.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. This matches.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2-C5 axis.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (6H total).\n        *   The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This will result in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. This matches.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the bond between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent by symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H total).\n        *   The methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H total).\n        *   This will result in **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. This matches.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups will show splitting. The two -CH2- groups are equivalent and adjacent to -CH3 groups, so they will appear as a **quartet** (4H). The two -CH3 groups are equivalent and adjacent to -CH2- groups, so they will appear as a **triplet** (6H).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states all signals are singlets, 1,4-diethylbenzene is not one of the compounds. This eliminates option B.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture for each remaining option.**\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (1s, 2H) + Isodurene (2s, 1H each). This would give a total of three aromatic singlets, which contradicts the \"two signals\" information. (It could only give two signals if the 2H signal from Durene accidentally overlapped with one of the 1H signals from Isodurene, resulting in a 3:1 integration ratio, not 1:1).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene (1s, 12H) + Isodurene (3s, 6H, 3H, 3H). This would result in four signals, unless some signals overlap. This option is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Prehnitene (1s, 2H) + Isodurene (2s, 1H each). This would give a total of three aromatic singlets, which contradicts the data for the same reasons as option A.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Prehnitene (2s, 6H each) + Isodurene (3s, 6H, 3H, 3H). This would give up to five aliphatic signals. This is inconsistent.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Aromatic:**\n        *   Durene gives one singlet for 2H.\n        *   Prehnitene gives one singlet for 2H.\n        *   In a 1:1 mixture, this will result in **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. The integration ratio is 2H:2H = **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic:**\n        *   Durene gives one singlet for 12H.\n        *   Prehnitene gives two singlets, each for 6H.\n        *   In the mixture, these will combine to give a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only pair that perfectly reproduces the observed NMR spectrum without requiring any assumptions of accidental signal overlap.\n\n<<<D>>>"
