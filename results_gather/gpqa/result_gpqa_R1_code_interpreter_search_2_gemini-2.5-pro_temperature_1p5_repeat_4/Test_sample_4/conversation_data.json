    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the eigenvector.\n\n**1. Identify the Quantum Mechanical Operator**\n\nThe operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon. The components are given in terms of the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$):\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**2. Define the Direction Vector**\n\nThe direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in 3D is given in spherical coordinates as $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$. For the vector to be in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This happens when the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$.\nSo, the unit vector $\\vec{n}$ can be written as:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\nHere, $\\theta$ is the angle the vector $\\vec{n}$ makes with the positive z-axis.\n\n**3. Construct the Operator Along Direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x)(\\sin\\theta) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y)(0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z)(\\cos\\theta)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n\nNow, we substitute the matrix forms of the Pauli matrices:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. Let the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the ratio of $b$ to $a$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$b/a = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nUsing the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$b/a = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\nSo, $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\n\nThe eigenvector has the form:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\nWe can choose $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$ to make the form more symmetric:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2)/\\cos(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**5. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nThe normalization condition requires that the inner product of the eigenvector with itself is 1, i.e., $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\nThe vector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. Its components are real.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = (\\cos(\\theta/2))^* (\\cos(\\theta/2)) + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^* (\\sin(\\theta/2))$\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\nThe eigenvector is already normalized.\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\nComparing our result with the given choices:\nA) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$\nB) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$\nC) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$\nD) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$\n\nOur calculated eigenvector matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
