    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Products and Calculate Their Moles**\n\nThe problem describes the analysis of the gaseous products formed from heating the salt mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of this tube is equal to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.200 mol\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since its weight did not change, we can conclude that no CO₂ was produced in the decomposition. This rules out carbonates and oxalates as the original salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase is due to the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The gas that remains after passing through all three tubes is inert to all the reagents. It is given that its volume is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.100 mol\n    *   Given the context of heating nitrogen-containing salts (which are common), and that this gas is inert, the most plausible identity for Gas C is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nNow, let's find the total mass and elemental composition of the gaseous products to see if it matches the initial mass of the salts.\n\n*   **Mass of N₂ (Gas C):** 0.100 mol * 28.02 g/mol ≈ 2.80 g\n*   **Total mass of products:** Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(N₂) = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g), confirming our identification of the products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) and their quantities. The elements present in the original salts must be Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N).\n\n**3. Identify the Salts A and B**\n\nWe are looking for two salts, A and B, containing N, H, and O, that decompose upon heating. Common examples are ammonium salts like ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). Let's test this hypothesis.\n\n*   Hypothesis: Salt A is **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** and Salt B is **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\nLet's find their molar masses:\n*   Molar Mass of A (NH₄NO₂): 14.01 + 4*1.01 + 14.01 + 2*16.00 = 64.05 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of B (NH₄NO₃): 14.01 + 4*1.01 + 14.01 + 3*16.00 = 80.05 g/mol\n\nThe mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B. The total mass is 7.20 g.\n*   n * M_A + n * M_B = 7.20\n*   n * (64.05 + 80.05) = 7.20\n*   n * (144.10) = 7.20\n*   n = 7.20 / 144.10 ≈ 0.05 mol\n\nSo, the mixture consists of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\nNow let's check if the decomposition of this mixture yields the correct amount of products. The thermal decomposition reactions are:\n*   (A) NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   (B) 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g) (This reaction occurs at higher temperatures but fits the product profile)\n\nLet's calculate the products from our mixture:\n*   From 0.05 mol of A (NH₄NO₂):\n    *   Produces 0.05 mol N₂\n    *   Produces 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O\n*   From 0.05 mol of B (NH₄NO₃), using the stoichiometry (2 NH₄NO₃ produces 2 N₂ + 1 O₂ + 4 H₂O):\n    *   Produces 0.05 mol N₂\n    *   Produces (0.05 / 2) = 0.025 mol O₂\n    *   Produces 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O\n\nTotal products:\n*   **Total N₂:** 0.05 mol (from A) + 0.05 mol (from B) = 0.100 mol (Matches our calculation)\n*   **Total O₂:** 0.025 mol (from B) = 0.025 mol (Matches our calculation)\n*   **Total H₂O:** 0.10 mol (from A) + 0.10 mol (from B) = 0.200 mol (Matches our calculation)\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThe following python code can be used to verify the calculations:\n```python\n# --- Step 1: Moles of products ---\nmass_h2o = 3.60  # g\nmass_o2 = 0.80   # g\nvol_gas_c = 2.24 # L\n\nMM_h2o = 18.015 # g/mol\nMM_o2 = 32.00   # g/mol\nMM_n2 = 28.014  # g/mol\nvol_stp = 22.4  # L/mol\n\nmoles_h2o = mass_h2o / MM_h2o\nmoles_o2 = mass_o2 / MM_o2\nmoles_n2 = vol_gas_c / vol_stp\n\n# --- Step 2: Mass conservation check ---\ntotal_mass_products = (moles_h2o * MM_h2o) + (moles_o2 * MM_o2) + (moles_n2 * MM_n2)\n# print(f\"Total calculated product mass: {total_mass_products:.2f} g\") # Should be 7.20 g\n\n# --- Step 3: Identify salts and moles ---\nMM_NH4NO2 = 14.007 * 2 + 1.008 * 4 + 15.999 * 2 # 64.04\nMM_NH4NO3 = 14.007 * 2 + 1.008 * 4 + 15.999 * 3 # 80.04\ntotal_mass_salts = 7.20 # g\n\n# From n * (MM_A + MM_B) = 7.20\nn_moles_each = total_mass_salts / (MM_NH4NO2 + MM_NH4NO3)\n# print(f\"Calculated moles of each salt: {n_moles_each:.3f} mol\") # Should be ~0.050 mol\n\n# --- Step 4: Final Answer ---\n# Atoms in Salt A (NH4NO2) = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2\n# Atoms in Salt B (NH4NO3) = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3\n\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(total_atoms)\n```\n\n17\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, is heated, and the resulting gases are analyzed. Let's break down the information to identify the salts and solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases is passed through three tubes in sequence.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of this tube is equal to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) reacts with acidic gases like CO₂. The problem states that the weight of this tube did not change.\n    *   Conclusion: No CO₂ was produced. This means the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase is due to the oxygen consumed in the reaction.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n    *   The molar mass of O₂ is 32 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through the three tubes, the remaining gas does not react with a water absorber, a base, or hot copper. It is likely an inert gas.\n    *   Volume of Gas C at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given that the decomposition of salts containing nitrogen often produces nitrogen gas (N₂), and N₂ is inert under these conditions, we can identify Gas C as N₂.\n\n### **2. Verify the Composition and Mass**\n\nThe elements present in the gaseous products are hydrogen (from H₂O), oxygen (from H₂O and O₂), and nitrogen (from N₂). Therefore, the original salts A and B must be composed of N, H, and O.\n\nLet's check if the mass is conserved:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol × 28 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g), confirming that our identification of the products and their quantities is correct.\n\n### **3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe are looking for two salts containing N, H, and O that are in an equimolar mixture. Common salts that fit this description are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂). Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nThe thermal decomposition reactions are:\n*   Salt A (Hypothesis): NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Salt B (Hypothesis): 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThe mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol\n*   Total mass = n * (M_A) + n * (M_B) = n * (64.0 + 80.0) = 7.20 g\n*   n * 144.0 = 7.20\n*   n = 7.20 / 144.0 = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the mixture consists of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃. Let's see if this produces the correct amount of gas.\n\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂:\n    *   N₂ produced = 0.05 mol\n    *   H₂O produced = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio):\n    *   N₂ produced = 0.05 mol\n    *   O₂ produced = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol\n    *   H₂O produced = 4 * (0.05 / 2) = 0.10 mol\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   **Total H₂O** = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol (Matches our calculation)\n*   **Total O₂** = 0.025 mol (Matches our calculation)\n*   **Total N₂** = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches our calculation)\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The salts are A = NH₄NO₂ and B = NH₄NO₃.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n```python\n# Salt A is Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2)\n# N: 2, H: 4, O: 2\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2\n\n# Salt B is Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3)\n# N: 2, H: 4, O: 3\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3\n\n# Total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(total_atoms)\n```",
