    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic peak for the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded group. Its significant broadness strongly suggests a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl region and is typical for the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid (usually ~1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This is definitive proof of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group [COOH]⁺ (Carbon=12 + Oxygen=16 + Oxygen=16 + Hydrogen=1 = 45). This strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   From the FTIR and Mass Spec data, we can confidently conclude that the molecule contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: **C6H10O2** and **C6H12O2**.\n    *   The FTIR and 1H NMR data both confirm the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule, in addition to the C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid group.\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to Differentiate:**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    (Note: Oxygens do not affect the calculation).\n\n    *   Our identified functional groups require:\n        *   One pi bond for the C=O in the carboxylic acid (1 DoU).\n        *   One pi bond for the C=C alkene (1 DoU).\n        *   Therefore, the correct formula must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\n    *   Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n        *   **For C6H12O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n            This formula can only account for the C=O of the carboxylic acid. It represents a saturated C6 carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) and does not have the C=C double bond seen in the spectra.\n\n        *   **For C6H10O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n            This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accommodates both the C=O of the carboxylic acid and the C=C of the alkene group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the combined spectroscopic evidence, the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the chemical formula C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
