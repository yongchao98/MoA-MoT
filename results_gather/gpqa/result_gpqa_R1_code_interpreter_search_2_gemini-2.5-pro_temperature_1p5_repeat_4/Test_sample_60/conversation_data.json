    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical synthesis:\n\n**Step 1: Nitration of Benzene**\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene, Nitric Acid (HNO₃), and Sulfuric Acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Nitration).\n*   **Process:** Sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst, protonating nitric acid to form the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is a powerful electrophile. The benzene ring attacks the nitronium ion.\n*   **Product 1:** Nitrobenzene (C₆H₅NO₂).\n\n**Step 2: Bromination of Nitrobenzene**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Nitrobenzene), Bromine (Br₂), and Iron powder (Fe).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Process:** Iron powder acts as a Lewis acid catalyst with bromine to form the electrophile Br⁺. The nitro group (-NO₂) is a strong deactivating group and a meta-director. This means the incoming bromine atom will attach to the position *meta* (position 3) to the nitro group.\n*   **Product 2:** 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene (or m-bromonitrobenzene).\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Nitro Group**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene), Hydrogen gas (H₂), and Palladium on Carbon (Pd/C).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Catalytic Hydrogenation.\n*   **Process:** The nitro group (-NO₂) is reduced to a primary amino group (-NH₂) under these conditions. The C-Br bond remains intact.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-bromoaniline (or m-bromoaniline).\n\n**Step 4: Diazotization**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (3-bromoaniline), Sodium Nitrite (NaNO₂), and Fluoroboric acid (HBF₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Diazotization.\n*   **Process:** The primary aromatic amine is converted into a diazonium salt. In this case, fluoroboric acid is used, which forms a relatively stable aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborate salt.\n*   **Product 4:** 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate ([m-Br-C₆H₄-N₂]⁺[BF₄]⁻).\n\n**Step 5: Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 4 (3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate) and Anisole (methoxybenzene, C₆H₅OCH₃), with heating.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction (Aryl-aryl radical coupling).\n*   **Process:**\n    1.  Heating the diazonium salt causes it to decompose, releasing nitrogen gas (N₂) and forming a 3-bromophenyl radical (m-Br-C₆H₄•).\n    2.  This highly reactive aryl radical then attacks the anisole molecule.\n    3.  The methoxy group (-OCH₃) on anisole is an activating group and an ortho, para-director. It directs the incoming radical to the ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) positions.\n    4.  Due to the large size (steric hindrance) of the attacking 3-bromophenyl radical, the attack on the *para* position is strongly favored over the ortho position.\n    5.  The 3-bromophenyl radical couples with the anisole at its para position to form a new C-C bond, resulting in a substituted biphenyl.\n*   **Final Product (Product 5):** The product has two phenyl rings linked together. One ring has a bromine atom at position 3. The other ring has a methoxy group at position 4. This compound is named **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - This matches our derived product.\nB) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect. This would require a different reaction pathway.\nC) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect. This would be the minor product from ortho-attack.\nD) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect. This would have formed if the starting material was 4-bromoaniline.\n\nTherefore, the correct final product is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
