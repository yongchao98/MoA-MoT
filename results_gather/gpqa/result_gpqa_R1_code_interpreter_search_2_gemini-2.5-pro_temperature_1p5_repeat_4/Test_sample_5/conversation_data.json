    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n**1. Express the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n$V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)$\n\nTo solve this problem, it's often helpful to see if the potential simplifies in another coordinate system. Let's convert to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the standard transformations:\n$x = r cos(θ)$\n$y = r sin(θ)$\n$r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\nSubstitute these into the potential expression:\n$V(x, y) = 1/2 k (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k (r cos(θ))^2$\nSince $x = r cos(θ)$, the second term becomes $3/2 k x^2$.\n$V(x, y) = 1/2 k (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k x^2$\n\nNow, combine the terms:\n$V(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2$\n$V(x, y) = (4/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2$\n$V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2$\n\n**2. Identify the System**\n\nThe potential is now in the form:\n$V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$\nwhere $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$ and $V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2$.\n\nThis is the potential of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The motion is separable into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, one along the x-axis and one along the y-axis.\n\n**3. Solve the Schrödinger Equation**\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is:\n$Hψ = Eψ$\nwhere the Hamiltonian $H$ is:\n$H = - (ℏ^2 / 2m) (∂^2/∂x^2 + ∂^2/∂y^2) + V_x(x) + V_y(y)$\n\nBecause the potential is separable, the Hamiltonian is also separable ($H = H_x + H_y$), and the total energy E is the sum of the energies of the two independent oscillators:\n$E = E_x + E_y$\n\n**4. Find the Energy Eigenvalues for Each Oscillator**\n\nThe energy of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential $V(q) = 1/2 k_{eff} q^2$ is given by:\n$E_n = (n + 1/2) ℏω$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$ and the angular frequency is $ω = \\sqrt{k_{eff}/m}$.\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    $V_x(x) = 2kx^2 = 1/2 (4k) x^2$.\n    The effective spring constant is $k_x = 4k$.\n    The angular frequency is $ω_x = \\sqrt{k_x/m} = \\sqrt{4k/m} = 2\\sqrt{k/m}$.\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\n    $E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2) ℏω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2\\sqrt{k/m})$\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    $V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2$.\n    The effective spring constant is $k_y = k$.\n    The angular frequency is $ω_y = \\sqrt{k_y/m} = \\sqrt{k/m}$.\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\n    $E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2) ℏω_y = (n_y + 1/2) ℏ \\sqrt{k/m}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of $E_{n_x}$ and $E_{n_y}$:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$\n$E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2\\sqrt{k/m}) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ \\sqrt{k/m}$\n\nNow, factor out the common term $ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$:\n$E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$\n$E = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$\n$E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$.\nLet's compare this with the options provided:\nA) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nD) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
