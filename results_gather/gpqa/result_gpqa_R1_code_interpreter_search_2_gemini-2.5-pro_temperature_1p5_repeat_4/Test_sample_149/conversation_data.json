    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the initial compound from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2).\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation. A carbonyl group (C=O) from an aldehyde or ketone accounts for 1 degree. This adds up to 5, which matches the calculated DoU. This strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule. This points to a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH₂- group. Its integration is 2H. The splitting is a doublet (d), meaning it's adjacent to a carbon with one proton (a -CH- group). This confirms the `-CH₂-CHO` fragment, as the methylene protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a para (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region that integrates to 2H is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂). The broadness is due to hydrogen exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have the following pieces:\n    1.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₄)\n    2.  An amino group (-NH₂)\n    3.  A formylmethyl group (-CH₂CHO)\n    Putting these together, the only possible structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The formula is C₈H₉NO, which matches the given molecular formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: 1. NaNO₂ + HCl; 2. H₂O**\n    *   This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   Step 1 (NaNO₂, HCl): This is a diazotization reaction. The primary amine group (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate formed is 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    *   Step 2 (H₂O): The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water (usually with gentle warming) to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas (N₂).\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The substrate for this reaction is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This molecule possesses an aldehyde group and acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the carbon between the benzene ring and the carbonyl group).\n    *   The reagents are a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for a base-catalyzed **aldol condensation**. The reaction involves two molecules of the aldehyde.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻ from KOH) acts as a base and removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate ion.\n        2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms an alkoxide intermediate, which is then protonated by water to give an aldol addition product.\n            *   Aldol Adduct: `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal`. This corresponds to **Option C**.\n        3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The term \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions indicates that the reaction likely does not stop at the aldol addition stage. The aldol adduct readily eliminates a molecule of water (dehydration) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The proton on the α-carbon (C2) and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) are eliminated.\n            *   Aldol Condensation Product: `2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal`. This is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product among the given options.**\n\n*   The final product is the result of the full aldol condensation, which includes the dehydration step favored by heat.\n*   The structure of this product is `(HO-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=C(HO-C₆H₄)-CHO`.\n*   Let's check the name provided in **Option A**: `2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal`.\n    *   The parent chain is `but-2-enal`, a four-carbon chain with an aldehyde at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3.\n    *   There are two `(4-hydroxyphenyl)` substituents, one at C2 and one at C4.\n    *   Placing these substituents on the parent chain gives the exact structure derived from the aldol condensation mechanism: `(HO-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=C(HO-C₆H₄)-CHO`.\n*   **Option C**, `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal`, is the aldol addition product formed before dehydration. Since the reaction is heated, it is an intermediate, not the final product.\n*   **Option B** and **Option D** are structurally incorrect based on the reactants and reaction type.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the entire reaction sequence is the aldol condensation product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
