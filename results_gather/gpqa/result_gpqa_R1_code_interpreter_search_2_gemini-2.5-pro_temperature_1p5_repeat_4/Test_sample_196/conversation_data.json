    "*   **Analysis of Compound X**\n\n    1.  **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   The broad absorption in the range of `3400–2500 cm-1` is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong absorption at `1720 cm-1` corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at `1610 cm-1` and `1450 cm-1` are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   Conclusion from IR: The compound contains a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring.\n\n    2.  **1H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   `10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)`: This is a broad singlet integrating to one proton. Its chemical shift is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n        *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: These signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   The remaining signals describe the alkyl substituent: `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`, `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`, `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`, `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`. Let's piece this fragment together:\n            *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). This is an ethyl fragment part: `CH3-CH2-`.\n            *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) from the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the terminal methyl group and the methine proton.\n            *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). It is attached to the aromatic ring (which explains its downfield shift, being benzylic), the methyl group (doublet), and the ethyl group's methylene part.\n            *   Assembling the alkyl group: The structure is `-CH(CH3)(CH2CH3)`, which is a sec-butyl group.\n\n    3.  **Structure of Compound X:**\n        *   Combining all the pieces, Compound X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para (position 4) position.\n        *   The structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n*   **Reaction Analysis**\n\n    1.  **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    2.  **Reaction Type:** Red P / HI is a very strong reducing agent. It is known to reduce various functional groups, including carboxylic acids, to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically, it reduces a carboxyl group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH3). The aromatic ring is stable under these conditions and will not be reduced.\n    3.  **Applying to Compound X:** The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group at position 1 to a methyl group, while the sec-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged.\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Final Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (also known as 4-sec-butyltoluene).\n\n*   **Identifying the Final Product from Options**\n\n    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. This is a different acid and the reaction is a reduction.\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: Correct. This matches the predicted product of the reduction.\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material (Compound X).\n\n<<<C>>>"
