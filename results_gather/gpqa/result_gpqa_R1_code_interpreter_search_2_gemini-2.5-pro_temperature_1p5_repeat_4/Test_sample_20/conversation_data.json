    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Definition:** Tautomerism is a type of constitutional isomerism where isomers, called tautomers, are in dynamic equilibrium and are readily interconvertible. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Condition for Keto-Enol Tautomerism:** A key requirement for a ketone or aldehyde to undergo keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one **alpha-hydrogen**. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to the alpha-carbon, which is the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Analyze Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):**\n        *   Structure: It is a six-membered ring containing two ketone groups at opposite positions (1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n        *   Alpha-Carbons: The carbons adjacent (alpha) to each carbonyl group are the carbons involved in the ring's double bonds.\n        *   Alpha-Hydrogens: These alpha-carbons are bonded to other carbons within the ring and have no hydrogen atoms attached. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   Structure: It is a six-membered saturated ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n        *   Alpha-Carbons: The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. For example, the carbon at position 2 is alpha to both the carbonyl at C1 and the carbonyl at C3.\n        *   Alpha-Hydrogens: These alpha-carbons (C2, C4, C6) are CH₂ groups, meaning each has two hydrogen atoms.\n        *   Since there are multiple alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can readily undergo keto-enol tautomerism. It tautomerizes to form its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that **does not** show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. Therefore, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Definition:** Optical isomerism (a type of stereoisomerism) occurs in molecules that are **chiral**. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Condition for Chirality:** The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter). A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to **four different groups**.\n    *   **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Focus on the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). Let's identify the four groups attached to it:\n            1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n            2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n            3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n            4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        *   These four groups are all different. Therefore, the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center.\n        *   Since the molecule contains a chiral center and lacks a plane of symmetry, it is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers, R and S forms).\n    *   **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   Structure: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, and it is the *trans* isomer, meaning the two -COOCH₃ groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n        *   Chiral Centers: There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The carbons of the double bond are only bonded to three groups each.\n        *   Symmetry: The molecule possesses a center of symmetry (inversion center) and a plane of symmetry.\n        *   Molecules with a plane or center of symmetry are achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It does show *geometric* isomerism with its cis-counterpart, dimethyl maleate).\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that **will show** optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. Therefore, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n3.  **Final Combination:**\n    *   A = benzoquinone\n    *   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n    *   This combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
