    "To determine which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism, we need to assess whether each molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a chiral center or other elements of chirality like axial, planar, or helical chirality, and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule one by one.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. It consists of two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond. The positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 6 on one ring and 2', 6' on the other) are substituted with bulky groups: methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH3) groups at positions 2 and 2', and nitro (-NO2) groups at positions 6 and 6'.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** Due to the steric hindrance caused by these four bulky ortho substituents, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism. The two rings are forced into a non-coplanar (twisted) conformation. In this twisted state, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable. This type of chirality is called axial chirality. Therefore, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the chemical formula CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** We look for a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the hydroxyl group):\n    1.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    2.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism, existing as (R)- and (S)-enantiomers.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2CO. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl groups.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp2-hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl groups), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, a plane of symmetry can pass through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two methoxycarbonyl groups are in a *trans* configuration with respect to the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself), which makes it achiral. Furthermore, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion renders a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (axial chirality).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nThe compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
