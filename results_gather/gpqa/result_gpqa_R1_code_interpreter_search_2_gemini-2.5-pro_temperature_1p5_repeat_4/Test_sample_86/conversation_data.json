    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the given information to deduce the chemical structure.**\n    1.  **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\":** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, with the general formula C6H4R1R2.\n    2.  **\"8 carbon atoms in total\":** The benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents (R1 and R2) must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    3.  **\"Peaks in the FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\":** One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    4.  **\"as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\":** One of the substituents must be a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\n*   **Step 2: Combine the structural features to propose a candidate molecule.**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the two carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and simple group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Therefore, a very strong candidate structure is a halo-acetophenone, with the formula X-C6H4-COCH3. This molecule has a halogen on the ring, a carbonyl group, is di-substituted, and has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 carbon atoms. This structure perfectly fits all the given criteria.\n\n*   **Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the proposed structure and compare it with the given options.**\n    *   The structure is a halo-acetophenone. It can exist as ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) isomers. Let's analyze the expected NMR signals for these.\n    *   **Common signals for all isomers:**\n        *   The methyl protons of the acetyl group (-COCH3) are isolated from other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its chemical shift should be around 2.3-2.6 ppm because it's adjacent to a carbonyl group attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Aromatic signals (4H total):**\n        *   For **ortho** and **meta** isomers, the four aromatic protons are all chemically non-equivalent and would produce a complex pattern of multiple signals (multiplets).\n        *   For the **para (1,4)** isomer, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. The four aromatic protons are present as two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This results in a simpler and very characteristic pattern: **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be further downfield (higher ppm) than the protons ortho to the halogen. The expected chemical shift range for aromatic protons attached to electron-withdrawing groups is typically 7.0-8.0 ppm.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the given NMR data options.**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), ... 3.7 (2H, s)**: The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. A structure that would give these signals and have 8 carbons, such as 4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde, would have the halogen on the methyl group, not the aromatic ring, which contradicts the \"aromatic-halogen bond\" requirement.\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**:\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This perfectly matches the signal for the methyl group of an acetyl substituent.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, in the aromatic region is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriate for a ring with two electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   This data is fully consistent with the structure of **para-haloacetophenone**.\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: The chemical shifts are too low for aromatic protons (which are typically > 6.5 ppm). This does not represent an aromatic compound.\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), ...**: A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 protons on the ring. This spectrum shows only 1 proton in the aromatic region. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a para-haloacetophenone. The NMR data in option B is the only one that correctly describes this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>"
