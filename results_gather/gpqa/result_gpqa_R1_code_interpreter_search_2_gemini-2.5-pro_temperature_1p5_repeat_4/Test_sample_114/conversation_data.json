    "An electron and a positron collide and annihilate, producing two photons. To solve this problem, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\n**1. Initial State: Energy and Momentum**\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy and momentum of the electron and the positron before the collision. The energy-momentum relation for a particle with rest mass *m* and Lorentz factor *γ* is:\n*   Total energy: E = γmc²\n*   Magnitude of momentum *p*: (pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (γ² - 1)(mc²)²\n\nLet mₑ be the rest mass of an electron (and a positron). The rest energy is mₑc² ≈ 0.511 MeV.\n\n*   **Electron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, γₑ = 4\n    *   Energy, Eₑ = γₑmₑc² = 4mₑc²\n    *   Momentum, pₑc = sqrt(γₑ² - 1)mₑc² = sqrt(4² - 1)mₑc² = sqrt(15)mₑc²\n    *   The electron moves from the left, so we'll assign its momentum to the positive x-direction: p⃗ₑ = (sqrt(15)mₑc, 0)\n\n*   **Positron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, γₚ = 2\n    *   Energy, Eₚ = γₚmₑc² = 2mₑc²\n    *   Momentum, pₚc = sqrt(γₚ² - 1)mₑc² = sqrt(2² - 1)mₑc² = sqrt(3)mₑc²\n    *   The positron moves from the right, so its momentum is in the negative x-direction: p⃗ₚ = (-sqrt(3)mₑc, 0)\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total initial energy is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies:\nE_initial = Eₑ + Eₚ = 4mₑc² + 2mₑc² = 6mₑc²\n\nAfter the annihilation, this energy is converted into two photons. The problem states that the photons have equal energy. Let the energy of each photon be Eᵧ.\nE_final = Eᵧ + Eᵧ = 2Eᵧ\n\nBy conservation of energy:\nE_initial = E_final\n6mₑc² = 2Eᵧ\nEᵧ = 3mₑc²\n\n**3. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe total initial momentum is the vector sum of the individual momenta:\np⃗_initial = p⃗ₑ + p⃗ₚ = (sqrt(15)mₑc, 0) + (-sqrt(3)mₑc, 0)\np⃗_initial = ((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))mₑc, 0)\n\nNow consider the final state. The photons have no rest mass, so their momentum *pᵧ* is related to their energy by Eᵧ = pᵧc.\npᵧ = Eᵧ/c = 3mₑc\n\nThe problem states one photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". Since the initial momentum is purely in the x-direction, the y-components of the photon momenta must cancel out. This means they are emitted at equal and opposite angles, +θ and -θ, to the horizontal axis.\n\n*   Momentum of photon 1: p⃗ᵧ₁ = (pᵧ cos(θ), pᵧ sin(θ))\n*   Momentum of photon 2: p⃗ᵧ₂ = (pᵧ cos(θ), -pᵧ sin(θ))\n\nThe total final momentum is:\np⃗_final = p⃗ᵧ₁ + p⃗ᵧ₂ = (2pᵧ cos(θ), 0)\n\nBy conservation of momentum:\np⃗_initial = p⃗_final\n((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))mₑc, 0) = (2pᵧ cos(θ), 0)\n\nComparing the x-components:\n(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))mₑc = 2pᵧ cos(θ)\n\n**4. Calculate the Angle**\n\nSubstitute the value of pᵧ = 3mₑc into the momentum equation:\n(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))mₑc = 2(3mₑc) cos(θ)\n(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))mₑc = 6mₑc cos(θ)\n\nThe term mₑc cancels out. Now, we solve for cos(θ):\ncos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n\nThe angle of each photon with the axis is θ. The angle *between* the two photons is 2θ.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta)\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in degrees\n# theta = arccos(cos_theta)\ntheta_degrees = math.degrees(math.acos(cos_theta))\n\n# The angle between the two photons is 2 * theta\nangle_between_photons = 2 * theta_degrees\n\nprint(angle_between_photons)\n```\n\n<<<138.45933923533475\n\nRounding to the nearest integer, the angle is 138 degrees.\n\n<<<A>>>",
