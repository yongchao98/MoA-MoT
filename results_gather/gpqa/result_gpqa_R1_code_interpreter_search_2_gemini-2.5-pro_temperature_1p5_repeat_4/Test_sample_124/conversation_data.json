    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Governing Equation:**\n    The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system needs to be solved to find the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.\n\n2.  **Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    For a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy eigenvalues are quantized and are given by the formula:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $n$ is the principal quantum number, which can take non-negative integer values ($n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$).\n\n3.  **Identify the Energy Levels:**\n    *   The **ground state** corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which occurs at $n=0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   The **first excited state** corresponds to $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   The **second excited state** corresponds to $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   The **third excited state** corresponds to $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Degeneracy (Number of Linearly Independent Eigenfunctions):**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of distinct quantum states (eigenfunctions) that share the same energy. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy $g_n$ for a given principal quantum number $n$ is given by the formula:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degeneracy for the Third Excited State:**\n    For the third excited state, we have $n=3$. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$\n\n    Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy of the third excited state.\n\n    *Alternative Method for Degeneracy (using Cartesian coordinates):*\n    The quantum number $n$ can be expressed as the sum of quantum numbers for each Cartesian dimension: $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers. We need to find the number of unique combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3.\n    *   (3, 0, 0) and its permutations: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). (3 states)\n    *   (2, 1, 0) and its permutations: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). (6 states)\n    *   (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1). (1 state)\n    Total number of states = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10. This confirms the degeneracy is 10.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated energy for the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    The calculated degeneracy (number of possible linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.\n    Matching this with the given options:\n    A) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 10\n    B) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10$\n    C) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3$\n    D) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3$\n\n    Option B matches our results perfectly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
