    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound with its most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier. The ratio of the M⁺ peak (100%) to the M⁺+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This distinctive isotopic pattern is a strong indicator that the molecule contains **one chlorine atom**. (The natural abundances of chlorine isotopes are approximately 75.8% for ³⁵Cl and 24.2% for ³⁷Cl, giving a ratio of about 3:1).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotopologue) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\nLet's check the molecular weights of the options. All options (A, B, C, D) have the same molecular formula, C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   Molecular Weight (using ³⁵Cl) = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n*   Molecular Weight (using ³⁷Cl) = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158 g/mol.\nAll four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding dimers.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl region and its position is typical for the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid, particularly one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option **A) Phenyl chloroformate** (an acid chloride/ester) and option **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (an aldehyde/phenol). We are left with options B and D.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal, far downfield, is classic for a **carboxylic acid proton**. The integration of 1H confirms this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) & 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring makes the two protons adjacent to one substituent equivalent to each other, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent also equivalent to each other.\n    *   Let's compare this to the remaining options:\n        *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted (1,2-disubstituted) ring. It has four unique aromatic protons, which would result in a much more complex splitting pattern (not two simple doublets).\n        *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) ring. This substitution pattern perfectly explains the two doublets for a total of 4 aromatic protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are deshielded the most and appear at 8.02 ppm, while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom appear at 7.72 ppm.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nCombining all the evidence:\n*   MS indicates a molecular formula of C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   IR indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and indicates a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\nThe only structure that fits all of these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
