    "The user wants to compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term, `⟨H⟩`, with a specific transition energy, `ΔE`, in a Hydrogen atom.\n\n**1. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Term `⟨H⟩`**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic coupling (Zeeman effect) of an electron's orbital angular momentum with an external magnetic field `B` is given by:\n`H_para = - (e / 2m_e) * L · B`\n\nIf the magnetic field `B` is directed along the z-axis, `B = B_z * k̂`, the expression simplifies to:\n`H_para = - (e / 2m_e) * L_z * B_z`\n\nThe expectation value `⟨H⟩` of this term is:\n`⟨H⟩ = - (e / 2m_e) * ⟨L_z⟩ * B_z`\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the angular momentum is `⟨L_z⟩ = mħ`, where `m` is the orbital magnetic quantum number and `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nSubstituting this in, we get:\n`⟨H⟩ = - (eħ / 2m_e) * m * B_z`\n\nThe term `(eħ / 2m_e)` is known as the Bohr magneton, `μ_B`. Therefore:\n`⟨H⟩ = -μ_B * m * B`\n\nWe are given:\n*   `B = 1 T`\n*   `m` is a small integer. Let's use `m = 1` for a representative calculation.\n\nThe value of the Bohr magneton is `μ_B ≈ 9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J/T`.\n\nThe magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy is:\n`|⟨H⟩| = μ_B * |m| * B = (9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J/T) * 1 * 1 T = 9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J`\n\nSo, `⟨H⟩` is on the order of `10⁻²³ J`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Transition Energy `ΔE`**\n\nThe transition energy `ΔE` can be calculated from the given wavelength `λ` of the emitted/absorbed photon using the Planck-Einstein relation:\n`ΔE = h * c / λ`\n\nWhere:\n*   `h` is the Planck constant (`6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s`).\n*   `c` is the speed of light (`3.00 × 10⁸ m/s`).\n*   `λ` is the wavelength (`0.4861 μm = 0.4861 × 10⁻⁶ m`).\n\nLet's calculate `ΔE`:\n`ΔE = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s) / (0.4861 × 10⁻⁶ m)`\n`ΔE ≈ 4.089 × 10⁻¹⁹ J`\n\nThis transition corresponds to the Balmer series (`n=4 → n=2`) in the Hydrogen atom, which is a typical electronic transition energy.\n\n**3. Compare `⟨H⟩` and `ΔE`**\n\nNow, we compare the orders of magnitude of the two energies:\n*   `⟨H⟩ ≈ 9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J`\n*   `ΔE ≈ 4.089 × 10⁻¹⁹ J`\n\nLet's find their ratio:\n`|⟨H⟩| / ΔE = (9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J) / (4.089 × 10⁻¹⁹ J) ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁵`\n\nSince the ratio is extremely small (`~10⁻⁵`), it is clear that the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic transition energy.\n\n`|⟨H⟩| ≪ ΔE`\n\nTherefore, the relationship between the two quantities is that the paramagnetic coupling term is much, much less than the transition energy.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."
