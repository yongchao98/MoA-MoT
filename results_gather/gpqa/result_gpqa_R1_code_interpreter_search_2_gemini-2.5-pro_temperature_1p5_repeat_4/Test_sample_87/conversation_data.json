    "The user is describing an experiment that traces an immune response in the gut. Let's break down the key steps and observations to identify the underlying biological process.\n\n1.  **Antigen Administration:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (the antigen) are delivered orally. This mimics a natural route of infection for rotavirus.\n2.  **Antigen Uptake:** The antigen reaches Peyer's patches, which are key inductive sites for mucosal immunity in the small intestine. This is where immune responses are initiated.\n3.  **Cellular Response:** Proliferating cells are found in the Peyer's patches where the antigen is located. This indicates that lymphocytes (B cells and/or T cells) have recognized the antigen and are undergoing clonal expansion.\n4.  **Genetic Analysis:** The variable heavy chain gene of these proliferating cells is sequenced. This gene segment is a component of the B cell receptor (and the antibody it will secrete).\n5.  **Key Finding:** The sequencing reveals \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene among this population of proliferating cells.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options in the context of this key finding:\n\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system that helps clear pathogens. It is a protein cascade and does not involve altering the genes of lymphocytes.\n*   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow during B cell development, *before* the B cell ever encounters an antigen. The experiment is observing a process happening *after* antigen encounter in a secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch).\n*   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells that are proliferating within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM intentionally introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This generates variants of the original B cell receptor. B cells with mutations that lead to higher affinity for the antigen are then selected to survive and proliferate further (a process called affinity maturation). This directly explains the \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating cell population.\n*   **D) Class switching recombination:** This process also occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers. It changes the constant region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which alters the antibody's function. However, it does not change the variable region, which is responsible for antigen binding. Therefore, it does not account for the variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene.\n\nThe experimental observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells within a Peyer's patch after antigen exposure is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
