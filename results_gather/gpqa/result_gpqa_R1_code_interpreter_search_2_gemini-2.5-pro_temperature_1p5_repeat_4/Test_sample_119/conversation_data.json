    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the key quantities:**\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** This is an angular measurement that is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star. Mathematically, `plx = k/d`, where k is a constant. For simplicity in derivations, we often set `k=1`, so `plx = 1/d`. This means `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Uniform distribution:** This assumption means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's call this constant number density `ρ` (rho).\n\n2.  **Count stars in a volume of space:**\n    *   The number of stars (`N`) within a certain volume (`V`) is given by `N = ρ * V`. Since `ρ` is constant, the number of stars is directly proportional to the volume.\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars within a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from the observer, with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = (Area of sphere) * (thickness) = (4πd²) * dd`.\n\n3.  **Find the number of stars in the shell:**\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) in this thin shell is the number density multiplied by the volume of the shell: `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   This equation tells us how many stars we expect to find in a small distance interval `dd` at a distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Convert from distance (`d`) to parallax (`plx`):**\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We currently have an expression for `dN` in terms of `d` and `dd`. We need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have the relationship `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d = plx⁻¹`\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   Rearranging this gives `dd = -(1/plx²) * d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we count stars, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign: `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Combine the equations:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * d² * dd`\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Simplifying this gives:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the final relationship:**\n    *   To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = ρ * 4π / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `ρ` and `4π` are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
