    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH):\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume\n    *   Moles = 0.05 M × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol\n*   Total volume after adding water:\n    *   Volume_total = 20.00 cm3 (acid) + 20.00 cm3 (water) = 40.00 cm3 = 0.0400 L\n*   Concentration of the diluted acetic acid:\n    *   Concentration_new = Moles / Volume_total\n    *   Concentration_new = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm3 of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COONa). This creates a buffer solution containing both acetic acid (the weak acid, HA) and acetate (the conjugate base, A-).\n\n*   The titration reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO-Na+ + H2O\n*   At this point, 75% of the original acid (CH3COOH) remains, and 25% has been converted to the conjugate base (CH3COO-).\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to calculate the pH of a buffer:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A-] / [HA])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) = 4.73\n*   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The ratio of concentrations [A-]/[HA] is equal to the ratio of their mole fractions, which is 25%/75% or 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(25 / 75) = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - log(3) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by NaOH, and the solution contains only the conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The acetate ion (CH3COO-) hydrolyzes water, which makes the solution basic.\n\n*   The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻\n*   First, we need the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point:\n    *   Moles of NaOH = Moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 mol\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    *   Volume_total = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH3COO⁻]) at the equivalence point:\n    *   [CH3COO⁻] = Moles / Volume_total = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion, which can be found using the acid dissociation constant (Ka) and the ion-product constant for water (Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C):\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) = 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Now, we can find the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis equilibrium. Let [OH⁻] = x.\n    *   Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]\n    *   5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02 M.\n    *   5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) = 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Now, calculate the pOH:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) = 5.48\n*   Finally, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n    *   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH at 25% titration = 4.26 and pH at the equivalence point = 8.52.
