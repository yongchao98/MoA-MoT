    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the substances B, D, and H from Clue 4.**\n\n*   Clue 4 states: `D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   We need two common gases that react to form a common solvent. A very well-known reaction that fits this description is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas.\n*   `CO(g) + Cl₂(g) -> COCl₂(g/l)`\n*   Phosgene (COCl₂) is a liquid at room temperature (boiling point 8 °C) and is used as a solvent in some specific organic chemistry applications.\n*   Therefore, we can tentatively identify:\n    *   **B = CO** (Carbon monoxide)\n    *   **D = Cl₂** (Chlorine)\n    *   **H = COCl₂** (Phosgene)\n\n**Step 2: Identify the extremely hazardous product E from Clue 2.**\n\n*   Clue 2 states: `C + 2 D (gas) -> E (extremely hazardous)`\n*   Substituting D = Cl₂, the reaction is: `C + 2Cl₂ -> E`\n*   Clue 1 (`A + 8B -> C`) suggests that C is a carbonyl compound because B is CO.\n*   The product E is described as \"extremely hazardous\". Phosgene (COCl₂) is famously hazardous, having been used as a chemical weapon in WWI.\n*   It is plausible that the reaction of a metal carbonyl (C) with excess chlorine (D) would produce phosgene (E) along with other products. For example, the chlorine could displace the CO ligands, which then react with more chlorine to form phosgene.\n*   Given that E and H are formed from the same reactants (B and D, or compounds containing them) and H is identified as phosgene, it's highly probable that the \"extremely hazardous product E\" is also **phosgene (COCl₂)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the remaining clues for consistency.**\n\n*   Clue 3 states: `C + Water -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`\n*   If C is a carbonyl compound, the hydrolysis of the CO ligands would produce carbonic acid (`H₂CO₃`), which is a weak acid. This is a perfect candidate for **G**.\n*   This means C must also contain a component that hydrolyzes to form a strong acid, **F**. The source of this component must be the solid reactant **A**. The puzzle here is that A is also reformed. While resolving this completely is complex (and may point to a specific but less common reactant like `Fe(CO)₄I₂` where `A=FeI₂`, `F=HI`, despite a stoichiometry mismatch), the identification of `E=COCl₂` remains the most robust conclusion based on the clearest clues.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n\n*   We have identified **E = COCl₂ (phosgene)**.\n*   To find its molecular symmetry group, we need to analyze its 3D structure.\n*   The phosgene molecule has a central carbon atom double-bonded to one oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. Due to VSEPR theory, the molecule is trigonal planar.\n\n    ```\n       O\n      //\n     C\n    / \\\n   Cl Cl\n    ```\n\n*   Now, let's identify the symmetry elements:\n    1.  **Identity (E)**: Every molecule has this.\n    2.  **A two-fold rotation axis (C₂)**: This axis passes through the C=O bond, bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle. Rotating by 180° leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    3.  **Two vertical mirror planes (σᵥ)**:\n        *   One plane contains all four atoms (the plane of the molecule).\n        *   The second plane is perpendicular to the first one. It contains the C₂ axis (the C=O bond) and bisects the Cl-C-Cl bond angle.\n*   A molecule that possesses the symmetry elements E, C₂, and two perpendicular σᵥ planes belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\n*   Let's check the options provided:\n    *   A) C2v: Matches our finding.\n    *   B) C2: Lacks the mirror planes of phosgene.\n    *   C) D∞h: For linear, centrosymmetric molecules (e.g., CO₂). Phosgene is not linear.\n    *   D) D4h: For square planar molecules (e.g., XeF₄). Phosgene is trigonal planar.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is C2v.\n\n<<<A>>>"
