    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, we need to translate the textual description of the molecule into a chemical structure.\n\n*   **Core:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Main Functional Group:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH). By IUPAC priority, this will be the principal functional group, so we assign its carbon as C1. The parent name will be **benzoic acid**.\n*   **Substituent Positions relative to -COOH (C1):**\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, or 'formyl' as a substituent) and cyano (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid. Meta positions are C3 and C5. The description also says these three groups are meta to one another, which fits the C1, C3, C5 arrangement.\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are ortho to the carboxylic acid. Ortho positions are C2 and C6.\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid. The para position is C4.\n\n*   **Cross-Referencing Positions:**\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   Let's initially assume the cyano group (-CN) is at C3 and the formyl group (-CHO) is at C5. The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. The description says the methoxy (-OCH3 at C4) and the alcohol (-OH) are here. This means the -OH group must be at C2.\n    *   This arrangement places the substituents as follows:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxyl/alcohol)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano/nitrile)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C6: The remaining ortho position must be the dimethylamino group, -N(CH3)2.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the initial description.\n*   -COOH, -CHO, -CN are at C1, C5, C3. All are meta to each other. (Correct)\n*   -OH (C2) and -N(CH3)2 (C6) are ortho to -COOH (C1). (Correct)\n*   -OCH3 (C4) is para to -COOH (C1). (Correct)\n*   -OCH3 (C4) and -OH (C2) are ortho to -CN (C3). (Correct)\nThe structure is unambiguously determined.\n\n### 2. Determine IUPAC Numbering\n\nThe carbon with the principal functional group (-COOH) is C1. We must number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n\n*   **Clockwise Numbering:** C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH3), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH3)2). The locants are **{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}**.\n*   **Counter-Clockwise Numbering:** C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH3)2), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH3), C5(-CN), C6(-OH). The locants are **{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}**.\n\nSince both numbering schemes produce the same set of locants, we must use a tie-breaker rule. The rule states that we give the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n### 3. Alphabetize the Substituents\n\nThe substituents are:\n*   -CN: **cyano**\n*   -N(CH3)2: **dimethylamino**\n*   -CHO: **formyl**\n*   -OH: **hydroxy**\n*   -OCH3: **methoxy**\n\nAccording to current IUPAC rules (2013 Blue Book), multiplying prefixes like 'di-', 'tri-', etc., are included when alphabetizing. Therefore, 'dimethylamino' is alphabetized under 'd'.\n\nThe alphabetical order is:\n1.  **c**yano\n2.  **d**imethylamino\n3.  **f**ormyl\n4.  **h**ydroxy\n5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n### 4. Apply the Tie-Breaker and Finalize Numbering\n\nThe substituent that comes first alphabetically is **cyano**. We must choose the numbering direction that gives the cyano group the lower number.\n\n*   In the clockwise direction, the cyano group is at **C3**.\n*   In the counter-clockwise direction, the cyano group is at **C5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the **clockwise numbering scheme is correct**.\nThe final, correct assignment of locants is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -OH (2-hydroxy)\n*   C3: -CN (3-cyano)\n*   C4: -OCH3 (4-methoxy)\n*   C5: -CHO (5-formyl)\n*   C6: -N(CH3)2 (6-dimethylamino)\n\n### 5. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\nThe name is constructed by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n1.  **3-cyano**\n2.  **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses used for clarity with complex substituents)\n3.  **5-formyl**\n4.  **2-hydroxy**\n5.  **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these parts gives the full name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 6. Compare with Options\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n*   B) **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** (Matches our derived name)\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering and alphabetical order)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
