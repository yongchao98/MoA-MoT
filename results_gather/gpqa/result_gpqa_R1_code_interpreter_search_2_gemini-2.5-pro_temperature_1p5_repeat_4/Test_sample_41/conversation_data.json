    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics of Equilibrium Temperature:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. The formula is:\n    T_eq = [L * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * a²)]^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   L = Star's luminosity\n    *   A = Planet's albedo\n    *   σ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n    *   a = Orbital distance (semi-major axis)\n\n    Since all three planets orbit the same star, L is constant. The problem states that the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets. The term 16πσ is a constant. Therefore, we can establish a proportionality:\n    T_eq ∝ (1/a²)^(1/4)\n    T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)\n\n    This means that the square of the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the orbital distance:\n    T_eq² ∝ 1/a, or a ∝ 1/T_eq²\n\n2.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its orbital distance (a). For planets orbiting the same star, the law simplifies to:\n    P² ∝ a³\n\n    The mass information (M1/M2, M2/M3) and the mention of the TTV method could suggest using the more complete form of Kepler's Law, which includes the planet's mass. However, without the star's mass, this path is not solvable. In most cases, the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass (M_planet << M_star), so the simplified version is used. The extra information about mass and albedo value is likely extraneous to distract from the core relationships.\n\n3.  **Combine the Relationships to Relate Period and Temperature:**\n    Now we combine the two proportionalities to find a direct relationship between the orbital period (P) and the equilibrium temperature (T_eq).\n\n    From Step 1: a ∝ T_eq⁻²\n    From Step 2: P² ∝ a³\n\n    Substitute the expression for 'a' from the first relationship into the second one:\n    P² ∝ (T_eq⁻²)³\n    P² ∝ T_eq⁻⁶\n\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives the relationship between period and temperature:\n    P ∝ T_eq⁻³\n\n    This means the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Ratios:**\n    We need to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, which is the ratio P3 / P1.\n    Using the proportionality from Step 3:\n    P3 / P1 = (T_eq3 / T_eq1)⁻³ = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³\n\n    We are given the temperature ratios:\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4\n    *   T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3\n\n    We can find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3 by multiplying these two given ratios:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Answer:**\n    Now, substitute the value of (T_eq1 / T_eq3) back into the period ratio equation:\n    P3 / P1 = (3.22)³\n\n    Let's perform the calculation.\n```python\nprint((1.4 * 2.3)**3)\n```\n<execute_result>\n33.386248\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 33.39. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 10.4\nB) ~ 4.4\nC) ~ 33.4\nD) ~ 3.2\n\nThe calculated value of ~33.4 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
