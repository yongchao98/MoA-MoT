    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\nZ is a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. Let's use the approximate atomic masses C ≈ 12 amu and H ≈ 1 amu.\nMass fraction of H = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1) = 0.1428\ny = 0.1428 * (12x + y)\ny = 1.7136x + 0.1428y\n0.8572y = 1.7136x\ny/x ≈ 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.00\nSo, the empirical formula of Z is CH₂. The general formula is (CH₂)ₙ or CₙH₂ₙ.\nThis general formula corresponds to alkenes or cycloalkanes.\nThe problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a fully saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D, and it does not decolorize bromine water. This implies that C and D are saturated or aromatic compounds.\nWe are told that Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane (CₙH₂ₙ).\nMixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X (which contains unsaturated compounds) when heated with a platinum catalyst. This type of reaction, particularly over Pt, involves hydrogen transfer. Some molecules are hydrogenated (reduced) and others are dehydrogenated (oxidized).\nSince Z (CₙH₂ₙ) is the hydrogenated product, the other product D must be the dehydrogenated product. Dehydrogenation of a cycloalkene or cycloalkadiene typically leads to a stable aromatic compound (an arene).\nThe simplest and most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane (n=6). Let's hypothesize that **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\nIf Z is cyclohexane, the dehydrogenation product D would be **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\nLet's check if this hypothesis for Y fits the description:\n*   Mixture Y = equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   Does it decolorize bromine water? No. Cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene only reacts with bromine in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, not with bromine water. This fits.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y. This fits.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a widely used solvent. This is correct.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X.**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. It decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components are unsaturated. The molecules of X do not contain conjugated multiple bonds.\nThe reaction is the disproportionation of X to form Y:\nA + B → C + D\nSubstituting the identities of C and D we found:\nA + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)\nThis is a hydrogen transfer reaction. For the atoms to be balanced, the sum of the atoms in A and B must equal the sum of the atoms in C and D.\nTotal atoms on the right side: (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\nSo, the reactants A + B must also have the total formula C₁₂H₁₈.\nWe also know that hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both A and B must have a six-carbon ring skeleton. So, their formulas must be C₆Hₓ and C₆Hᵧ.\nFrom the atom balance, we have x + y = 18.\nWe need to find two different unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆-ring compounds (A and B) whose hydrogen counts sum to 18.\nLet's consider possible candidates:\n*   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: It has one double bond, so it's unsaturated. It is not conjugated. Its carbon skeleton is a C₆ ring. It's a liquid at room temperature.\n*   **Cyclohexadienes (C₆H₈)**:\n    *   Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated, so it's ruled out by the problem statement.\n    *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene** is not conjugated. It is unsaturated. Its carbon skeleton is a C₆ ring. It's a liquid at room temperature.\nLet's see if we can use these two as A and B.\nLet A = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈).\nLet's check the total hydrogen atoms: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches the requirement.\nSo, a plausible identity for mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n\n**Step 4: Final verification of the entire scheme.**\n*   **Mixture X**: Equimolar cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈). Both are liquids, unsaturated, and non-conjugated. This is consistent.\n*   **Reaction**: `C₆H₁₀ (A) + C₆H₈ (B) --(Pt, heat)--> C₆H₁₂ (C) + C₆H₆ (D)`. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer (disproportionation). Cyclohexa-1,4-diene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the hydrogen is transferred to cyclohexene to form cyclohexane.\n*   **Mixture Y**: Equimolar cyclohexane and benzene. Neither decolorizes bromine water. This is consistent.\n*   **Hydrogenation of X**: `C₆H₁₀ + H₂ → C₆H₁₂`; `C₆H₈ + 2H₂ → C₆H₁₂`. Both give only cyclohexane (Z). Consistent.\n*   **Hydrogenation of Y**: `C₆H₁₂ → C₆H₁₂`; `C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂`. Both give only cyclohexane (Z). Consistent.\nAll conditions of the problem are satisfied by this model.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of compound A and one molecule of compound B.\n*   Compound A: Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Compound B: Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
