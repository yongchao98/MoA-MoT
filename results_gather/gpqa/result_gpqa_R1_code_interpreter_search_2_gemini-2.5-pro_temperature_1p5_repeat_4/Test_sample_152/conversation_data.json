    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a base (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The p-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   The attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. This generates a new enolate intermediate: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH⁻-COOCH₃`.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The final product structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n\n4.  **Name Product A and Compare with Options:**\n    *   Let's analyze the names provided in the options, which use a \"propane-tricarboxylate\" system. This naming system considers a three-carbon chain as the backbone.\n    *   Our product's backbone can be seen as `(malonate C) - (acrylate β-C) - (acrylate α-C)`.\n    *   Let's draw the structure corresponding to the name in option B/C: `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n        *   Propane backbone: C1-C2-C3\n        *   Substituents: a p-tolyl group at C2, two methoxycarbonyl (-COOMe) groups at C1, and one -COOMe group at C3.\n        *   This corresponds to the structure `(MeOOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂-COOMe`.\n    *   Let's rearrange our derived product `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃` to `(MeOOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂-COOMe`.\n    *   The structures match. Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, which serves as a nucleophile at the β-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This is part of a Stork enamine synthesis.\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), which has the structure `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium salt intermediate. The substituent `(-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN)` is added to the cyclohexanone ring at the α-position to the carbonyl (which is temporarily an iminium ion).\n    *   The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) has two functions: protonating the intermediate nitrile enolate and hydrolyzing the iminium salt back to a ketone.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The piperidine group is removed, and a carbonyl group (C=O) is reformed at C1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   A `3-cyanopropyl` group is attached at C2. Specifically, the group is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n    *   The product name with the nitrile as the principal functional group is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. This is the more stable keto-form, which is expected as the major product after acidic workup.\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. This matches the keto form in options B and C. The enol form in options A and D (`3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`) is less likely to be the major final product.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   We are given the product and need to find the Michael donor (reactant C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   The reaction is a Michael addition. The product consists of two parts: a piece from the donor and a piece from the acceptor.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Product:**\n    *   The acceptor, MVK (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`), after reaction, becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` group (the `3-oxobutyl` group).\n    *   This group is attached to C2 of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring system.\n    *   Therefore, the Michael donor (reactant C) must be the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` molecule.\n\n3.  **Verify the Forward Reaction:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic proton at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   The resulting enolate attacks the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Protonation yields the given product. The mechanism is consistent.\n\n4.  **Identify Reactant C and Compare with Options:**\n    *   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The options list either `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` (options B and D) or `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione` (options A and C). The latter is an enol tautomer. The starting material is the dione itself.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   **B** is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   **C** is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nThis combination of reactants and products matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
