    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the *coupled basis* as $|\\psi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    *   We want to find the probability of obtaining the eigenvalues $-\\hbar$ for both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. This specific measurement outcome corresponds to the system collapsing into a state in the *uncoupled basis*.\n    *   The state corresponding to the eigenvalues $L_{1z} \\to m_{l1}\\hbar = -1\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} \\to m_{l2}\\hbar = -1\\hbar$ is the uncoupled state $|\\phi\\rangle = |l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply Born's Rule:**\n    *   According to the postulates of quantum mechanics (Born's rule), the probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|\\psi\\rangle$, to be in the state $|\\phi\\rangle$ is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the two states:\n        $P = |\\langle\\phi|\\psi\\rangle|^2 = |\\langle1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle|^2$.\n\n3.  **Use Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\n    *   The inner product $\\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle$ (with $l_1, l_2$ implied) is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. These coefficients relate the coupled and uncoupled bases.\n    *   The transformation from the coupled basis to the uncoupled basis is given by:\n        $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} \\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle |l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$\n    *   The term we are interested in, $\\langle1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, is the amplitude (or coefficient) of the state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$ in the expansion of $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Selection Rule for Angular Momentum:**\n    *   A fundamental property of the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. The total z-component angular momentum operator is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   In the coupled basis, the state $|l, m\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar$. So, for our initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, the total z-component quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   In the uncoupled basis, the state $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, with eigenvalue $(m_{l1} + m_{l2})\\hbar$.\n    *   For the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle$ to be non-zero, the z-components must be conserved, which leads to the selection rule:\n        $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m$\n\n5.  **Check the Selection Rule for the Specific Case:**\n    *   For the desired outcome state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, we have $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   The sum is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   For the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   Comparing the two, we see that $-2 \\neq -1$. The selection rule $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m$ is not satisfied.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    *   Because the selection rule is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n        $\\langle1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is:\n        $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThis means it is impossible to find the system in a state where $L_{1z}=-\\hbar$ and $L_{2z}=-\\hbar$ if it started in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The measurement of the individual z-components must always yield values that sum to the total z-component quantum number of the initial state, which is -1.\n\nTo confirm this, we can use a Python script with the `sympy` library to compute the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\nfrom sympy import S\n\n# The problem asks for the probability of measuring m1=-1 and m2=-1,\n# given the initial state |l=2, m=-1>.\n# This probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product\n# <l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>, which is a Clebsch-Gordan (CG) coefficient.\n\n# Parameters for the CG coefficient CG(l1, m1, l2, m2, l, m):\nl1 = 1\nm1 = -1\nl2 = 1\nm2 = -1\nl = 2\nm = -1\n\n# Calculate the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n# S() converts numbers to SymPy's specific numeric type.\ncg_coefficient = CG(S(l1), S(m1), S(l2), S(m2), S(l), S(m)).doit()\n\n# The probability is the square of the coefficient's value.\n# CG coefficients are real, so we just square it.\nprobability = cg_coefficient**2\n\nprint(f\"The state we are projecting onto is |l1={l1}, m1={m1}; l2={l2}, m2={m2}>.\")\nprint(f\"The initial state is |l={l}, m={m}> (with l1={l1}, l2={l2}).\")\nprint(f\"The selection rule requires m1 + m2 = m.\")\nprint(f\"In our case, {m1} + {m2} = {m1 + m2}, which is not equal to m = {m}.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient should be zero.\")\nprint(f\"Calculated CG coefficient: {cg_coefficient}\")\nprint(f\"Joint Probability: {probability}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe state we are projecting onto is |l1=1, m1=-1; l2=1, m2=-1>.\nThe initial state is |l=2, m=-1> (with l1=1, l2=1).\nThe selection rule requires m1 + m2 = m.\nIn our case, -1 + -1 = -2, which is not equal to m = -1.\nTherefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient should be zero.\nCalculated CG coefficient: 0\nJoint Probability: 0\n<<<B>>>",
    "The final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n### **Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final Quantum States:**\n    *   The initial state of the 2-electron system is given in the *coupled basis* representation:\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n        Here, $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons. The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the total z-component (magnetic) quantum number is $m=-1$.\n\n    *   A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. We are interested in the specific outcome where the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$.\n\n    *   The state corresponding to this measurement outcome is described in the *uncoupled basis* representation:\n        $|\\phi\\rangle = |l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$.\n        The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m_l \\hbar$. Therefore, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to a magnetic quantum number $m_l = -1$. The final state we are projecting onto is:\n        $|\\phi\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    *   According to the principles of quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a system initially in state $|\\psi\\rangle$ to be in the state $|\\phi\\rangle$ is the square of the magnitude of their inner product:\n        $P = |\\langle\\phi|\\psi\\rangle|^2 = |\\langle1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle|^2$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Selection Rule for Angular Momentum Addition:**\n    *   The inner product $\\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle$ is a **Clebsch-Gordan coefficient**. These coefficients are non-zero only if certain selection rules are met.\n    *   The most fundamental rule is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The total z-component operator is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   The eigenvalues must match: $m\\hbar = (m_{l1} + m_{l2})\\hbar$. This gives the selection rule:\n        $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n4.  **Check the Selection Rule for this Specific Case:**\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we have the total z-component quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   From the final state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, we have the individual z-component quantum numbers $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   Let's check if the sum equals $m$:\n        $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We compare the required total z-component ($m=-1$) with the sum of the individual components of the measurement outcome ($m_{l1} + m_{l2}=-2$).\n    *   Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the selection rule is violated.\n    *   This means the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero: $\\langle1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the joint probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nIt is physically impossible for a system with a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$ to be measured and found to have individual components that sum to $-2\\hbar$, as this would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
