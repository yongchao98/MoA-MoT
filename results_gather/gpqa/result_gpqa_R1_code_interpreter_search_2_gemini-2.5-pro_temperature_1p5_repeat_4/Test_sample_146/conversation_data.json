    "This problem involves the annihilation of a proton and an antiproton, and it can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State:**\n    *   The reaction begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. We can approximate it as being at rest.\n    *   We assume the proton is the stationary target, so it is also at rest.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is approximately zero ($P_{initial} \\approx 0$).\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The mass of a proton is equal to the mass of an antiproton ($m_p = m_{\\bar{p}}$).\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2m_p c^2$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Final State:**\n    *   The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   The problem states the rest energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV. We assume $A^+$ and $A^-$ have the same mass, $m_A$.\n    *   By the principle of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero ($P_{final} = P_{initial} \\approx 0$).\n    *   To conserve zero momentum, the four resulting particles must move away from the annihilation point. Due to the symmetry of the problem, it's reasonable to assume that each of the four final particles will have the same magnitude of velocity, $v$, and therefore the same kinetic energy.\n    *   The total energy of a single final particle A is its relativistic energy, $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four particles: $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4\\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total energy before the reaction must equal the total energy after the reaction: $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n    *   $2m_p c^2 = 4\\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Velocity:**\n    *   First, we need the rest energy of a proton, $m_p c^2$. This is a standard physical constant, approximately 938.27 MeV.\n    *   We can rearrange the energy conservation equation to solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{2m_p c^2}{4m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2m_A c^2}$.\n    *   Substitute the known values:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.564$.\n    *   Now, we relate the Lorentz factor to the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.564)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.446}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4088} = \\sqrt{0.5912} \\approx 0.769$.\n    *   So, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nTo get a more precise calculation, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nproton_rest_energy = 938.27208816  # in MeV\nm_A_rest_energy = 300.0           # in MeV\n\n# Conservation of Energy: E_initial = E_final\n# 2 * proton_rest_energy = 4 * gamma * m_A_rest_energy\n\n# Solve for the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = (2 * proton_rest_energy) / (4 * m_A_rest_energy)\n\n# Solve for beta (v/c) from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) => beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / (gamma**2))\n\nprint(f\"The calculated value of gamma is: {gamma}\")\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is: {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\nThe calculated velocity matches one of the options.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem requires applying the principle of conservation of energy to a particle-antiparticle annihilation process.\n\n### **1. Initial State Analysis**\n\n*   The system initially consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which means its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest before the annihilation.\n*   Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton. The mass of a proton is the same as the mass of an antiproton.\n    *   Rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) â‰ˆ 938.27 MeV.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n### **2. Final State Analysis**\n\n*   The annihilation results in four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. We assume they all have the same mass $m_A$.\n*   The rest energy of particle A ($m_A c^2$) is given as 300 MeV.\n*   By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. To achieve this, the four particles must move away from the point of annihilation.\n*   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the total relativistic energies of the four resulting particles. Each particle has a kinetic energy in addition to its rest energy. The total energy of a single particle A is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4\\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n### **3. Applying Conservation of Energy**\n\nEnergy must be conserved, so $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n\n$2m_p c^2 = 4\\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can solve this equation for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2m_p c^2}{4m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2m_A c^2}$\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.564$\n\n### **4. Calculating the Velocity**\n\nNow we can find the velocity ($v$) from the Lorentz factor. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n\nRearranging to solve for $\\beta$:\n\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.564)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.446}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4088} = \\sqrt{0.5912} \\approx 0.7689$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v = 0.7689c$, which is approximately $0.77c$. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
