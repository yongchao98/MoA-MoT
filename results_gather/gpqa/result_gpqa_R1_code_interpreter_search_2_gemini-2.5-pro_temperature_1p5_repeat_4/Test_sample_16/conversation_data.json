    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical equilibrium:** The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex in an aqueous solution. The complex, denoted as [Ca-EDTA]^2-, dissociates into calcium ions (Ca^2+) and the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand (EDTA^4- or Y^4-). The chemical equation for this equilibrium is:\n    [Ca-EDTA]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n\n2.  **Relate formation and dissociation constants:** The problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) for the complex, which is the equilibrium constant for the forward reaction (Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- <=> [Ca-EDTA]^2-).\n    K_f = 5 x 10^10\n\n    We need the equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (K_d). The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f\n    K_d = 1 / (5 x 10^10)\n    K_d = 0.2 x 10^-10 = 2 x 10^-11\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We can use an ICE table to determine the equilibrium concentrations of the species. Let 'x' represent the concentration of Ca^2+ that forms at equilibrium. Since the stoichiometry is 1:1:1, the concentration of EDTA^4- will also be 'x', and the concentration of the [Ca-EDTA]^2- complex will decrease by 'x'.\n\n    | Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n    |-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n    | [Ca-EDTA]^2-    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n    | Ca^2+           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n    | EDTA^4-         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression:** The expression for the dissociation constant K_d is:\n    K_d = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] / [[Ca-EDTA]^2-]\n\n5.  **Substitute and solve for x:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the expression:\n    2 x 10^-11 = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10^-11 = x^2 / (0.02 - x)\n\n6.  **Apply a simplifying approximation:** The value of K_d (2 x 10^-11) is very small. This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the [Ca-EDTA]^2- complex will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. This simplifies the equation significantly.\n\n    2 x 10^-11 ≈ x^2 / 0.02\n\n7.  **Calculate the value of x:** Now, we can solve for x.\n    x^2 ≈ (2 x 10^-11) * 0.02\n    x^2 ≈ 4 x 10^-13\n    x ≈ sqrt(4 x 10^-13)\n\n    To calculate the square root:\n    x ≈ sqrt(40 x 10^-14)\n    x ≈ sqrt(40) x 10^-7\n    Since sqrt(36) = 6 and sqrt(49) = 7, sqrt(40) is approximately 6.3.\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M\n\n8.  **Check the approximation:** The calculated value x ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M is indeed much, much smaller than 0.02 M, so the approximation made in step 6 was valid.\n\n9.  **Final Answer:** The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca^2+], is equal to x.\n    [Ca^2+] ≈ 6.3 x 10^-7 M\n\n    This value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
