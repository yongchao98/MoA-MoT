    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzenes. The goal is to arrange these substances in order of the increasing weight fraction (yield) of the *para*-isomer.\n\n**C6H5-X + Br2 (excess) --(catalyst)--> p-Br-C6H4-X**\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer depends on two main factors:\n*   The directing nature of the substituent X (ortho,para-directing vs. meta-directing).\n*   The ratio of para to ortho substitution for the ortho,para-directors.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents (X) based on their directing effects.\n\n*   **Substances:**\n    1)  ะก6H5-CH3 (Toluene): -CH3 is an activating, ortho,para-directing group.\n    2)  C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): -COOC2H5 is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n    3)  C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene): -Cl is a deactivating, ortho,para-directing group.\n    4)  C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene): -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n    5)  C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): -C2H5 is an activating, ortho,para-directing group.\n    6)  C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid): -COOH is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directors**\n    *   These groups direct the incoming electrophile predominantly to the meta position. The formation of the para-isomer is very low (typically <5%).\n    *   Substances: 4 (-NO2), 6 (-COOH), 2 (-COOC2H5)\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho,para-directors**\n    *   These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   Substances: 1 (-CH3), 5 (-C2H5), 3 (-Cl)\n\nSince meta-directors produce very little para-isomer, they will come first in the ranking (lowest yield). The ortho,para-directors will come last (highest yield).\n\n**3. Rank the Meta-Directors (Substances 4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of ortho and para products.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\n    *   -NO2 is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   -COOH is a strong deactivating group.\n    *   -COOC2H5 is also strongly deactivating, but the electron-donating effect of the -OC2H5 part makes it slightly less deactivating than -COOH.\n\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength:\n    **C6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)**\n    *   Typical para yields: Nitrobenzene (~0.3%), Benzoic acid (~2%), Ethyl benzoate (~3%).\n\n**4. Rank the Ortho,Para-Directors (Substances 1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor ortho,para-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the para/ortho ratio. This ratio is primarily influenced by:\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions, making the para position more accessible. This increases the para/ortho ratio.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** Inductive effects are distance-dependent and can disfavor the ortho position more than the para position.\n\nLet's analyze the substituents:\n\n*   **1) -CH3 (in Toluene):** This is the smallest group among the three. It provides the least steric hindrance. Para yield is high, but there's also significant ortho product (e.g., ~67% para).\n*   **5) -C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. It creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, leading to a higher para/ortho ratio and thus a higher para yield than toluene.\n*   **3) -Cl (in Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group has two competing effects that favor para-substitution.\n    1.  **Steric:** It is bulkier than a hydrogen atom.\n    2.  **Electronic:** It has a strong negative inductive effect (-I), which deactivates the ring. This effect is strongest at the ortho position, making it less favorable for attack than the para position. This electronic factor strongly increases the para/ortho ratio.\n\n*   **Comparing them:**\n    *   **1 vs 5:** -C2H5 is bulkier than -CH3, so para yield is higher for ethylbenzene than for toluene. **Order: 1 < 5**.\n    *   **Comparing with 3:** The combination of steric and (more importantly) electronic effects in chlorobenzene makes it extremely selective for the para position (e.g., ~87% para). The question becomes whether the steric effect of the ethyl group (-C2H5) is more or less significant than the combined effects for the chloro group (-Cl). While the ethyl group is bulkier, the electronic disfavoring of the ortho position in chlorobenzene is a very powerful effect. In many standard comparisons, chlorobenzene is shown to have a very high para yield, often higher than that of ethylbenzene. Thus, it's reasonable to conclude the para yield for chlorobenzene is the highest among these three.\n\n*   This gives the order of increasing para yield for this group as:\n    **C6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5) < C6H5-Cl (3)**\n\n**5. Combine the Rankings**\n\nNow, we combine the rankings for the two groups:\n\n*   Meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho,para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final overall order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
