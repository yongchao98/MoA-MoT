    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Principle of Dimensional Analysis in Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**\n\nIn natural units, where the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ and the speed of light $c$ are set to 1 ($\\hbar = c = 1$), the action $S$ is a dimensionless quantity. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ over four-dimensional spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$\n\nThe mass dimension of the spacetime differential element $d^4x$ is $[d^4x]_M = [(\\text{length})^4]_M$. Since length is the inverse of mass in natural units ($[L] = M^{-1}$), we have $[d^4x]_M = (M^{-1})^4 = M^{-4}$.\n\nFor the action $S$ to be dimensionless ($[S]_M = M^0$), the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of 4:\n$[\\mathcal{L}]_M = M^4$\n\nEvery term in the Lagrangian density must have this same mass dimension.\n\n**2. Mass Dimension of the Fields**\n\nWe can determine the mass dimensions of the fields by looking at their standard kinetic terms.\n\n*   **Fermion field ($\\psi$)**: The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{fermion, kin} = \\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^{\\mu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\psi$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^{\\mu}$ are dimensionless constant matrices, so $[\\gamma^{\\mu}]_M = M^0$.\n    *   The partial derivative $\\partial_{\\mu} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{\\mu}}$ has a mass dimension of 1, so $[\\partial_{\\mu}]_M = M^1$.\n    *   The dimension of this term must be $M^4$: $[\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^{\\mu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\psi]_M = [\\bar{\\psi}]_M [\\psi]_M [\\partial_{\\mu}]_M = M^4$.\n    *   Since $\\bar{\\psi} = \\psi^{\\dagger}\\gamma^0$, it has the same mass dimension as $\\psi$, so $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M = [\\psi]_M$.\n    *   Therefore, $[\\psi]_M^2 \\cdot M^1 = M^4$, which leads to $[\\psi]_M^2 = M^3$.\n    *   So, the mass dimension of the fermion field is $[\\psi]_M = M^{3/2}$.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$)**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{EM, kin} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   The dimension of this term must be $M^4$: $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^4$.\n    *   This implies $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M^2 = M^4$.\n    *   So, the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^2$.\n\n*   **Tensor ($\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$)**: This tensor is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]$.\n    *   Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_{\\mu}$ and the constant $\\frac{i}{2}$ are dimensionless, the tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless.\n    *   So, $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^0$.\n\n**3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we analyze the given interaction Lagrangian term:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$\n\nThe mass dimension of this term must also be 4:\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = M^4$\n\nLet's write this in terms of the dimensions of its components:\n$[\\kappa]_M [\\bar{\\psi}]_M [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M [\\psi]_M [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^4$\n\nSubstitute the dimensions we found in the previous step:\n$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^0) \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^2) = M^4$\n$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot M^{3/2 + 3/2 + 2} = M^4$\n$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot M^{3+2} = M^4$\n$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot M^5 = M^4$\n\nSolving for the mass dimension of $\\kappa$:\n$[\\kappa]_M = \\frac{M^4}{M^5} = M^{-1}$\n\n**4. Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. A simple rule of thumb (power counting renormalizability) is:\n\n*   If the coupling constant $g$ has a **positive mass dimension** ($[g]_M > 0$), the theory is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If the coupling constant $g$ is **dimensionless** ($[g]_M = 0$), the theory is **renormalizable**.\n*   If the coupling constant $g$ has a **negative mass dimension** ($[g]_M < 0$), the theory is **not renormalizable**.\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant is $\\kappa$, and its mass dimension is $[\\kappa]_M = -1$. Since the mass dimension is negative, the interaction term $\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$ leads to a non-renormalizable theory. Such terms are common in effective field theories, where they represent low-energy effects of some more fundamental, renormalizable theory at a higher energy scale $\\Lambda$ (with $\\kappa \\sim 1/\\Lambda$).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n*   The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
