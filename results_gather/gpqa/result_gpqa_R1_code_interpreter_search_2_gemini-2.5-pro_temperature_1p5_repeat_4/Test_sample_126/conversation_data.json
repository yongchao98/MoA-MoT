    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 5-butylnona-2,6-diene.\n    *   **\"nona\"**: A 9-carbon main chain.\n    *   **\"2,6-diene\"**: Two double bonds, starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n    *   **\"5-butyl\"**: A butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5.\n    *   Let's draw the structure. Numbering from left to right gives the lowest locants for the double bonds.\n        CH₃(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(5)(Butyl)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₃(9)\n        The butyl group is -C₄H₉.\n    *   **Reaction Condition:** \"is heated\". Heating an organic molecule, especially one with multiple π-bonds, strongly suggests a pericyclic reaction.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Pericyclic Reactions:**\n    *   **Diels-Alder:** Requires a diene and a dienophile. An intramolecular Diels-Alder is possible but doesn't fit the structure well.\n    *   **Electrocyclization:** Requires a conjugated triene (or more) to form a ring. Our molecule is a non-conjugated diene.\n    *   **Ene Reaction:** Requires an allylic hydrogen and a double bond arranged to form a 6-membered transition state. While there are allylic hydrogens (at C1, C4, C5, C8), forming a favorable intramolecular transition state is not obvious and often leads to cyclic products, which aren't among the options.\n    *   **Sigmatropic Rearrangement:** Our molecule, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene, contains a hexa-1,5-diene subunit (from C2 to C7). This is the perfect substrate for a **Cope rearrangement**, which is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. This is the most likely reaction pathway.\n\n3.  **Apply the Cope Rearrangement Mechanism:**\n    *   A Cope rearrangement transforms one 1,5-diene into an isomeric 1,5-diene. The reaction is reversible and proceeds through a chair-like six-membered transition state.\n    *   The core system undergoing rearrangement consists of the six carbons from C2 to C7:\n        `C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7`\n    *   In a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, the sigma bond between atoms 3 and 4 of the system is broken, and a new sigma bond between atoms 1 and 6 is formed. The double bonds shift.\n    *   Let's number the system according to the standard Cope mechanism: `C(1)=C(2)-C(3)-C(4)-C(5)=C(6)`.\n    *   In our molecule, this corresponds to `C2(1)=C3(2)-C4(3)-C5(4)-C6(5)=C7(6)`.\n    *   The bond that breaks is the one between C4 and C5 (in the IUPAC numbering).\n    *   The new bond that forms is between C2 and C7 (in the IUPAC numbering).\n    *   Let's trace the substituents on this system:\n        *   On C2: a methyl group (C1).\n        *   On C5: a butyl group.\n        *   On C7: an ethyl group (C8-C9).\n    *   Applying the bond changes (breaking C4-C5, forming C2-C7) results in a new connectivity that forms a substituted cyclohexadiene ring. However, all the options provided (A, B, D) are *acyclic* dienes. This is a common point of confusion when first analyzing these rearrangements on paper. The Cope rearrangement of an acyclic 1,5-diene yields another acyclic 1,5-diene. My initial simple arrow-pushing on a 2D drawing was misleading.\n\n4.  **Re-evaluate the Cope Rearrangement Outcome for Acyclic Dienes:**\n    *   The Cope rearrangement essentially reshuffles the carbon skeleton and its substituents. A useful way to think about it is that the molecule is in equilibrium with another isomeric 1,5-diene.\n    *   Let's consider the starting material (SM) and the product listed in option A:\n        *   **SM:** 5-butylnona-2,6-diene\n            `CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH(C₄H₉)-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   **Option A:** 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n            `CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃`\n    *   Let's analyze the structures. The main chain part `CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-` is identical in both. The diene system `...-CH=CH-...` is also present. The key difference is the alkyl groups attached to the diene system.\n        *   In SM, we have a butyl group on C5 and an ethyl group on C7.\n        *   In product A, we have an ethyl group on C5 and a butyl group on C7.\n    *   The net result of the rearrangement between SM and A is the **swapping of the alkyl substituents at positions 5 and 7**. This is a characteristic outcome of a Cope rearrangement on this type of substrate. SM and A are two isomers in equilibrium via a Cope rearrangement.\n    *   The chain length changes in the name (nona- vs. undeca-) because IUPAC rules require naming the longest continuous carbon chain, which changes after the rearrangement swaps the end groups.\n        *   SM: C9 chain + C4 side chain = C13 total.\n        *   A: C11 chain + C2 side chain = C13 total. The atom count matches.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Other Options:**\n    *   **Option D:** 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene. This product has a terminal double bond (`CH₂=CH-`), which is generally less stable than the internal, disubstituted double bonds in the starting material. Thermal equilibria tend to favor the formation of more substituted (i.e., more stable) double bonds. Thus, D is an unlikely product.\n    *   **Option B:** 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene.\n        `CH₃-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₃`\n        Formation of this product would require breaking C-C bonds within the butyl group and rearranging the main chain itself (nona- to deca-). This is not a direct result of a simple pericyclic reaction like the Cope rearrangement. It would likely require harsher conditions or a more complex, multi-step radical mechanism, which is not typically implied by simply \"heating\".\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The most plausible reaction is a Cope rearrangement.\n    *   The Cope rearrangement establishes an equilibrium between the starting material and another isomer.\n    *   Option A, 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene, is the direct partner of the starting material in this Cope equilibrium. The reaction is essentially a swap of the two alkyl groups located on either side of the rearranging diene system.\n    *   The reaction will proceed towards the more thermodynamically stable product. Comparing SM and A, both have two disubstituted double bonds. However, in product A, the bulkier butyl group is on C7 (less hindered position at the end of the diene system) while the smaller ethyl group is on C5 (more hindered central position). In SM, the bulkier butyl group is at the more crowded C5 position. Therefore, product A is likely slightly more stable than the starting material, favoring its formation at equilibrium.\n    *   Therefore, heating 5-butylnona-2,6-diene would lead to the formation of 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."
