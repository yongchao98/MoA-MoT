    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    The problem asks for the specific pathway (route) and its probability for a hydrogen atom decaying from the $|n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$ state to the $|n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. This is a cascade decay process.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole Selection Rules:**\n    For an electric dipole transition to occur between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, so the final principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than the initial $n$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Transition:**\n    *   Initial state: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   Intermediate state: $|int\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   For decay, $n' < 3$. The lowest possible principal quantum number for an $l=1$ state is $n=2$. The options provided also point to the intermediate state having $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Transition:**\n    *   Initial state (for this step): The intermediate state, $|int\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Final state: $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Let's check if this transition is allowed for the possible intermediate states:\n        *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This value must be $0$ or $\\pm 1$. Since our possible intermediate states have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, this condition is satisfied for all of them.\n    *   This confirms that all three cascade routes are possible:\n        *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability of each Route:**\n    The probability of a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. We need to compare the transition rates for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$ for each possible $m'$.\n\n    The transition rate for spontaneous emission from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is given by Fermi's Golden Rule and is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n    $A_{i \\rightarrow f} \\propto |\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\mathbf{d} = e\\mathbf{r}$ is the electric dipole operator.\n    We need to calculate $|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$ for $m'=-1, 0, 1$.\n\n    The matrix element can be separated into a radial and an angular part. The radial integral, $\\int R_{2,1}(r) \\, r \\, R_{3,0}(r) \\, r^2 dr$, is the same for all three values of $m'$ and is non-zero. Let's call its value $I_{rad}$.\n\n    The key is the angular part. A powerful tool for this is the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which states:\n    $\\langle n'l'm' | T_q^k | nlm \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle n'l' || T^k || nl \\rangle}{\\sqrt{2l'+1}} \\langle lk; mq | l'm' \\rangle$\n    Here, the dipole operator $\\mathbf{r}$ is a rank-1 tensor ($k=1$) with components $r_q$ ($q=-1,0,1$).\n    *   Our initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $l=0, m=0$.\n    *   Our intermediate state is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, so $l'=1$.\n    *   The total squared matrix element is $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = \\sum_{q=-1,0,1} |\\langle f | r_q | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle lk; mq | l'm' \\rangle$ becomes $\\langle 0,1; 0,q | 1,m' \\rangle$. This coefficient is non-zero only if $m' = m+q = 0+q = q$, and its value is 1.\n\n    So, for a specific final state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, only one term in the sum over $q$ is non-zero (the one with $q=m'$):\n    $|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,m' | r_{m'} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\n    Plugging this into the Wigner-Eckart formula:\n    $|\\langle 2,1,m' | r_{m'} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = \\left| \\frac{\\langle 2,1 || r || 3,0 \\rangle}{\\sqrt{2(1)+1}} \\langle 0,1; 0,m' | 1,m' \\rangle \\right|^2 = \\left| \\frac{\\langle 2,1 || r || 3,0 \\rangle}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times 1 \\right|^2$\n\n    The reduced matrix element $\\langle 2,1 || r || 3,0 \\rangle$ contains the radial integral and is independent of any magnetic quantum numbers.\n\n    Therefore, the squared matrix element is:\n    $|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{1}{3} |\\langle 2,1 || r || 3,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\n    This result is **independent of m'**. This means the transition rates from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are all equal.\n\n6.  **Determine the Branching Ratio:**\n    Since there are three possible, equally probable, decay channels for the first step, the total transition rate is the sum of the three individual rates. The probability (or branching ratio) for any single channel is:\n    Probability = (Rate for one channel) / (Sum of rates for all channels) = $A / (A+A+A) = A / (3A) = 1/3$.\n\n7.  **Match with Options:**\n    We have determined that any of the three decay routes is possible, and the probability for the atom to take that specific path in the first step is $1/3$. Now we check the options:\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) Missing initial state, but assuming $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and a probability of $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\n    The only option that presents a valid route with the correct corresponding probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
