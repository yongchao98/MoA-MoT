    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are fermions. Fermions are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n2.  **Energy Levels of the Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy for a single particle in this potential well is quantized and given by the formula:\n    `En = n^2 * h^2 / (8 * m * L^2)` where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...` is the principal quantum number.\n    Using `ħ = h / (2π)`, the formula becomes:\n    `En = n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2 / (2 * m * L^2)`\n    The problem defines a base energy unit `E = π^2 * ħ^2 / (2 * m * L^2)`.\n    So, the single-particle energy levels can be conveniently written as `En = n^2 * E`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For a particle in this well, a complete quantum state is defined by the principal quantum number `n` and the spin magnetic quantum number `ms`. Since the particles are spin-1/2, `ms` can be either +1/2 (spin up) or -1/2 (spin down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two fermions, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    To find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions.\n    *   **Level n=1:** Energy `E1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`. We can place two fermions here (one spin up, one spin down). The energy contribution from these two particles is `2 * 1E = 2E`.\n    *   **Level n=2:** Energy `E2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`. We place the remaining two fermions here. The energy contribution from these two particles is `2 * 4E = 8E`.\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy:** We sum the energies of all four particles:\n        `E_ground = (2 * E1) + (2 * E2) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_first):**\n    The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2` and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n    *   We promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   The new configuration of particles is:\n        *   Two particles in `n=1` (Energy: `2 * E1 = 2E`)\n        *   One particle in `n=2` (Energy: `1 * E2 = 4E`)\n        *   One particle in `n=3` (Energy: `1 * E3 = 1 * 3^2 * E = 9E`)\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n        `E_first = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_second):**\n    The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-smallest increase in energy.\n    *   **Ground state configuration:** {2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2}. Energy = `10E`.\n    *   **First excited state:** {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. Energy = `15E`. This is a `n=2 -> n=3` promotion.\n    *   Let's consider other possible promotions from the ground state:\n        *   **Option 1: Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n            The configuration becomes: {1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n            Total Energy = `(1 * E1) + (2 * E2) + (1 * E3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n        *   **Option 2: Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n            The configuration becomes: {2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3}.\n            Total Energy = `(2 * E1) + (2 * E3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n        *   **Option 3: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n            The configuration becomes: {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n            Total Energy = `(2 * E1) + (1 * E2) + (1 * E4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n    *   Comparing the energies of the possible excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E,...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n    *   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** `E_second = 18E`.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Ground state energy = **10E**\n*   First excited state energy = **15E**\n*   Second excited state energy = **18E**\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
