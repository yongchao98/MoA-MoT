    "*   **Analysis of the Scenario:** The setting is a synthetic organic chemistry lab. A key activity in such a lab is not just making new compounds (synthesis) but also purifying the desired product from starting materials, byproducts, and solvents. The chemist's statement, \"my compounds are on top of each other,\" is a common piece of laboratory jargon that describes a failed separation attempt.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Separation Techniques:** We need to consider the common methods of separation in organic chemistry and which property they exploit.\n    *   **Distillation:** Separates liquids based on differences in boiling point. If two compounds have very similar boiling points, they would be difficult to separate this way.\n    *   **Chromatography (Thin-Layer Chromatography - TLC, and Column Chromatography):** This is arguably the most common and versatile purification technique in a synthetic organic lab. It separates compounds based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (e.g., silica gel, which is very polar) and a mobile phase (a solvent). The key property that governs how well compounds separate in this technique is **polarity**. Compounds with similar polarities will travel through the chromatography column or up the TLC plate at very similar rates. On a TLC plate, this would result in spots that are not resolved, appearing \"on top of each other.\" In column chromatography, the compounds would elute from the column at the same time, co-collecting in the fractions, meaning their bands are \"on top of each other.\" The phrase is a direct and frequent description of this specific problem.\n    *   **Recrystallization:** Separates compounds based on differences in solubility in a specific solvent at different temperatures.\n    *   **Extraction:** Separates compounds based on their differential solubility in two immiscible liquid phases (e.g., water and an organic solvent), which is also governed by polarity.\n\n*   **Connecting the Jargon to the Options:**\n    *   **A) Similar boiling points:** This relates to a distillation problem. While possible, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is most classically associated with chromatography.\n    *   **B) Non-covalent interactions:** These interactions are the fundamental basis for physical properties like boiling point and polarity, and thus are the reason separation techniques work. However, this is too general. The chemist is describing a specific outcome of a failed separation, not the underlying physics.\n    *   **C) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a physical property used for characterization of chiral molecules, not for separation (with the exception of specialized chiral chromatography, but the general principle still relies on differential interaction, not the value of the rotation itself). Two compounds can have different polarities and be easily separable, yet have similar or zero optical rotation. This is irrelevant to the separation problem.\n    *   **D) Similar polarities:** This is the most direct cause for a failed separation via chromatography, the most common purification method. If the polarities are very similar, the compounds interact with the stationary and mobile phases almost identically, leading them to move together. This perfectly explains why they would be \"on top of each other\" on a TLC plate or in a chromatography column.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The phrase \"on top of each other\" is standard jargon among organic chemists to describe compounds that cannot be separated by chromatography because they have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<D>>>"
