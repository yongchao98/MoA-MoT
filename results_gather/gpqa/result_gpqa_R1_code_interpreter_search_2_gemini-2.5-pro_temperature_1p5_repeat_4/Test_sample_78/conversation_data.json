    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**1. Analyze the Product from the Provided NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the structure of the product formed in the reaction. We are given its ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR spectra.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula of Product:** The starting material is C11H12O. The reaction involves a catalyst (DABCO) and heat, with no other reagents added. This suggests an isomerization or rearrangement reaction, so the product should also have the molecular formula C11H12O.\n    The degree of unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O is calculated as:\n    DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6.\n\n*   **¹³C-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), most likely a ketone. This accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **δ 21.3 (1C, s) and 28.4 (1C, s):** These are signals in the aliphatic region, corresponding to two different methyl (CH₃) carbons.\n    *   **δ 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s):** These six signals are in the alkene/aromatic region (100-160 ppm).\n        *   The signals at δ 126.9 and 129.1, each accounting for 2 carbons, are strong evidence for a symmetrically substituted benzene ring, specifically a para-substituted ring.\n        *   A para-substituted ring accounts for 6 carbons (4 unique signals: 2 quaternary, 2 CH).\n        *   The remaining signals in this region (δ 127.1, 130.3) must correspond to the two carbons of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This accounts for another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   So far, we have identified: a ketone (C=O), two methyl groups (2 x CH₃), a para-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄), and a C=C double bond.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s):** These two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons, confirm the presence of two methyl groups that are not adjacent to any protons. One must be attached to the aromatic ring (p-tolyl group), and the other is likely part of an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, is a classic signature for a para-substituted benzene ring. This confirms the presence of a p-tolyl group.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d):** These two doublets, each for 1 proton, must be the two protons on the C=C double bond. They are coupled to each other.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    Putting all the pieces together:\n    - A `p-tolyl` group (p-CH₃-C₆H₄-)\n    - An `acetyl` group (-CO-CH₃)\n    - A vinylene bridge (-CH=CH-)\n    The only way to connect these to satisfy the formula and NMR data is the structure of **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n    Structure: p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CO-CH₃.\n    This structure is an α,β-unsaturated ketone, which is a stable conjugated system. Its formula is C11H12O (C(7+2+2)=11, H(7+2+3)=12, O=1), which matches the reactant.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Reactant Options**\n\nNow we must determine which of the given options (Compound X) could rearrange to form this product. All options are epoxides with the formula C11H12O. The key is to find the one with the correct carbon skeleton.\n\n*   **Product Skeleton:** The product contains a **p-tolyl** group (a p-methylated phenyl ring).\n*   **Let's examine the options:**\n    *   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** `Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH-Me`. This contains a **phenyl** group (Ph), not a p-tolyl group.\n    *   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The 4-methylstyryl group is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-`. This is a **p-tolyl**vinyl group. The structure is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This contains the correct **p-tolyl** group.\n    *   **C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** `Ph-CH=C(CH₃)-CH(O)CH₂`. This contains a **phenyl** group.\n    *   **D) 2-styrylepoxide:** This is 2-styryloxirane, `Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This contains a **phenyl** group.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nUnder the reaction conditions, it is not possible to methylate a phenyl group to form a tolyl group. Therefore, the starting material must already contain the p-tolyl skeleton.\n\nOnly **Option B** has the p-tolyl group that is observed in the final product. The other options all have a phenyl group and thus cannot be the correct starting material. The reaction is an isomerization of the epoxide in option B to the α,β-unsaturated ketone identified from the NMR data. While the detailed mechanism for this specific epoxide-to-ketone rearrangement might be complex, the matching of the carbon skeleton between reactant B and the product is the definitive piece of evidence.\n\n(Note: There appears to be a flaw in the question's premise, as the product has two methyl groups while option B only has one. However, among the choices provided, B is the only plausible precursor due to the presence of the essential p-tolyl group, making it the intended answer.)\n\n<<<B>>>"
