    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:**\n    The fundamental principle we'll use is the conservation of total energy. For a relativistic system with a potential energy U, the total energy E is conserved. The total energy is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy (T) and the potential energy (U).\n    $E_{total} = T + U$\n\n2.  **Relativistic Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy:**\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and speed $v$ is given by $T = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator with spring constant $k$ at a displacement $x$ is given by $U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n3.  **Applying Conservation of Energy to the Oscillator's Motion:**\n    We will equate the total energy at two key points in the oscillation cycle:\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum displacement (x = A).** At this point, the mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v=0$.\n        *   Kinetic Energy (T): Since $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$. So, the kinetic energy $T = (1-1)mc^2 = 0$.\n        *   Potential Energy (U): The potential energy is at its maximum, $U = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        *   Total Energy (E_total): $E_{total} = T + U = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position (x = 0).** At this point, the restoring force is zero, so the acceleration is zero, and the speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        *   Kinetic Energy (T): The kinetic energy is at its maximum, $T_{max} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   Potential Energy (U): The potential energy is zero, $U = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        *   Total Energy (E_total): $E_{total} = T_{max} + U = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Equating the Energies and Solving for v_max:**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at Point 1 must equal the energy at Point 2.\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$:\n    *   Isolate the $\\gamma_{max}$ term:\n        $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n        $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    *   Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    *   To solve for $v_{max}$, we can first invert both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    *   Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    *   Rearrange the equation to isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The derived expression for the maximum speed $v_{max}$ matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
