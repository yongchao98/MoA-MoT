    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) at position 2.\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (:NH2⁻) acts as a base and removes a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom.\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions to the bromine at C-1:\n        *   C-2, which has a deuterium (D) atom.\n        *   C-6, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n    *   Since both sites can be deprotonated (or deuterated), two different pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6**\n        *   The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6.\n        *   The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        *   This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 remains on the ring. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne** (the deuterium is at the 3-position relative to the new C1-C6 triple bond).\n        *   *Note: Due to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond breaks more easily than the C-D bond, so this is the major pathway.*\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2**\n        *   The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2.\n        *   The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        *   This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n        *   *Note: This is the minor pathway.*\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (:NH2⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n        *   The intermediate is 3-deuterobenzyne (triple bond between C-1 and C-6, D at C-2).\n        *   The nucleophile :NH2⁻ can attack either C-1 or C-6.\n        *   **Attack at C-1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-1. Subsequent protonation at C-6 gives a product where the -NH2 is at C-1 and the D is at C-2. This is **2-deuteroaniline** (or *o*-deuteroaniline).\n        *   **Attack at C-6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-6. Subsequent protonation at C-1 gives a product where the -NH2 is at C-6 and the D is at C-2. The relationship between the -NH2 group and D is *meta*. This is **3-deuteroaniline** (or *m*-deuteroaniline).\n        *   So, Pathway A leads to **two** distinct products.\n\n    *   **Products from Benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n        *   The intermediate is the symmetrical, non-deuterated benzyne.\n        *   The nucleophile :NH2⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n        *   Due to symmetry, both attacks lead to the same carbanion, which is then protonated by the solvent (NH3) to yield a single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   So, Pathway B leads to **one** distinct product.\n\n4.  **Count the Total Number of Possible Products:**\n    *   From Pathway A, we get: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n    *   From Pathway B, we get: Aniline.\n    *   All three products (Aniline, 2-deuteroaniline, 3-deuteroaniline) are structurally different molecules.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible organic products is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nThe three products are:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-Deuteroaniline\n3.  3-Deuteroaniline\n\n<<<C>>>"
