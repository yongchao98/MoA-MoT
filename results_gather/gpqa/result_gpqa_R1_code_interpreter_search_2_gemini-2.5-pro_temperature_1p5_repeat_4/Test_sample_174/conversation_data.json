    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Identify the Physical Model**\n\nThe problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" with a specific shape (spheroid) and symmetry axis (z-axis). In electromagnetism, a time-varying charge or current distribution is the source of electromagnetic radiation. The radiation field is typically analyzed using a multipole expansion. The main types of radiation, in order of dominance for a source much smaller than the wavelength, are:\n1.  Electric Dipole radiation\n2.  Magnetic Dipole and Electric Quadrupole radiation\n3.  Higher-order multipoles\n\nThe lowest-order, non-zero term in the expansion dominates the radiation. For a general oscillating charge distribution, the electric dipole moment is the first moment of the charge distribution. A simple oscillation (like the entire spheroid of charge moving up and down the z-axis) will produce a time-varying electric dipole moment. For a higher-order multipole like the quadrupole to be the dominant source, the electric dipole moment must be zero for all time due to some special symmetry in the oscillation. The problem description is general and does not imply such a specific symmetry. Therefore, the most reasonable physical model to assume is that of an **oscillating electric dipole** along the z-axis.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Angular Dependence of Power**\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, is given by the formula:\n`dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)`\nwhere `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis), and `K` is a factor that depends on the frequency and the magnitude of the dipole moment, but not on the angle `θ`.\n\nThe function `f` in the problem is this `dP/dΩ`. The maximum power, `A`, is radiated when the `sin²(θ)` term is maximum.\n*   The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n*   So, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = K * 1 = K`.\n\nThe question asks for the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We can calculate the power at this angle:\n`P(30°) = (dP/dΩ)_θ=30° = K * sin²(30°)`\n\nSince `A = K`, we have:\n`P(30°) = A * sin²(30°)`\n\nThe fraction is `P(30°) / A`:\n`Fraction = (A * sin²(30°)) / A = sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`. Therefore:\n`Fraction = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nThis eliminates options A and D. We are left with options B and C.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Wavelength Dependence of Power**\n\nNow we need to determine how the radiated power depends on the wavelength `λ`. Let's look at the full expression for `dP/dΩ` for an electric dipole:\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32π² ε₀ c³) * sin²(θ)`\nwhere:\n*   `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment.\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe power is proportional to `ω⁴`. The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`.\nSubstituting this relationship into the proportionality:\n`Power ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nSo, the functional form `f(λ, θ)` must be proportional to `λ⁻⁴`. This is a classic result known as Rayleigh's law for scattering and radiation, which explains phenomena like the blue color of the sky.\n\n### **4. Combine the Results and Choose the Answer**\n\nWe have found two key pieces of information:\n*   The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The power is proportional to **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nLet's check the remaining options:\nB) 1/4, λ⁻³\nC) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n\nOur derived results match option C perfectly.\n\n*(Self-Correction/Alternative Check: If we had assumed the radiation was electric quadrupole, the power dependence would be `λ⁻⁶` and the angular dependence would be `sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`. This would give a fraction of 3/4 at `θ=30°`, corresponding to option A. However, as argued in step 1, the dipole model is the most appropriate for the given problem statement.)*\n\nFinal conclusion is based on the standard electric dipole radiation model.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Angular Dependence ---\n# Angle in degrees\ntheta_degrees = 30\n# Convert to radians\ntheta_radians = math.radians(theta_degrees)\n\n# For electric dipole radiation, power is proportional to sin^2(theta)\n# Maximum power is when sin^2(theta) = 1.\n# The fraction of maximum power at 30 degrees is sin^2(30).\nfraction = (math.sin(theta_radians))**2\n\nprint(f\"The fraction of maximum power at 30 degrees is: {fraction}\")\nprint(\"The wavelength dependence for electric dipole radiation is lambda^(-4).\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem describes the radiation from an oscillating charge distribution. In the far-field (radiation zone), such a system can be analyzed using a multipole expansion. The lowest and most dominant order of radiation for a generic oscillating charge is typically electric dipole radiation. We will proceed with this assumption, as there is no information in the problem to suggest that the electric dipole moment is zero.\n\n### Step 1: Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is given by:\n\n`dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis), and `K` is a constant that depends on the frequency and the dipole moment amplitude, but not on the angle `θ`.\n\nThe problem states that `f(λ, θ)` is the radiated power per unit solid angle, so `f = dP/dΩ`. The maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs when the angular term `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum.\n\n*   The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs when `θ = 90°`.\n*   Therefore, the maximum power is `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = K * (1) = K`.\n\nNow, we need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°` and express it as a fraction of the maximum power `A`.\n\n*   Power at 30°: `P(30°) = K * sin²(30°)`\n*   The value of `sin(30°)` is `1/2`.\n*   So, `P(30°) = K * (1/2)² = K/4`.\n\nSince `A = K`, the fraction of the maximum power is:\n\nFraction = `P(30°) / A = (K/4) / K = 1/4`.\n\nThis result eliminates options A and D.\n\n### Step 2: Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe full expression for the power radiated per unit solid angle for an electric dipole is:\n\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32π² ε₀ c³) * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `ω` is the angular frequency of the oscillation, `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment, `c` is the speed of light, and `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n\nFrom this expression, we can see that the power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the formula `ω = 2πc / λ`. Substituting this into the proportionality:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nSo, a possible form of the function `f` must have a `λ⁻⁴` dependence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining our two findings:\n1.  The fraction of maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n2.  The radiated power is proportional to **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nMatching these results with the given options:\n\nA) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\nB) 1/4, λ⁻³\nC) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\nD) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n\nOption C is the only one that matches both the fraction and the wavelength dependence.\n\n<<<C>>>"
