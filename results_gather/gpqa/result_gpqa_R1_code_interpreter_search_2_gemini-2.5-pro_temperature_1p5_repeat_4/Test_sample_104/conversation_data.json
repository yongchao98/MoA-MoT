    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Scenario\n\nThe problem describes a star that has a rotational brightness variation. This variation is caused by one hemisphere being \"clean\" and the other hemisphere being partially covered by cooler, dark spots. We see the star at its brightest when the clean hemisphere faces us, and at its dimmest when the spotted hemisphere faces us. The goal is to find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same brightness drop during a transit across a similar but unspotted star.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Brightness Variation Due to Spots\n\nThe brightness (or more accurately, the flux) of a star is related to its temperature by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the emitted energy is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (T⁴). We will compare the flux when the unspotted hemisphere faces us (maximum brightness, `F_max`) with the flux when the spotted hemisphere faces us (minimum brightness, `F_min`).\n\nLet's define the parameters:\n*   Star's effective temperature, `T_eff` = 6000 K\n*   Spot temperature, `T_spot` = `T_eff` - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   Spot filling factor on the spotted hemisphere, `f_spot` = 20% = 0.2\n\n**Maximum Flux (F_max):**\nWhen the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, the visible disk of the star is entirely at `T_eff`. The flux is proportional to the area of the disk and `T_eff`⁴.\n`F_max` ∝ `T_eff`⁴\n\n**Minimum Flux (F_min):**\nWhen the spotted hemisphere faces the observer, the visible disk is a mix of normal photosphere and cooler spots.\n*   A fraction `(1 - f_spot)` = 0.8 of the disk is at `T_eff`.\n*   A fraction `f_spot` = 0.2 of the disk is at `T_spot`.\n\nThe total flux from this mixed-temperature disk is a weighted average:\n`F_min` ∝ `(1 - f_spot) * T_eff`⁴ + `f_spot * T_spot`⁴\n\n**Amplitude of Variation:**\nThe amplitude of the light curve signal is the relative change in flux, normalized by the maximum (unspotted) flux:\nAmplitude = (`F_max` - `F_min`) / `F_max` = 1 - (`F_min` / `F_max`)\n\nSubstituting the expressions for flux:\nAmplitude = 1 - [`(1 - f_spot) * T_eff`⁴ + `f_spot * T_spot`⁴] / `T_eff`⁴\nAmplitude = 1 - [(1 - `f_spot`) + `f_spot` * (`T_spot` / `T_eff`)⁴]\nAmplitude = 1 - 1 + `f_spot` - `f_spot` * (`T_spot` / `T_eff`)⁴\nAmplitude = `f_spot` * [1 - (`T_spot` / `T_eff`)⁴]\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\nAmplitude = 0.2 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\nAmplitude = 0.2 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\nAmplitude = 0.2 * [1 - 625/1296]\nAmplitude = 0.2 * [671/1296]\nAmplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\nSo, the spots cause a brightness variation of about 10.36%.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Required Exoplanet Radius\n\nNext, we need to find the radius of an exoplanet (`R_pl`) that would produce an equivalent signal. When an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the starlight, causing a dip in brightness. For a pristine (unspotted) star, this dip, or \"transit depth,\" is the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n\nTransit Depth = (Area of Planet) / (Area of Star) = (π * `R_pl`²) / (π * `R_star`²) = (`R_pl` / `R_star`)²\n\nWe set this transit depth equal to the amplitude calculated from the starspots:\n(`R_pl` / `R_star`)² = Amplitude\n(`R_pl` / `R_star`)² ≈ 0.10355\n\nTo find the relative radius (`R_pl` / `R_star`), we take the square root of the amplitude:\n`R_pl` / `R_star` = sqrt(0.10355)\n`R_pl` / `R_star` ≈ 0.3218\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe relative radius of the hypothetical exoplanet would be approximately 0.32. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
