    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 to determine its molecular formula and the number of each type of bond.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula (CxHy):**\n    Let's count the carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms:\n    *   (CH3)2C= : 2 C in methyls + 1 C in chain = 3 C; 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n    *   =CH- : 1 C, 1 H.\n    *   -CH2- : 1 C, 2 H.\n    *   -CH(CH3)- : 1 C in chain + 1 C in methyl = 2 C; 1 + 3 = 4 H.\n    *   -CH2- : 1 C, 2 H.\n    *   -CH= : 1 C, 1 H.\n    *   =C(CH3)2 : 1 C in chain + 2 C in methyls = 3 C; 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n    *   **Total Carbon atoms (C):** 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Total Hydrogen atoms (H):** 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    Let's count each type of covalent bond within the molecule:\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds: one in `(CH3)2C=CH-` and one in `-CH=C(CH3)2`. So, there are **2** C=C bonds.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** The total number of bonds involving carbon is 4 for each carbon atom. Total bonds from 12 carbons is 12 * 4 = 48. This \"valence count\" must be satisfied by all bonds.\n        *   Each C=C bond counts as 2 valences from each of its two carbons. Total valences used by C=C bonds = 2 bonds * 4 valences/bond = 8.\n        *   Each C-H bond uses 1 valence from its carbon. Total valences used by C-H bonds = 22 bonds * 1 valence/bond = 22.\n        *   The remaining valences must be used by C-C single bonds. Total remaining valences = 48 - 8 - 22 = 18.\n        *   Since each C-C single bond uses 1 valence from each of its two carbons (total 2), the number of C-C bonds is 18 / 2 = **9**.\n    *   **Summary of bonds:** 22 C-H bonds, 2 C=C bonds, 9 C-C bonds.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound is the energy required to break all of its bonds to form gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all the bond energies in one mole of the compound.\n\n*   ΔH_atom(compound) = (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H)) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C))\n*   ΔH_atom(compound) = (22 × 400 kJ/mol) + (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol)\n*   ΔH_atom(compound) = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Constituent Elements**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation refers to the formation of the compound from its constituent elements in their standard states. For C12H22, the elements are 12 moles of solid carbon (graphite) and 11 moles of hydrogen gas (H2). We need to calculate the energy required to turn these into gaseous atoms.\n\n*   12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\n*   Energy for Carbon: 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = **12000 kJ**\n*   Energy for Hydrogen: 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = **1100 kJ**\n*   Total enthalpy of atomization of elements: 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation can be calculated using a Hess's law cycle:\nΔH_f = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\n\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options include a value in kJ/g. Let's convert our result to these units.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    M = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**\n*   **Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g:**\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ **11.446 kJ/g**\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 11.44 kJ/g\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol\nC) 11200 kJ/mol\nD) 1900 kJ/g\n\nOur calculated value of ~11.44 kJ/g matches option A.\n\n```python\n# Given data\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_H_H = 100         # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_C = 200         # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_equal_C = 300   # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_H = 400         # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular composition and bond count for C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\nnum_H2_moles = 11\nnum_C_equal_C = 2\nnum_C_C = 9\nnum_C_H = 22\n\n# Step 1: Enthalpy of atomization of the constituent elements from their standard states\n# 12 C(s) -> 12 C(g) and 11 H2(g) -> 22 H(g)\nenthalpy_atomization_elements = (num_C * enthalpy_atomization_C) + (num_H2_moles * bond_energy_H_H)\n\n# Step 2: Enthalpy of atomization of the compound (sum of its bond energies)\nenthalpy_atomization_compound = (num_C_equal_C * bond_energy_C_equal_C) + \\\n                                (num_C_C * bond_energy_C_C) + \\\n                                (num_C_H * bond_energy_C_H)\n\n# Step 3: Enthalpy of formation (ΔHf)\n# ΔHf = Σ(Enthalpies of atomization of elements) - Σ(Bond energies of compound)\nenthalpy_of_formation_mol = enthalpy_atomization_elements - enthalpy_atomization_compound\n\n# Step 4: Molar mass and conversion to kJ/g\nmolar_mass = (num_C * 12) + (num_H * 1)\nenthalpy_of_formation_gram = enthalpy_of_formation_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): {enthalpy_of_formation_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): {enthalpy_of_formation_gram}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>",
