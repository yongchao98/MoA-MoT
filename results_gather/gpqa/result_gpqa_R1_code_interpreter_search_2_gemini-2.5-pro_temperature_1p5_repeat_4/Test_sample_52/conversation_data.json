    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring with two substituents attached. The base formula for this part is C₆H₄.\n\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The molecule contains a -COO- functional group. This accounts for one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. The presence of only two signals for these four protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents, the four protons form an AA'BB' system, which often appears as two distinct doublets. These two signals account for 4 hydrogens.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n            *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH₃.\n            *   The proton H(b) is adjacent to both H(a) and the -CH₃ group. It will be split into a doublet by H(a) and then into a quartet by the three protons of the methyl group. This results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n            *   The proton H(a) is only adjacent to H(b). It will be split into a **doublet**.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). This group contributes 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens.\n        *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:**\n            *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (-CH=CH-CH₃). As it's coupled to H(b), its signal would be a doublet.\n            *   The second -CH₃ signal must belong to the other substituent.\n        *   **No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It means there are no methylene bridges in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n\n    *   We have a **para-substituted benzene ring** (C₆H₄).\n    *   One substituent is a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the **ester group** (-COO-) and the second **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n    *   To incorporate the ester and the methyl group without introducing any -CH₂- groups, there are two possibilities for the second substituent:\n        1.  An acetoxy group: -O-C(=O)-CH₃\n        2.  A methyl ester group: -C(=O)-O-CH₃\n    *   Regardless of which of these two is the correct one, the atomic count is the same: 2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Chemical Formula:**\n\n    *   Let's sum the atoms from all the identified parts:\n        *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 2 (from the ester/methyl substituent) = **11 Carbons**\n        *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from the second methyl group) = **12 Hydrogens**\n        *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Formula (Optional but Recommended):**\n\n    *   Let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n        *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Now, let's count the degrees of unsaturation in our proposed structure:\n        *   Benzene ring = 4 (1 for the ring itself + 3 for the double bonds)\n        *   Propenyl C=C double bond = 1\n        *   Ester C=O double bond = 1\n        *   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   The calculated DoU matches the structural features, confirming that C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is a plausible formula.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the chemical formula of the compound must be C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n```python\n# Let's count the atoms to confirm the formula.\n\n# Benzene ring part\nC_ring = 6\nH_ring = 4 # for a di-substituted ring\n\n# Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)\nC_propenyl = 3\nH_propenyl = 1 + 1 + 3\n\n# Ester substituent part\n# It contains the -COO- and a -CH3 group.\n# e.g., -O-CO-CH3 or -CO-O-CH3\n# In either case, it contains:\nC_ester_part = 2 # one C from C=O, one C from CH3\nH_ester_part = 3 # from the CH3 group\nO_ester_part = 2 # from the -COO-\n\n# Total counts\ntotal_C = C_ring + C_propenyl + C_ester_part\ntotal_H = H_ring + H_propenyl + H_ester_part\ntotal_O = O_ester_part\n\nprint(f\"The chemical formula is C{total_C}H{total_H}O{total_O}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The reasoning for determining the chemical formula is as follows:\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring Core:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This base structure is a benzene ring with two hydrogens replaced by substituents. The formula for this core is **C₆H₄**.\n\n2.  **First Substituent (from ¹H NMR):** The NMR spectrum shows two signals for vinyl protons (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH₃.\n    *   The H on the carbon next to the ring is split only by its neighbor on the double bond, appearing as a doublet.\n    *   The H on the next carbon is split by both the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   This propenyl group contributes **C₃H₅** to the formula (3 carbons and 1+1+3 = 5 hydrogens). One of the two -CH₃ signals in the NMR spectrum belongs to this group.\n\n3.  **Second Substituent (from FTIR and ¹H NMR):**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (**-COO-**), which accounts for **C** and **O₂**.\n    *   The ¹H NMR shows a second signal for a -CH₃ group.\n    *   The problem states there are no -CH₂ groups.\n    *   To combine the ester and the methyl group without a -CH₂ group, the substituent must be either an acetoxy group (-O-CO-CH₃) or a methyl carboxylate group (-CO-O-CH₃).\n    *   In either case, this substituent contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula (one carbon from the carbonyl, one from the methyl group, three hydrogens from the methyl group, and two oxygens from the ester).\n\n4.  **Assembling the Final Formula:** Now, we sum the atoms from all the identified parts:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 2 (from ester/methyl substituent) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from the other methyl group) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\nThe complete chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
