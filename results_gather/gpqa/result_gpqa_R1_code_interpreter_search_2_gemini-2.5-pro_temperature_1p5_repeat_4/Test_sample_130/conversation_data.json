    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   A single peak in the ¹H NMR spectrum means all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond).\n        *   Two peaks in the ¹³C NMR spectrum suggest two types of carbon atoms. The peak at ~137 ppm corresponds to the vinylic carbons (C=C), and the peak at ~165 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbons (C=O).\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride is a cyclic molecule with C₂v symmetry, making its two vinylic protons equivalent and its two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons equivalent, respectively.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4).\n        *   There are methyl groups attached to each of the four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4).\n        *   The fifth carbon of the ring (C5) is a CH₂ group.\n        *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   The product's molecular formula is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the given formula.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product. According to the **endo rule**, the kinetically favored product (and thus usually the major product) is the *endo* isomer. This is due to favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The *exo* product is typically the minor product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Major (Endo) and Minor (Exo) Products:**\n    *   **Major Product (Endo Adduct):** In the endo product, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 bridge (the CH₂ group from the original diene). This orientation forces the two protons originating from the maleic anhydride (let's call them H_a) into the *exo* position (pointing away from the C=C double bond of the norbornene system).\n    *   **Minor Product (Exo Adduct):** In the exo product, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. This orientation forces the H_a protons into the *endo* position (tucked under the C=C double bond).\n\n4.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals to Protons in the Product:**\n    *   The product molecule retains a plane of symmetry, simplifying the NMR spectrum.\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent H_a protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. They are alpha to carbonyl groups, hence their high chemical shift.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (the \"vinylic\" methyls at C2 and C3). ~1.7 ppm is a typical shift for vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). These methyls are on saturated sp³ carbons, so they appear at a lower chemical shift.\n    *   (Note: The two protons on the C7 bridge would be diastereotopic and appear as a complex multiplet, likely an AB quartet, but they are not directly relevant to options A and C).\n\n5.  **Use NOESY to Differentiate the Products:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially proximate protons.\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent (or weak) in the minor product's spectrum. We need to find two groups of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n6.  **Evaluate Spatial Proximity in Each Isomer:**\n    *   **Major (Endo) Product:**\n        *   The H_a protons are in the *exo* position.\n        *   The vinylic methyl groups (at ~1.7 ppm) are also on the exterior of the bicyclic system.\n        *   Looking at a 3D model, the *exo* H_a proton at C5 is very close to the vinylic methyl group at C2. Similarly, the H_a at C6 is close to the methyl at C3.\n        *   Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak is expected between the H_a protons (~3.5 ppm) and the vinylic methyl protons (~1.7 ppm).\n\n    *   **Minor (Exo) Product:**\n        *   The H_a protons are in the *endo* position, tucked under the six-membered ring.\n        *   This places them far away from the vinylic methyl groups, which are on the opposite face of the molecule.\n        *   Therefore, no significant NOE would be observed between the H_a protons and the vinylic methyl protons in the minor product.\n\n7.  **Match the Findings to the Options:**\n    *   The differentiating cross-peak connects the resonances of protons that are close only in the major (*endo*) product.\n    *   Our analysis shows this interaction is between the anhydride protons (H_a, a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and the vinylic methyl protons (a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm).\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n    *   Let's check the other options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls). These are on adjacent carbons and would show an NOE in both isomers.\n        *   B) and D) involve a \"1H doublet,\" which likely refers to one of the C7 bridge protons. In the major (*endo*) product, the H_a protons are *exo* and far from the C7 bridge protons. In the minor (*exo*) product, the *endo* H_a protons would be close to the *syn* C7 proton. So, an NOE involving H_a and a bridge proton would be characteristic of the *minor* product, not the major one.\n\nThus, the only option consistent with the experimental observation is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
