    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The relationship between the population of different energy levels and temperature in such a system is described by the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (level `j`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (level `i`) is given by:\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   `N_j`, `N_i` are the number of atoms in the respective energy levels.\n    *   `g_j`, `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to both stars:** Let the ratio of excited atoms to the atoms in the lower state be `R`.\n    *   For star_1 (temperature T_1): R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n    *   For star_2 (temperature T_2): R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n4.  **Use the information given in the problem:** The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This means `R_1 = 2 * R_2`.\n    Substituting the expressions from step 3:\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation:** The term `(g_j / g_i)` is a constant for the specific transition of the iron atom and is the same for both stars. Therefore, it cancels out from both sides of the equation:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n6.  **Solve for the temperatures by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:**\n    ln[ exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) ] = ln[ 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\n    Using the logarithm property ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b):\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[ exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\n    Simplifying the logarithm of the exponential term:\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n7.  **Isolate ln(2) and rearrange the terms:**\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n8.  **Substitute the given numerical values:** The problem states that the energy difference is `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The value of the Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n    Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is approximately equal to 1.\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K⁻¹`. (The unit is actually 1, as the Kelvin unit from the Boltzmann constant cancels out when multiplied by temperature, but in this form it's `J / (J/K) = K`. Let's re-evaluate the units. Wait, no, the exponent `-ΔE/kT` has to be dimensionless. `(J) / ((J/K)*K) = 1`. So `ΔE/k` has units of `K`. The equation is `ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`. So units are `dimensionless = (K) * (1/K)`, which works. Let's return to the assumption that `ΔE/k` = 1 (the number). The problem is set up for this simplification).\n\n    Substituting `ΔE / k = 1` into the equation:\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n9.  **Compare with the given options:** This derived equation matches option C exactly.\n\nA) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\nB) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\nC) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\nD) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n\nThe correct equation is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
