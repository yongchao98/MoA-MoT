    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Number of Protons (Integration)**\n\nFirst, let's sum the number of protons indicated by the integration values in the 1H NMR data:\n1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of protons in each of the possible structures:\n*   **Propenyl acetate** (CH₃-CH=CH-O-CO-CH₃): The molecular formula is C₅H₈O₂. It has 3 (from the propenyl methyl) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (vinyl) + 3 (acetyl methyl) = **8 protons**. This matches the NMR data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate** (e.g., 2-butenyl acetate, CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-O-CO-CH₃): The molecular formula is C₆H₁₀O₂. It has 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = **10 protons**. This does not match the NMR data.\n\nBased on the total number of protons, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and C). The unknown compound must be either cis- or trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Signals and Splitting Patterns**\n\nLet's analyze each signal from the provided data and see how it fits the propenyl acetate structure.\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet (s) for 3 protons around 2 ppm is highly characteristic of the methyl group in an acetate ester (-O-C(=O)-**CH₃**). This group has no adjacent protons, hence it's a singlet.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet (d) for 3 protons suggests a methyl group (**CH₃**) coupled to a single proton (-CH). This fits the methyl group on the propenyl double bond (**CH₃**-CH=).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)** and **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** These two signals, each for a single proton (1H), are in the vinyl region (typically 5-7.5 ppm), corresponding to the two protons on the double bond (-CH=CH-).\n    *   The signal at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means this proton is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and to a group of three protons (giving the quartet). This matches the proton adjacent to both the other vinyl proton and the terminal methyl group (CH₃-**CH**=CH-).\n    *   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet (d). This means this proton is coupled to only one other proton. This matches the proton adjacent to the ester oxygen and the other vinyl proton (-CH=**CH**-O-). It is further downfield (higher ppm) due to the deshielding effect of the electronegative oxygen atom.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Coupling Constant (J-value) to Determine Stereochemistry**\n\nThe final and most crucial piece of evidence is the coupling constant (J) for the signal at 7.0 ppm, which is **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value represents the coupling between the two protons on the double bond.\n\n*   For vinyl protons in a **trans** configuration (on opposite sides of the double bond), the coupling constant (³J_trans_) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   For vinyl protons in a **cis** configuration (on the same side of the double bond), the coupling constant (³J_cis_) is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant of 16.0 Hz falls squarely within the typical range for a **trans** double bond.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n1.  The proton count (8H) indicates a **propenyl acetate** structure.\n2.  The splitting patterns match the connectivity of a propenyl acetate molecule.\n3.  The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons confirms a **trans** configuration.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
