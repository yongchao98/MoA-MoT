    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is [Co(SCN)2], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **List the species:** In the solution, cobalt exists in several forms due to complexation with thiocyanate (SCN-). Let L represent the SCN- ligand. The cobalt-containing species are:\n    *   Co^2+ (free ion)\n    *   [Co(L)]+\n    *   [Co(L)2]\n    *   [Co(L)3]-\n    *   [Co(L)4]^2-\n\n3.  **Define the total cobalt concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(L)]+] + [[Co(L)2]] + [[Co(L)3]-] + [[Co(L)4]^2-]\n\n4.  **Use the stability constants (β):** The overall stability constants (βn) relate the concentration of each complex to the free metal ion and free ligand concentrations:\n    βn = [[Co(L)n]^(2-n)] / ([Co^2+] * [L]^n)\n    We can rearrange this to express the concentration of each complex in terms of [Co^2+]:\n    *   [[Co(L)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [L]\n    *   [[Co(L)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [L]^2\n    *   [[Co(L)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [L]^3\n    *   [[Co(L)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [L]^4\n\n5.  **Develop the mole fraction equation (α):** The mole fraction (αn) of a particular complex [Co(L)n] is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. We are interested in α2 for [Co(L)2]:\n    α2 = [[Co(L)2]] / c(Co)\n\n    Substitute the expressions from steps 3 and 4 into the equation for α2:\n    α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [L]^2) / ([Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][L] + β2[Co^2+][L]^2 + β3[Co^2+][L]^3 + β4[Co^2+][L]^4)\n\n    The [Co^2+] term appears in every term in the numerator and denominator, so it can be canceled out:\n    α2 = (β2 * [L]^2) / (1 + β1[L] + β2[L]^2 + β3[L]^3 + β4[L]^4)\n\n6.  **Determine the free ligand concentration [L]:** We are given the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M = 0.01 M and the total thiocyanate concentration [SCN-]_total = 0.1 M.\n    Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is significantly larger than the total metal concentration (0.01 M), the amount of ligand that is bound to the metal is small compared to the total amount of ligand. Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration [L] as the total ligand concentration.\n    [L] = [SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M.\n\n7.  **Calculate the fraction (α2):** Now, substitute the known values into the equation for α2:\n    *   L = 0.1\n    *   β1 = 9\n    *   β2 = 40\n    *   β3 = 63\n    *   β4 = 16\n\n    First, calculate the denominator (let's call it D):\n    D = 1 + β1*L + β2*L² + β3*L³ + β4*L⁴\n    D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\n    D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)\n    D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\n    D = 2.3646\n\n    Next, calculate the numerator for α2:\n    Numerator = β2 * L² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n    Finally, calculate α2:\n    α2 = Numerator / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n8.  **Convert to percentage:** To get the percentage, multiply the fraction α2 by 100:\n    Percentage = α2 * 100 ≈ 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%\n\nThis value corresponds to option B. I will use a python script to verify the calculation.\n```python\n# Given stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Given free ligand concentration (approximated as total SCN- concentration)\nL = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the mole fraction equation.\n# This represents the sum of the relative amounts of each species compared to the free metal ion.\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * L**1 + beta2 * L**2 + beta3 * L**3 + beta4 * L**4\n\n# The term for the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)2] in the denominator is beta2 * L**2.\n# This is also the numerator for the mole fraction of this species.\nnumerator_alpha2 = beta2 * L**2\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex.\nalpha2 = numerator_alpha2 / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage.\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n16.91618032648228\n\nThe calculation gives 16.916%, which rounds to 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning used to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the percentage of one specific cobalt complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)2]`, out of the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)2]` and multiplying it by 100.\n\n2.  **Identify the Species:** The cobalt(II) ions will form a series of complexes with the thiocyanate ligand (SCN⁻). Let's denote SCN⁻ as L. The species in equilibrium are:\n    *   `Co^2+` (the free, uncomplexed ion)\n    *   `[Co(L)]^+`\n    *   `[Co(L)2]` (the species of interest)\n    *   `[Co(L)3]^-`\n    *   `[Co(L)4]^2-`\n\n3.  **Define Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(L)]+] + [[Co(L)2]] + [[Co(L)3]^-] + [[Co(L)4]^2-]`\n\n4.  **Use Stability Constants (β):** The overall stability constants (βn) define the formation of each complex from the free metal ion and ligands:\n    *   `[[Co(L)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [L]`\n    *   `[[Co(L)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [L]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(L)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [L]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(L)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [L]^4`\n\n5.  **Formulate the Mole Fraction (α) Equation:** The mole fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(L)n]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`. We are interested in `α2` for `[Co(L)2]`:\n    `α2 = [[Co(L)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n    By substituting the expressions from steps 3 and 4, we get:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [L]^2) / ([Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][L] + β2[Co^2+][L]^2 + β3[Co^2+][L]^3 + β4[Co^2+][L]^4)`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term is common to the numerator and every term in the denominator, so it can be canceled out. This leaves a simplified equation that depends only on the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the stability constants:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [L]^2) / (1 + β1[L] + β2[L]^2 + β3[L]^3 + β4[L]^4)`\n\n6.  **Estimate the Free Ligand Concentration [L]:** We are given a total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` of 10⁻² M (0.01 M) and a total thiocyanate concentration of 0.1 M. Because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total metal concentration (0.01 M), the amount of ligand that gets bound to the metal will be relatively small compared to the total amount of ligand available. Therefore, we can make a common and valid approximation that the free ligand concentration `[L]` is approximately equal to the total ligand concentration.\n    `[L] = [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Mole Fraction `α2`:** Now, we plug the known values into our simplified equation:\n    *   `L = 0.1`\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n\n    Numerator = `β2 * L^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    Denominator = `1 + (β1*L) + (β2*L^2) + (β3*L^3) + (β4*L^4)`\n    Denominator = `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n    Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n    Denominator = `2.3646`\n\n    `α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n8.  **Convert to Percentage:** To find the percentage, we multiply the mole fraction by 100:\n    Percentage = `α2 * 100 = 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is very close to 16.9%.\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The calculation, verified by the Python code which yielded 16.916%, shows that the percentage of dithiocyanato cobalt(II) is approximately 16.9%. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
