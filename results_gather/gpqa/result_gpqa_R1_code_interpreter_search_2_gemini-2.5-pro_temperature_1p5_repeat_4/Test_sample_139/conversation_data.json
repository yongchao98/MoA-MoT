    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D or ²H), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a very close match. Therefore, substance B is heavy water, D₂O.\n\n2.  **Identify the Heavy Isotope in Substance X:** Since B (D₂O) is produced from the precipitate G, which in turn is a product of the reaction involving X, the heavier isotope mentioned in the description of substance X must be deuterium (D).\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   The problem states that \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   It also states that X contains deuterium. This points towards deuterated reducing agents, which are common in organic chemistry for introducing deuterium into molecules.\n    *   The most common such reagents are lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) and sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Their analogs are lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), respectively.\n    *   Let's test these candidates against the other clues.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   `X + Y (liquid) -> W (gas) + G (precipitate)`\n    *   `Heating G -> B (D₂O)`\n    *   This means the precipitate G must be a \"deuterated\" hydroxide or similar compound that releases D₂O upon heating. For example, a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)n. Heating would give `2 M(OD)n -> M₂Ox + n D₂O`.\n    *   The gas W's molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's test some possibilities.\n        *   D₂ (deuterium gas): Protons = 1 (from D) + 1 (from D) = 2. Neutrons = 1 (from D) + 1 (from D) = 2. Protons = Neutrons. This is a strong candidate.\n    *   For the reaction to produce G (M(OD)n) and W (D₂), the reactants must supply all the deuterium. X already contains D. If W is D₂, the liquid Y must also be a source of deuterium. The simplest liquid that is a source of deuterium is heavy water itself, D₂O.\n    *   Let's hypothesize `Y = D₂O`.\n\n5.  **Test X = LiAlD₄:**\n    *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent. (Correct)\n    *   Gas W = D₂. We confirmed P=N. (Correct)\n    *   Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃ (aluminum deuteroxide), which is a gelatinous precipitate. (Correct)\n    *   Heating G: `2 Al(OD)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`. This releases B = D₂O. (Correct)\n    *   Reaction with a keto acid: `R-CO-COOH`. LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids. The product of reducing a keto acid would be a diol, `R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH` (after H₂O workup). A keto acid (e.g., pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. The resulting diol (e.g., propane-1,2-diol, CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH) has 2 oxygen atoms. This matches the clue: \"The product... contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" (Correct)\n\n6.  **Test X = NaBD₄:**\n    *   Reaction with a keto acid: NaBH₄ is a milder reducing agent and only reduces ketones, not carboxylic acids. So, `R-CO-COOH` would become `R-CH(OH)-COOH`. The number of oxygen atoms would remain 3. This contradicts the clue about the product having 2 oxygen atoms. Therefore, X cannot be NaBD₄.\n\n7.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Required Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The lightest element (by atomic number Z) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The heaviest element (by atomic number Z) is Aluminum.\n    *   The problem specifies that X contains a heavier isotope, which we've identified as Deuterium (D or ²H). The problem's integer options suggest we should use integer mass numbers for the isotopes.\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen present is D, with a mass number of 2.\n        *   The stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n    *   The instruction for calculation is: \"...considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   Let's apply this instruction to the lightest and heaviest elements:\n        *   **Lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 instances (D₄) in the formula. Following the instruction, we must sum the masses of all these instances: 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is only 1 instance (Al) in the formula. The \"multiple instances\" condition does not apply. We take its mass: 1 × (mass of ²⁷Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Finally, we calculate the \"cumulative\" mass by summing these two results:\n    *   Total Mass = (Mass of all H atoms) + (Mass of all Al atoms) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
