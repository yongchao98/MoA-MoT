    "The interaction Lagrangian given is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f (v + X) \\psi_f = -\\lambda_f v \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f - \\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f $$\nThe second term, $\\mathcal{L}_{Xff} = -\\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f$, describes the interaction between the boson $X$ and a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$). This interaction allows the boson $X$ to decay into a fermion $f$ and its corresponding antifermion $\\bar{f}$, i.e., $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$.\n\nFor a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the decaying particle must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the decay products. For the decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$, this condition is:\n$$ m_X \\ge m_f + m_{\\bar{f}} $$\nSince a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n$$ m_X \\ge 2m_f $$\nWe are given that the mass of the boson $X$ is $m_X = 6$ GeV. Therefore, a decay into a specific fermion-antifermion pair $f\\bar{f}$ is kinematically allowed if the mass of the fermion $f$ satisfies:\n$$ 2m_f \\le 6 \\text{ GeV} $$\n$$ m_f \\le 3 \\text{ GeV} $$\nWe now need to check this condition for all fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) to determine which decay channels are open. We will use the approximate masses of the fermions:\n\n**Leptons:**\n*   Electron ($e$): $m_e \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.000511$ GeV. Since $0.000511 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n*   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_\\mu \\approx 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.1057$ GeV. Since $0.1057 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n*   Tau ($\\tau$): $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777$ GeV. Since $1.777 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n\n**Quarks:**\n*   Up ($u$): $m_u \\approx 2.2 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0022$ GeV. Since $0.0022 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is **allowed**.\n*   Down ($d$): $m_d \\approx 4.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0047$ GeV. Since $0.0047 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is **allowed**.\n*   Strange ($s$): $m_s \\approx 95 \\text{ MeV} = 0.095$ GeV. Since $0.095 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is **allowed**.\n*   Charm ($c$): $m_c \\approx 1.27$ GeV. Since $1.27 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is **allowed**.\n*   Bottom ($b$): $m_b \\approx 4.18$ GeV. Since $4.18 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **kinematically forbidden**.\n*   Top ($t$): $m_t \\approx 173$ GeV. Since $173 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **kinematically forbidden**.\n\nSummarizing, the kinematically allowed decay channels at the lowest order are into pairs of charm, strange, up, and down quarks, as well as tau, muon, and electron leptons.\nThe complete list of allowed decays is: $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}, s\\bar{s}, u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}, \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\nComparing this list with the given options:\nA) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$. Incorrect because it includes the forbidden decay into bottom quarks.\nB) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$. This list matches our findings perfectly.\nC) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$. Incorrect because it includes the forbidden decay into top quarks.\nD) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$. Incorrect because it includes the forbidden decay into bottom quarks and omits the allowed decays into muon and charm pairs.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
