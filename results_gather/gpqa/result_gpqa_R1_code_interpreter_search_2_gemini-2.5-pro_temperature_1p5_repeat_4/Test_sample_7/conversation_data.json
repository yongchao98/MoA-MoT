As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct conclusion from the experimental data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Single Mutants**\n\nFirst, let's understand the contribution of each gene by looking at the effect of its knockout compared to the wild-type control (100% resistance).\n\n*   **Wild-type (WT):** 100% resistance\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This means the G1 gene product is responsible for roughly 25% of the total resistance (100% - 75% = 25% loss).\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. This means the G3 gene product is responsible for roughly 50% of the total resistance (100% - 50% = 50% loss).\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This means the G2 gene product is essential for any resistance. Its loss completely eliminates resistance (100% loss).\n\n**2. Analyze the Double Mutants to Determine Gene Interactions (Epistasis)**\n\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene masks the effect of another. We can see this by comparing the phenotype of a double mutant to the phenotypes of the single mutants.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance.\n    *   Compare this to the single mutants: `g1` has 75% resistance, and `g2` has 0% resistance.\n    *   The phenotype of the `g1g2` double mutant is the same as the `g2` single mutant. This means the `g2` mutation is **epistatic** to the `g1` mutation (it masks the effect of `g1`).\n\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance.\n    *   Compare this to the single mutants: `g2` has 0% resistance, and `g3` has 50% resistance.\n    *   The phenotype of the `g2g3` double mutant is the same as the `g2` single mutant. This means the `g2` mutation is also **epistatic** to the `g3` mutation.\n\n**3. Identify the Transcription Factor**\n\nThe problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of others. In a genetic pathway, an upstream gene's mutation is often epistatic to a downstream gene's mutation. Since the `g2` mutation is epistatic to both `g1` and `g3`, and it causes a complete loss of function, G2 is the strongest candidate for an upstream transcription factor that regulates both G1 and G3.\n\n*   **Conclusion 1:** **G2 is a transcription factor** acting upstream of G1 and G3.\n\n**4. Analyze the Relationship Between G1 and G3**\n\nNow let's look at the `g1g3` double mutant to understand how these two genes interact.\n\n*   `g1` resistance = 75% (loss of 25%)\n*   `g3` resistance = 50% (loss of 50%)\n*   `g1g3` double mutant resistance = 10%\n\nIf the genes acted in completely separate, independent pathways, their effects would be additive. The expected resistance of the double mutant would be:\nExpected Resistance = 100% - (loss from g1) - (loss from g3) = 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%.\n\nHowever, the observed resistance is only 10%, which is much lower than the expected 25%. This type of interaction, where the double mutant shows a more severe phenotype than expected from the sum of the individual effects, is called **synergistic epistasis**. This synergy suggests that G1 and G3 have functions that overlap or compensate for each other. This is a classic example of **gene redundancy**. Both genes contribute to a common function (resistance), and while losing one is bad, losing both is catastrophically worse than expected because all functional redundancy is eliminated.\n\n*   **Conclusion 2:** **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy**.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate the choices based on our conclusions:\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   Incorrect. Our analysis points to G2, not G1, being the transcription factor.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* Correct.\n    *   *G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:* Correct.\n    *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* This specific statement is technically incorrect. For G1 to be epistatic to G3, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) would have to be the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%), which it isn't. However, the first two parts of this option are strongly supported by the data, making it the most plausible choice. The synergistic interaction between G1 and G3 is a form of epistasis, even if the directional claim is inaccurate.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   Incorrect. We cannot determine if they share a promoter from this data, and G3 is not epistatic towards G1 (10% is not 50%).\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   Incorrect. We have no evidence for pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits), and G1 is not epistatic towards G3.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nOption B provides the most accurate description of the genetic network. It correctly identifies G2 as the upstream transcription factor and correctly describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy based on their synergistic interaction. Despite the imprecise wording of the third clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\"), it is the best fit among the given choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
