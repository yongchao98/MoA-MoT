    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the initial state:**\n    The particle is spin-1/2 and its magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the \"spin-up\" state with respect to the z-axis. The z-component of spin, $S_z$, has an eigenvalue of $+\\hbar/2$.\n    The state vector at time $t=0$ is $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |\\uparrow\\rangle_z$.\n    In the standard basis where $|\\uparrow\\rangle_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|\\downarrow\\rangle_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, the initial state is $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n2.  **Define the new Hamiltonian:**\n    At $t=0$, the magnetic field is switched to $\\vec{B} = B \\hat{j}$ (the +Y direction).\n    The Hamiltonian of a magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ in a magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is given by $H = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}$.\n    Given that the magnetic moment is $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{S}$, where $\\vec{S}$ is the spin operator and $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio, the new Hamiltonian is:\n    $H = -(\\gamma \\vec{S}) \\cdot (B \\hat{j}) = -\\gamma B S_y$.\n    Here, $S_y$ is the y-component of the spin operator. In the standard z-basis, the spin operators are represented by Pauli matrices ($\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$):\n    $S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    So, the Hamiltonian is $H = -\\gamma B \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the time evolution of the system:**\n    The state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-iHt/\\hbar} |\\psi(0)\\rangle$. To calculate this, it is easiest to work in the basis of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian $H$. The eigenstates of $H = -\\gamma B S_y$ are the eigenstates of $S_y$. Let's call them $|\\uparrow\\rangle_y$ and $|\\downarrow\\rangle_y$.\n    *   The eigenvalues of $S_y$ are $+\\hbar/2$ and $-\\hbar/2$.\n    *   The corresponding eigenstates are:\n        $|\\uparrow\\rangle_y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ i \\end{pmatrix}$ (for eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$)\n        $|\\downarrow\\rangle_y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -i \\end{pmatrix}$ (for eigenvalue $-\\hbar/2$)\n    *   The energy eigenvalues for the Hamiltonian $H = -\\gamma B S_y$ are:\n        $E_\\uparrow = -\\gamma B (+\\hbar/2) = -\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$\n        $E_\\downarrow = -\\gamma B (-\\hbar/2) = +\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$\n\n4.  **Express the initial state in the new energy basis:**\n    We need to write our initial state $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |\\uparrow\\rangle_z$ as a linear combination of $|\\uparrow\\rangle_y$ and $|\\downarrow\\rangle_y$.\n    $|\\uparrow\\rangle_z = c_\\uparrow |\\uparrow\\rangle_y + c_\\downarrow |\\downarrow\\rangle_y$.\n    By inverting the relations for the y-eigenstates, we find:\n    $|\\uparrow\\rangle_z = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|\\uparrow\\rangle_y + |\\downarrow\\rangle_y)$.\n    So, $c_\\uparrow = 1/\\sqrt{2}$ and $c_\\downarrow = 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the state at time t:**\n    Now we can apply the time evolution operator:\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-iHt/\\hbar} |\\psi(0)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (e^{-iHt/\\hbar} |\\uparrow\\rangle_y + e^{-iHt/\\hbar} |\\downarrow\\rangle_y)$\n    Since $|\\uparrow\\rangle_y$ and $|\\downarrow\\rangle_y$ are energy eigenstates:\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (e^{-iE_\\uparrow t/\\hbar} |\\uparrow\\rangle_y + e^{-iE_\\downarrow t/\\hbar} |\\downarrow\\rangle_y)$\n    Substituting the energy values:\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (e^{-i(-\\gamma B \\hbar / 2)t/\\hbar} |\\uparrow\\rangle_y + e^{-i(+\\gamma B \\hbar / 2)t/\\hbar} |\\downarrow\\rangle_y)$\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (e^{i\\gamma B t/2} |\\uparrow\\rangle_y + e^{-i\\gamma B t/2} |\\downarrow\\rangle_y)$\n\n6.  **Calculate the expectation value of the z-component of the moment:**\n    We want to find $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle\\psi(t)| S_z |\\psi(t)\\rangle$.\n    Let's calculate $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle$. We can express $S_z$ in terms of the y-eigenstates. From the standard representations, we have $S_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}(|\\uparrow\\rangle_y\\langle\\downarrow|_y + |\\downarrow\\rangle_y\\langle\\uparrow|_y)$.\n    $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle\\psi(t)| S_z |\\psi(t)\\rangle$\n    $= \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\left( e^{-i\\gamma B t/2} \\langle\\uparrow|_y + e^{i\\gamma B t/2} \\langle\\downarrow|_y \\right) S_z \\left( e^{i\\gamma B t/2} |\\uparrow\\rangle_y + e^{-i\\gamma B t/2} |\\downarrow\\rangle_y \\right)$\n    Using the orthogonality of the basis states ($\\langle\\uparrow|_y|\\uparrow\\rangle_y=1, \\langle\\downarrow|_y|\\uparrow\\rangle_y=0$, etc.) and the expression for $S_z$ in this basis ($\\langle\\uparrow|_y S_z |\\uparrow\\rangle_y=0, \\langle\\uparrow|_y S_z |\\downarrow\\rangle_y=\\hbar/2$, etc.):\n    $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} [ (e^{-i\\gamma B t/2} e^{-i\\gamma B t/2}) \\langle\\uparrow|_y S_z |\\downarrow\\rangle_y + (e^{i\\gamma B t/2} e^{i\\gamma B t/2}) \\langle\\downarrow|_y S_z |\\uparrow\\rangle_y ]$\n    $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} [ e^{-i\\gamma B t} (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}) + e^{i\\gamma B t} (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}) ]$\n    $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} (e^{i\\gamma B t} + e^{-i\\gamma B t}) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n\n7.  **Identify the oscillation frequency:**\n    The expression for $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$ is a cosine function of time. The general form of an oscillation is $\\cos(\\omega t)$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\n    By comparing $\\cos(\\gamma B t)$ with $\\cos(\\omega t)$, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation is:\n    $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin's expectation value precesses around the new magnetic field axis (Y-axis) with the Larmor frequency, $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$. The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis oscillates with this same frequency.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe calculated frequency matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
