    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star = Star's effective temperature\n    *   R_star = Star's radius\n    *   a = semi-major axis of the planet's orbit\n    *   A = planet's albedo\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)\n    T_eq2 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)\n\n    When we take the ratio (T_eq1 / T_eq2), the terms for the star (T_star, R_star) cancel out because they are the same for both planets. The problem states that the albedos are the same (A_1 = A_2), so the term (1 - A)^(1/4) also cancels out.\n\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [(R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2)] / [(R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2)]\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = (1 / a_1)^(1/2) / (1 / a_2)^(1/2)\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n    This means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n4.  **Relate Radial Velocity (RV) Data to the Semi-major Axis:** The problem provides data from the RV method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) for each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (K, also known as the RV semi-amplitude) by:\n    K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\n    where c is the speed of light.\n\n    The RV semi-amplitude (K) for a star with a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) * sin(i)\n    where:\n    *   M_p = Planet's mass\n    *   M_star = Star's mass\n    *   G = Gravitational constant\n    *   i = orbital inclination\n\n    Since the planets are detected by the transit method, their orbits are nearly edge-on, so we can assume sin(i) ≈ 1 for both. Even if not exactly 1, it's a reasonable assumption that the inclination is similar for both planets in the same system, and thus sin(i) would cancel out in a ratio.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Semi-major Axis (a):** We rearrange the formula for K to solve for 'a'.\n    K^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a) * sin^2(i)\n    a = (G * M_p^2 * sin^2(i)) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-major Axes (a_2 / a_1):**\n    a_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2^2 * sin^2(i_2)) / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2 * sin^2(i_1)) / (M_star * K_1^2)]\n\n    The terms G, M_star, and sin^2(i) (assuming i_1 ≈ i_2) cancel out.\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_1^2)\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\n7.  **Calculate the Component Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n        M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n    *   **RV Semi-amplitude Ratio (K_1 / K_2):** This ratio is proportional to the Doppler shift ratio.\n        K_1 / K_2 = (c * Δλ_1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ_2 / λ_0) = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n        Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n        K_1 / K_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n8.  **Substitute and Calculate (a_2 / a_1):**\n    a_2 / a_1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\n    a_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n10. **Compute the Numerical Value:** To compare with the options, we'll compute the decimal value of the fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Ratio of masses squared\nratio_m_sq = (5/7)**2\n\n# Ratio of RV semi-amplitudes (proportional to doppler shifts) squared\nratio_k_sq = (0.03 / 0.04)**2\n\n# Ratio of semi-major axes (a2/a1)\nratio_a = ratio_m_sq * ratio_k_sq\n\n# Ratio of equilibrium temperatures (Teq1/Teq2) = sqrt(a2/a1)\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(ratio_a)\n\nprint(f\"{temp_ratio:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>\n0.5357\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357, which is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2.\n\n**1. Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a})^{1/2} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n**2. Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}$. Let's write out the expressions for each planet:\n\n$T_{eq1} = T_{star} \\times (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1})^{1/2} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4}$\n$T_{eq2} = T_{star} \\times (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2})^{1/2} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4}$\n\nWhen we divide $T_{eq1}$ by $T_{eq2}$, several terms cancel out. The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. It also states that both planets have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$.\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1})^{1/2} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\times (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2})^{1/2} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4}} = \\frac{(\\frac{1}{a_1})^{1/2}}{(\\frac{1}{a_2})^{1/2}} = (\\frac{a_2}{a_1})^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$.\n\n**3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude, K, for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K = (\\frac{M_p}{M_{star}}) \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{star}}{a}} \\times \\sin(i)$\n\nwhere:\n*   $M_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n*   $i$ is the orbital inclination. Since both planets are detected via transit, we can assume their inclination $i \\approx 90^{\\circ}$, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nLet's solve this equation for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 = (\\frac{M_p}{M_{star}})^2 \\times \\frac{G \\cdot M_{star}}{a} \\times \\sin^2(i) = \\frac{M_p^2 \\cdot G \\cdot \\sin^2(i)}{M_{star} \\cdot a}$\n$a = \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2 \\cdot \\sin^2(i)}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p2}^2 \\cdot \\sin^2(i_2)}{M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2}}{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p1}^2 \\cdot \\sin^2(i_1)}{M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2}}$\n\nAgain, several terms cancel: $G$, $M_{star}$, and $\\sin^2(i)$ (since $i_1 \\approx i_2$).\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = (\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}})^2 \\times (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^2$\n\n**4. Calculating the Ratios**\n\n*   **Mass Ratio:**\n    $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio:**\n    The RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift Δλ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n**5. Calculating the Final Result**\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (\\frac{5}{7})^2 \\times (\\frac{3}{4})^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
