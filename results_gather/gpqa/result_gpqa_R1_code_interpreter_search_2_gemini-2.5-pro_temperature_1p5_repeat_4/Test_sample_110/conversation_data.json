    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The reaction involves an enolate (from the ketone) acting as a nucleophile (the Michael donor) and an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate) acting as an electrophile (the Michael acceptor). The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, bulky base used to generate the enolate.\n\n2.  **Formation of the enolate (Michael donor):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The base deprotonates an α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) to form an enolate. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon, substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon, substituted with a methyl group and one **α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the bulky base t-BuOK can only deprotonate C6. This forms the kinetic enolate, where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic attack (Michael addition):**\n    *   The enolate attacks the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt).\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the enolate (C6) attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new C-C bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate. Subsequent protonation during workup yields the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Name of Product A:**\n    *   The new group attached to C6 is `-CH₂CH₂COOEt`.\n    *   The resulting molecule retains the cyclohexanone core with its original substituents, plus the newly added chain at C6.\n    *   To name this product (Product A), we treat the complex cyclohexanone ring as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain. The IUPAC naming convention for a cyclic substituent requires assigning C-1 to the point of attachment. The ring is then numbered to give the lowest possible locants to other functional groups, with the oxo group having high priority.\n    *   Let's number the substituent ring:\n        *   **C-1**: The point of attachment (originally C6). It has a methyl group.\n        *   **C-2**: The adjacent carbon bearing the carbonyl group (originally C1). It is an oxo group.\n        *   **C-3**: The adjacent quaternary carbon (originally C2). It has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   The name of the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → B\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is another Michael addition reaction. The α-protons of nitroalkanes are acidic and can be removed by a base to form a nitronate anion, which is an excellent Michael donor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the nucleophile:**\n    *   The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   This creates the nucleophilic nitronate anion: [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic attack:**\n    *   The nucleophile attacks the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The α-carbon of the nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of the unsaturated nitrile (the CH carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new C-C bond is formed. Protonation by the solvent (H₂O) neutralizes the intermediate to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   The new structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂) - CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this product (Product B), we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The IUPAC name will end in \"-nitrile\".\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        `CH₃(C6)-CH₂(C5)-CH(NO₂)(C4)-CH(CH₃)(C3)-CH₂(C2)-CN(C1)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents on this chain are:\n        *   A methyl group at C3.\n        *   A nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nMatching these products with the given options, we find that option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
