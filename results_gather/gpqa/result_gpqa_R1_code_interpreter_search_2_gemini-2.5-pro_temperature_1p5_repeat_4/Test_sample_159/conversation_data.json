    "An N-sided polygon with an infinitely large N approaches the shape of a circle.\nThe apothem of a regular N-sided polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. This is also the radius of the inscribed circle. As N approaches infinity, the length of the sides approaches zero, and the inscribed circle and the circumscribed circle become identical. Therefore, the apothem `a` of the N-sided polygon becomes the radius of the limiting circular aperture.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nFor Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture, the intensity distribution in the far field is described by the Airy pattern. The intensity `I` as a function of the angle `θ` from the central axis is given by:\n\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`\n\nwhere:\n*   `I₀` is the intensity at the center of the pattern.\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number, with `λ` being the wavelength of the light.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n\nThe minima (dark rings) of the diffraction pattern occur at angles `θ` where the numerator is zero, which means `J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0`.\nLet `x = k * a * sin(θ)`. The minima correspond to the zeros of the `J₁(x)` function (excluding `x=0`, which is the central maximum).\n\nThe first two non-zero roots of the `J₁(x)` function are:\n*   `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nFor the first minimum, we have:\n`k * a * sin(θ₁) = x₁`\n`(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ₁) ≈ 3.8317`\n\nUsing the small angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), we get:\n`θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n\nFor the second minimum, we have:\n`k * a * sin(θ₂) = x₂`\n`(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ₂) ≈ 7.0156`\n\nUsing the small angle approximation, we get:\n`θ₂ ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\n`Δθ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a (This is the position of the first minimum)\nC) 1.220 λ /a\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5068 * (λ / a)` is closest to `0.506 * (λ / a)`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
