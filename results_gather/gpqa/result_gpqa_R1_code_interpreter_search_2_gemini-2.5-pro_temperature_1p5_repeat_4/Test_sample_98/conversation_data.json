    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is characteristic of a carboxylic acid's carbonyl group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible structures (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), so this information is consistent with all options but does not help distinguish between them.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in interpreting the complex splitting patterns described. The splitting of a proton's signal is determined by the number of non-equivalent protons on the adjacent carbons (the n+1 rule). A complex splitting pattern like a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, consistent with this information.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a single proton (let's call it H_A) is coupled to:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving a doublet, n=1).\n    *   A group of two neighboring protons (giving a triplet, n=2).\n    *   A group of three neighboring protons (giving a quartet, n=3).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different single proton (let's call it H_B) is coupled to:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving a doublet, n=1).\n    *   A group of two neighboring protons (giving a triplet, n=2).\n    *   Another, different group of two neighboring protons (giving another triplet, n=2).\n\n### 3. Evaluating Each Candidate Structure\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons on the chiral centers (methine, -CH- groups) for each molecule, as these are the most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\nStructure: `(CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\nThe protons on the main chain carbons C3 and C4 would show the most complex splitting, but neither would produce a `dtt` or `dtq`. For instance, the H on C3 is coupled to 2 protons on C2 and 1 proton on C4, giving a triplet of doublets (`td`). The H on C4 is coupled to 1 proton on C3 and the 6 protons of the isopropyl methyls, giving a doublet of septets. This structure is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**\nStructure: `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`\nLet's analyze the methine protons on C3 and C4.\n*   H on C4: Is coupled to H on C3 (1H), the CH₂ on C5 (2H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl side chain (2H). This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   H on C3: Is coupled to H on C4 (1H) and the CH₂ of its ethyl side chain (2H). This would produce a doublet of triplets (`dt`).\nThis structure provides the `dtt` signal but not the `dtq` signal. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\nStructure: `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`\nThe most complex signal here comes from the H on C3, which is coupled to the H on C2 (1H) and the CH₂ on C4 (2H), giving a doublet of triplets (`dt`). This structure is incorrect as it lacks both a `dtt` and a `dtq`.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nStructure: `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`\nLet's draw this out and number the carbons of the main chain, starting from the carboxyl group.\n```\n        Et      Et\n        |       |\n(5)CH₃ - (4)CHª - (3)CHᵇ - (2)CH₂ - (1)COOH\n```\n*   **Proton Hᵇ (on C3):**\n    *   Is coupled to **Hª on C4** (1 neighbor) -> **doublet**.\n    *   Is coupled to the **protons on C2** (2 neighbors) -> **triplet**.\n    *   Is coupled to the **CH₂ protons of its ethyl group** (2 neighbors) -> **triplet**.\n    *   The resulting signal for Hᵇ is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second signal described.\n\n*   **Proton Hª (on C4):**\n    *   Is coupled to **Hᵇ on C3** (1 neighbor) -> **doublet**.\n    *   Is coupled to the **CH₂ protons of its ethyl group** (2 neighbors) -> **triplet**.\n    *   Is coupled to the **CH₃ protons on C5** (3 neighbors) -> **quartet**.\n    *   The resulting signal for Hª is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first signal described.\n\n### Conclusion\nStructure D is the only candidate that would produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets and a doublet of triplets of quartets in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
