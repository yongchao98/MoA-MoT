    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand and Define Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus with mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0` and its initial kinetic energy is `T_initial = 0`.\n    *   The total initial energy is `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   The more massive fragment is `m1`, and the less massive is `m2`.\n    *   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the fragments' rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments move with kinetic energies `T1` and `T2` and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n    *   The total final energy is `E_final = (m1c^2 + T1) + (m2c^2 + T2)`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Masses and Rest Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two linear equations for the fragment masses:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate their rest-mass energies using the initial rest-mass energy `Mc^2 = 300 GeV = 300,000 MeV`:\n*   `m1c^2 = 0.66 * Mc^2 = 0.66 * 300,000 MeV = 198,000 MeV`\n*   `m2c^2 = 0.33 * Mc^2 = 0.33 * 300,000 MeV = 99,000 MeV`\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   `E_initial = E_final`\n    *   `Mc^2 = (m1c^2 + T1) + (m2c^2 + T2)`\n    *   The total kinetic energy released in the fission (also known as the Q-value) is:\n        `Q = T1 + T2 = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n        `Q = 300,000 MeV - (198,000 MeV + 99,000 MeV)`\n        `Q = 300,000 MeV - 297,000 MeV = 3,000 MeV`\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   `p_initial = p_final`\n    *   Since the initial nucleus is at rest, `p_initial = 0`.\n    *   The final momentum is `p1 + p2`. For the total momentum to be zero, the fragments must move in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum.\n    *   `p1 = -p2`, which means `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n**4. Calculate `T1` using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` are related by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nWe can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2 * m1)) / (p^2 / (2 * m2)) = m2 / m1`\nSince `m1 = 2 * m2`, the ratio is `m2 / (2 * m2) = 1/2`.\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3,000 MeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3,000 MeV`\n`T1_classical = 1,000 MeV`\n\n**5. Calculate `T1` using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, where `E = T + mc^2` is the total energy of a particle.\nRearranging for momentum: `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n\nSince the momenta `p1` and `p2` have equal magnitudes, their `(pc)^2` values are also equal:\n`(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1c^2) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2c^2)`\n\nWe know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3,000 - T1`. Let's substitute this and the rest-mass energies (in MeV) into the equation:\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198000) = (3000 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3000 - T1) * (99000)`\n\nExpand both sides:\n`T1^2 + 396000 * T1 = (9,000,000 - 6000 * T1 + T1^2) + (594,000,000 - 198,000 * T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396000 * T1 = 9,000,000 - 6000 * T1 + 594,000,000 - 198,000 * T1`\n\nGroup the terms:\n`396000 * T1 = 603,000,000 - 204,000 * T1`\n`396000 * T1 + 204,000 * T1 = 603,000,000`\n`600,000 * T1 = 603,000,000`\n`T1_relativistic = 603,000,000 / 600,000 = 1005 MeV`\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nTo be certain of the calculation, we can use Python.\n```python\n# Initial rest mass energy of the nucleus in MeV\nMc2 = 300 * 1000\n\n# Calculate fragment rest mass energies in MeV\n# m1 = 2 * m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n# This gives m1 = 0.66 * M and m2 = 0.33 * M\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\n\n# Calculate total kinetic energy released (Q-value) in MeV\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# --- Classical Calculation for T1 ---\n# From momentum conservation, T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2\n# T1 + T2 = Q  => T1 + 2*T1 = Q  => 3*T1 = Q\nT1_classical = Q / 3\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation for T1 ---\n# From momentum conservation, (p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c2, where T2 = Q - T1\n# We can solve this equation for T1. An elegant rearrangement leads to:\n# T1 * (2 * Mc2) = Q * (Q + 2*m2c2)\nT1_relativistic = (Q * (Q + 2 * m2c2)) / (2 * Mc2)\n\n# Calculate the difference\ndifference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n> Classical T1: 1000.00 MeV\n> Relativistic T1: 1005.00 MeV\n> Difference: 5.00 MeV\n\nThe result from the calculation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Define Variables and Initial Conditions**\n\n*   Initial rest mass of the nucleus: `M`\n*   Initial rest mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV = 300,000 MeV`\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial total energy is `E_initial = Mc²`, and its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   Fragment rest masses: `m₁` (more massive) and `m₂` (less massive).\n*   Kinetic energies of fragments: `T₁` (for `m₁`) and `T₂` (for `m₂`).\n*   Given relationships:\n    *   `m₁ = 2 * m₂`\n    *   `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n\n**2. Calculate Fragment Rest Mass Energies**\n\nWe have a system of two equations. Substitute the first into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99 * M  =>  m₂ = 0.33 * M`\nAnd for `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, let's find their rest mass energies:\n*   `m₁c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300,000 MeV = 198,000 MeV`\n*   `m₂c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300,000 MeV = 99,000 MeV`\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy to Find Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (`Q`) is the difference between the initial rest mass energy and the final total rest mass energy.\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²) `\n`Q = 300,000 MeV - (198,000 MeV + 99,000 MeV)`\n`Q = 300,000 MeV - 297,000 MeV = 3,000 MeV`\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest (`p_initial = 0`), the fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`\n\n**5. Calculate T₁ using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   `T₁_classical = p² / (2m₁)`\n*   `T₂_classical = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nFrom these equations, we can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = m₂ / (2m₂) = 1/2`\nSo, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = Q`\n`T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3,000 MeV`\n`3 * T₁_classical = 3,000 MeV`\n`T₁_classical = 1,000 MeV`\n\n**6. Calculate T₁ using Correct (Relativistic) Formulas**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest mass (`m`) is `E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²`. The total energy is `E = T + m₀c²`.\nSo, `(pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)² = (T + m₀c²)² - (m₀c²)² = T² + 2T(m₀c²)`.\n\nSince `|p₁| = |p₂|`, we have `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n`T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²) `\n\nSubstitute `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3,000 - T₁` into the equation:\n`T₁² + 2T₁(198,000) = (3,000 - T₁)² + 2(3,000 - T₁)(99,000)`\n`T₁² + 396,000T₁ = (9,000,000 - 6,000T₁ + T₁²) + (594,000,000 - 198,000T₁)`\n\nThe `T₁²` terms cancel out. Grouping the `T₁` terms on one side and the constants on the other:\n`396,000T₁ + 6,000T₁ + 198,000T₁ = 9,000,000 + 594,000,000`\n`600,000T₁ = 603,000,000`\n`T₁ = 603,000,000 / 600,000`\n`T₁ = 1,005 MeV`\n\n**7. Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct value (`T₁`) and the classical approximation (`T₁_classical`) is:\n`Difference = T₁ - T₁_classical = 1,005 MeV - 1,000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<C>>>"
