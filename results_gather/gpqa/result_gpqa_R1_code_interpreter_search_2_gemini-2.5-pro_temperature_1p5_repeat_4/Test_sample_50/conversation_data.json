    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Setup:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which is a crucial piece of information. It means the electric potential of the entire sphere is held constant at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). We need to find the total potential energy of this system.\n\n2.  **Introduce the Method of Images:** This problem is a classic application of the \"method of images\" in electrostatics. To satisfy the boundary condition (`V=0` on the sphere's surface), we can replace the physical sphere and its induced surface charge with a single, imaginary \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere are then the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n3.  **Find the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    *   Let the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is on the z-axis at `z=d`. Due to symmetry, the image charge `q'` must also lie on the z-axis at some position `z=b`, where `b < R`.\n    *   The potential at any point `P` on the surface of the sphere must be zero. The potential at `P` is the sum of the potentials from `q` and `q'`.\n    *   `V(P) = V_q + V_{q'} = k * (q / r_1 + q' / r_2) = 0`, where `r_1` is the distance from `q` to `P`, and `r_2` is the distance from `q'` to `P`.\n    *   Solving this boundary condition for all points on the sphere gives the standard results for the image charge:\n        *   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n        *   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    *   The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n    *   A common mistake is to calculate the potential energy of two point charges, `U = kqq' / (d-b)`. This is incorrect because the image charge `q'` isn't a fixed charge; it's a representation of the induced charge, which itself is created by `q`.\n    *   The correct formula for the energy of a point charge `q` in the presence of conductors is:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n        where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by all other charges (i.e., the induced charges on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 accounts for the fact that the induced charge is not independent of `q`.\n\n5.  **Calculate V_induced:**\n    *   The potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` (at `z=d`) is, by the method of images, equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same point.\n    *   The distance between the position of `q` (at `d`) and the position of `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   So, `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b` into the equation for `V_induced`:\n        `V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Now substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n        `V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n        The `d` in the numerator's denominator cancels with the `d` in the denominator's denominator.\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy (U):**\n    *   Now, use the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated energy `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option A.\n    *   The negative sign is physically correct, indicating an attractive force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere. The system is in a lower energy state (more stable) than when the charge `q` is at infinity.\n\n---\n<<<A>>>"
