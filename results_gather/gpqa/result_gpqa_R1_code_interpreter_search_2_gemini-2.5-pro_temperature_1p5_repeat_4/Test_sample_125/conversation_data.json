    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Let's identify its key features. It's a ketone with a six-carbon chain. It has a methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 5. The stereochemistry at position 5 is defined as (S). This means the starting material is a single, pure enantiomer.\n    *   **Reagents:** The molecule is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone functional group (C=O) at position 3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of the ketone at C-3 creates a new chiral center. The original chiral center at C-5 remains unaffected by the reaction. Since the carbonyl group at C-3 is planar, the hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either face. This leads to the formation of two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n    *   **Products of Reaction I:** The reaction will produce two compounds:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Relationship between Products:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the spatial arrangement at one (but not all) of their stereocenters. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Let's call them **D1** and **D2**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a diketone. Importantly, this molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Reagents:** The molecule is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent capable of reducing ketones, followed by an acidic workup. \"Excess\" ensures that both ketone groups are reduced to alcohols.\n    *   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction of the ketones at C-2 and C-4 creates two new chiral centers.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n        *   Because the molecule is symmetric (the substituents on C-2 and C-4 are the same), the (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) forms are identical and represent a single, achiral **meso compound**. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to internal symmetry.\n    *   **Products of Reaction II:** Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The products are:\n        1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (**E1**)\n        2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (**E2**)\n        3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (**M**)\n    *   The enantiomers E1 and E2 will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture. The meso compound M is a diastereomer of E1 and E2.\n\n3.  **Combine the Products and Analyze by HPLC**\n    *   The final mixture contains all the products from both reactions. There are a total of five distinct stereoisomers: **D1, D2, E1, E2, M**.\n\n4.  **Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n    *   A normal-phase HPLC column is an **achiral** separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like D1 and D2) have different physical properties (e.g., dipole moment, boiling point, solubility, polarity) and can be separated on an achiral column. So, D1 and D2 will produce two separate peaks.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like E1 and E2) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated by an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   The **meso compound** (M) is a diastereomer of the enantiomers (E1 and E2). Therefore, it has different physical properties and will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. It will produce its own peak.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers and are structurally very different. They will have different polarities and will be well separated from each other.\n    *   Counting the peaks:\n        *   Peak 1: D1\n        *   Peak 2: D2\n        *   Peak 3: The co-eluting enantiomers (E1 + E2)\n        *   Peak 4: The meso compound M\n    *   Therefore, the normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n\n5.  **Analysis with Chiral HPLC**\n    *   An HPLC column with a **chiral stationary phase** is designed to interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   **Diastereomers** D1 and D2 will be separated, giving two peaks.\n    *   **Enantiomers** E1 and E2, which co-eluted on the normal-phase column, will be resolved by the chiral column, giving two separate peaks.\n    *   The **meso compound** M is achiral and will elute as a single peak, separated from E1 and E2 (its diastereomers).\n    *   Counting the peaks:\n        *   Peak 1: D1\n        *   Peak 2: D2\n        *   Peak 3: E1\n        *   Peak 4: E2\n        *   Peak 5: M\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all five stereoisomers and show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the combined product mixture will show 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>"
