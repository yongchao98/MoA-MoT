    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a substituted lactone named `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. Let's break down this name to understand its structure:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro-..-2-one**: The ring is saturated (tetrahydro) and has a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2. This structure is a cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to carbon at position 4 of the ring.\n*   **(R) or (S)**: This indicates the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is C4 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nThe structure is as follows (with IUPAC numbering):\n```\n      O=C(2)---C(3)H2\n     /         \\\n    O(1)        C(4)H-Et   <-- Chiral Center\n     \\         /\n      C(6)H2---C(5)H2\n```\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options provided are all enantiomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Let's determine its structure:\n*   **pentanoic acid**: A 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This indicates that at C5, there is an isobutyl ester group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`, where iBu is `-CH2CH(CH3)2`).\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group is attached to C3.\n*   **(R) or (S)**: The stereochemistry is at C3, the chiral center.\n\nThe structure is:\n`HOOC(1)-C(2)H2-C(3)H(Et)-C(4)H2-C(5)(=O)O-iBu`\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents, which have different selectivities for esters and carboxylic acids.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n    *   LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent that reduces esters much faster than carboxylic acids. In a molecule containing both, it will primarily reduce the ester group to a primary alcohol.\n    *   `A + LiBH₄`: The ester group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    *   `iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` → `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   The intermediate is `3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid`.\n    *   **Lactonization**: The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes intramolecular esterification. The hydroxyl (-OH) group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group at C1 to form the 6-membered lactone ring. This reaction does not invert the stereocenter.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: BH₃ (Borane)**\n    *   BH₃ is a selective reducing agent that reduces carboxylic acids much faster than esters. In a molecule containing both, it will primarily reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol.\n    *   `B + BH₃`: The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    *   `iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` → `iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n    *   The intermediate is `isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate`.\n    *   **Lactonization (Transesterification)**: The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks the ester carbonyl to form the 6-membered lactone ring, releasing isobutanol. This reaction does not invert the stereocenter.\n\n**4. Track the Stereochemistry (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Rules)**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to determine how the R/S designation changes (or doesn't change) during the reduction step, as the stereocenter itself is not involved in the reaction. This depends on whether the priority ranking of the groups attached to the stereocenter changes.\n\n**Stereochemistry of Reaction 1: A → (R)-lactone**\n1.  **Priorities in Starting Material (A):** The stereocenter C3 is attached to:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` (Highest priority - Ester group)\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Second highest - Acid group)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest priority)\n2.  **Transformation:** LiBH₄ reduces group 1 (ester) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The original group 2 (acid) is unchanged.\n3.  **Priorities in Intermediate (`3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid`):**\n    1.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Now highest priority)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (Now second highest)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n    4.  `-H`\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The priority of the top two groups has swapped. According to CIP rules, when two groups on a chiral center swap priority, the R/S designation inverts.\n    *   `Configuration(Intermediate) = Inverse of Configuration(A)`\n5.  **Lactonization Step:** The priority of the groups does not change during lactonization. Therefore, `Configuration(Product) = Configuration(Intermediate)`.\n6.  **Overall:** `Configuration(Product) = Inverse of Configuration(A)`.\n7.  Given that the product is **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must have been **(S)**.\n    *   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Stereochemistry of Reaction 2: B → (S)-lactone**\n1.  **Priorities in Starting Material (B):** Same as for A.\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH`\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n    4.  `-H`\n2.  **Transformation:** BH₃ reduces group 2 (acid) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The original group 1 (ester) is unchanged.\n3.  **Priorities in Intermediate (`isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate`):**\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` (Still highest priority)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (Now second highest)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n    4.  `-H`\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The priority ranking of the groups has not changed. Group 1 remains group 1. The original group 2 becomes a new group, but it is still lower priority than group 1 and higher priority than group 3. The R/S designation is therefore retained.\n    *   `Configuration(Intermediate) = Configuration(B)`\n5.  **Lactonization Step:** This step preserves the configuration. `Configuration(Product) = Configuration(Intermediate)`.\n6.  **Overall:** `Configuration(Product) = Configuration(B)`.\n7.  Given that the product is **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must have been **(S)**.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nBoth reactions require the same starting material.\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
