    "An analysis of the problem leads to the following conclusions:\n1.  **Identify Element Y and compound A2:**\n    Let the formula of compound A2 be YF_n. The mass percentage of fluorine (F) is given as 31.96%.\n    The molar mass of fluorine is approximately 19.00 g/mol. Let M_Y be the molar mass of element Y.\n    The formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\n    ɷF = (n × 19.00) / (M_Y + n × 19.00) = 0.3196\n    Solving for M_Y:\n    19.00n = 0.3196 * M_Y + 0.3196 * 19.00n\n    19.00n = 0.3196 * M_Y + 6.0724n\n    12.9276n = 0.3196 * M_Y\n    M_Y ≈ 40.45n\n\n    We must find an element Y and an integer n that satisfy this relationship. Let's test integer values for n:\n    *   n=1, M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca)\n    *   n=2, M_Y ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Br, Kr)\n    *   n=3, M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Sb)\n    *   n=4, M_Y ≈ 161.80 g/mol (close to Tb, Dy)\n    *   n=5, M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Bi)\n    *   n=6, M_Y ≈ 242.70 g/mol (close to Pu, Am)\n\n    To find the best fit, we can calculate the theoretical mass percentage for the most likely candidates:\n    *   For Y=Kr (Krypton, M=83.80) and n=2, A2=KrF₂. ɷF = (2×19)/(83.8+38) = 31.2%.\n    *   For Y=I (Iodine, M=126.9) and n=3, A2=IF₃. ɷF = (3×19)/(126.9+57) = 31.0%.\n    *   For Y=Pu (Plutonium, M=244) and n=6, A2=PuF₆. ɷF = (6×19)/(244+114) = 31.84%.\n\n    The closest match is for Plutonium (Pu) with n=6, making A2 = PuF₆.\n\n2.  **Verify the Plutonium Hypothesis:**\n    *   **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** Plutonium is known to form several fluorides. While PuF₃, PuF₄, and PuF₆ are the most stable, PuF₅ and other phases like Pu₂F₁₁ have been reported, satisfying this condition.\n    *   **\"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2...and fluorine.\"** This implies the reaction A1 -> A2 + F₂. Since A2 is PuF₆, A1 must be a higher fluoride of plutonium. PuF₇ and PuF₈ have been studied theoretically and are predicted to be highly unstable. The decomposition of a very unstable PuF₈ (A1) into PuF₆ (A2) and F₂ would fit this description. Also, Plutonium heptafluoride (PuF₇) is described as being intensely colored (likely red-brown), similar to other heptafluorides. So, we can identify **A1 = PuF₇** and **A2 = PuF₆**.\n    *   **\"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"** PuF₇, being an extremely strong fluorinating agent, would readily oxidize xenon.\n    *   **\"A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\"** A plausible candidate for A3 is PuF₄, which is produced by the fluorination of plutonium. PuF₄ is a powerful fluorinating agent capable of reacting with xenon. So, **A3 = PuF₄**.\n    *   **\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** \"Y\" is elemental Plutonium (Pu). This describes a comproportionation reaction. A likely reaction involving plutonium fluorides is `3PuF₄ + Pu -> 4PuF₃`. In this scenario, **A4 = PuF₄** and **A5 = PuF₃**. Note that the problem statement seems to reuse A3 and A4 for the same compound. A concentrated solution of PuF₄ would be needed for the reaction. Hot solutions of PuF₄ can be colorless depending on the concentration and complexation.\n    *   **\"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"** A5 is PuF₃. PuF₃ is poorly soluble in water, but it can react, especially with hot water or upon hydrolysis over time, to form Plutonium(III) oxyfluoride (PuOF) and hydrofluoric acid (HF). `PuF₃ + H₂O -> PuOF + 2HF`. This fits the description.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    Based on the analysis, the substance A4 is Plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF₄).\n    *   Atomic weight of Plutonium (Pu) = 244.06 g/mol (for the most stable isotope)\n    *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) = 19.00 g/mol\n    The molecular weight of A4 (PuF₄) is:\n    M(PuF₄) = 244.06 + 4 × 19.00 = 244.06 + 76.00 = 320.06 g/mol.\n\nThis value falls outside all the given ranges (A-D). This indicates there is likely a different interpretation of element Y.\n\nLet's revisit the identification of Y, but focusing on the compound numbers A1-A5 being distinct. Let's reconsider Krypton.\n\n*   Y = Kr (Krypton, M = 83.8 g/mol)\n*   A2 = KrF₂ (ɷF = 31.2%, reasonably close to 31.96%).\n*   A1: Decomposes into KrF₂ and F₂. This means A1 = KrF₄. KrF₄ -> KrF₂ + F₂. This is a known decomposition.\n*   A3: Can interact with Xenon. It is obtained by fluorinating Kr. Fluorinating Kr gives KrF₂. So, A3=KrF₂. This is inconsistent as A2 and A3 would be the same compound.\n\nLet's reconsider Iodine.\n*   Y = I (Iodine, M=126.9 g/mol)\n*   A2 = IF₃ (ɷF = 31.0%, also a reasonable fit).\n*   The known fluorides are IF, IF₃, IF₅, IF₇. A few radicals are known, so \"five binary compounds\" is plausible.\n*   A1 -> IF₃ + F₂. This means A1 could be IF₅, via the reaction 2IF₅ -> 2IF₃ + 2F₂. This is not a standard decomposition; IF₅ is stable. The decomposition A1 -> A2 + F₂ points to A1 having a higher oxidation state. So, A1=IF₅ and A2=IF₃.\n*   A3: interacts with Xe, obtained by fluorination of I. Let A3 = IF₇. It's made by fluorinating iodine and is a very strong oxidizer.\n*   A5 from A4: I + A4 -> A5. This is a comproportionation. A plausible reaction is 2I + IF₇ -> 3IF₃, but that's not a 1:1 molar ratio. Another is `I + 3IF₃ -> 3I₂ + 3HF` in aqueous solution. This doesn't fit. How about `I + IF₅ ->` ... no simple 1:1 reaction to a single product.\n\nThere appears to be a flaw or ambiguity in the problem statement, or a very specific piece of chemical knowledge is required. However, if we must choose from the given options, and if the reuse of compound A3/A4 was a mistake, the plutonium hypothesis is chemically the most consistent, despite the molecular weight of PuF₄ not fitting any range.\n\nLet's re-examine the A4 -> A5 step, assuming Y=Pu.\n`Pu + A4 -> A5` (1:1 molar ratio).\nIf A4 = PuF₄, the reaction `Pu + 3PuF₄ -> 4PuF₃` does not have a 1:1 molar ratio.\nWhat if A4 is a different fluoride? Let A4 be PuF₆.\nReaction: `2Pu + PuF₆ -> 3PuF₄`. This doesn't have a 1:1 molar ratio.\n`Pu + PuF₆ -> 2PuF₃.5` (i.e. Pu₂F₇), not a simple binary compound.\n\nGiven the inconsistencies, let's step back and assume A4 and A3 are distinct.\nY=Pu, A1=PuF₇, A2=PuF₆, A3=PuF₄, A5=PuF₃.\nWhat is A4? It is a substance in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" that reacts with Pu to give PuF₃.\nPerhaps A4 is not a fluoride of Y, but an acid? The problem states \"Five binary compounds...A1...A2...A3...A4...A5...\". This implies all are Y-F compounds. This seems to be a contradiction.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the problem and that for A4, M_Y=40.45 * 4 = 161.8, leading to element Dysprosium (Dy, M=162.5). A4=DyF₄. Molecular weight of DyF₄ = 162.5 + 4*19 = 238.5 g/mol. This is in the range **D) 220-240**.\nLet's check this hypothesis:\nY=Dy. Five fluorides? DyF₂, DyF₃, DyF₄ are known. Not five. Red substance A1 decomposing to A2? No obvious candidate. Dy does not oxidize Xe. This hypothesis fails.\n\nLet's revisit the PuF₄ MW=320. Maybe the ranges are wrong?\nLet's reconsider Iodine, where A2=IF₃. MW = 183.9. Maybe A4=A2? In that case, the MW would be in range **C) 160-180**. Let's check the reaction: `I + IF₃ -> ...` in a 1:1 ratio. No simple product.\n\nThere must be a consistent interpretation. The most likely source of error is either my interpretation or a typo in the problem. The reuse of A3 and A4 being the same compound (PuF₄) seems like a logical deduction that resolves most clues, apart from the molar ratio. If we accept PuF₄ as A4, its MW is 320.06 g/mol. None of the ranges fit.\n\nLet's re-read carefully: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nWhat if A4 is a complex? E.g., H₂[PuF₆]? But the problem says A4 is a binary compound.\nThe problem is highly ambiguous and likely contains errors.\n\nHowever, if we strictly follow the logic for Iodine:\nY=I, A2=IF₃ (MW=183.9, %F=31.0%)\nLet's assume A4 is IF₅. MW = 126.9 + 5*19 = 221.9 g/mol. This falls in range D.\nReaction: `I + IF₅ ->` ??? Does not give a simple product in 1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's assume A4 is IF₇. MW = 126.9 + 7*19 = 259.9 g/mol. Outside ranges.\nLet's assume A4 is IF₃. MW = 183.9 g/mol. This is in range C.\nLet's assume A4 is IF. MW = 126.9 + 19 = 145.9 g/mol. This is in range B.\nReaction: `I + IF -> I₂F`. This is not one of the five known binary compounds.\n\nThe puzzle is very difficult due to these inconsistencies. Let's revisit the candidates from the Python script. Pu gave the best fit for %F. Second best was Kr. Third was Au. Fourth was I. If we discard the actinides (Pu), Krypton is the next best choice but fails the \"five compounds\" test.\n\nLet's trust the %F match for Plutonium as the key, as it's the most precise data point.\nY=Pu, A2=PuF₆.\nThen A4 = PuF₄ (as A3) gives MW=320.\nLet's assume there's a mistake and A4=PuF₅. MW = 244 + 5*19 = 339.\nLet's assume A4=PuF₃. MW = 244 + 3*19 = 301.\n\nAll MWs for Plutonium fluorides are >300. The provided ranges A, B, C, D (max 240) cannot be correct if Y is Plutonium.\n\nThis means either Y is not Plutonium, or the ranges are wrong. Let's assume the ranges are correct and Y is not Pu.\nWhat element's fluoride has a MW in one of these ranges?\nRange B: 140-160. Candidate: IF (MW=145.9). Let's test A4 = IF. Then Y=I. `I + IF -> ?`. No.\nRange C: 160-180. Candidate: SbF₅ (MW=121.8 + 5*19 = 216.8). No. IF₃ (MW=183.9). Close. It is outside the range.\nRange D: 220-240. Candidate: IF₅ (MW=221.9). This fits perfectly. Let's assume A4=IF₅.\nIf A4 = IF₅, Y=I.\nDoes this work?\nY=I, A4=IF₅.\n`I + IF₅ -> ...` (1:1 ratio). Still problematic.\nA2=IF₃ (%F=31%). Plausible. A1=IF₅. `IF₅ -> IF₃ + F₂` is not a standard reaction. But `IF₇` could decompose to IF₅ and F₂.\nThis entire line of reasoning is fraught with contradictions.\n\nGiven the choices, there must be a simple solution missed. The most likely intended element is Iodine, despite the poorer fit for %F, as its chemistry is more common knowledge than Plutonium's.\nIf Y=I: The fluorides are IF, IF₃, IF₅, IF₇. MWs are ~146, 184, 222, 260.\nThese correspond to ranges B, C, D.\nLet's assume A4 = IF₃. MW = 183.9. This falls in range C.\nLet's assume A4 = IF₅. MW = 221.9. This falls in range D.\nLet's assume A4 = IF. MW = 145.9. This falls in range B.\n\nThe reaction `3 I + IF₅ -> ...` is complex. The reaction `I + IF₇ ->` is also not simple. The 1:1 ratio is the most confusing part. If we ignore it, the iodine model is plausible.\nIf A4 = IF₅, its molecular weight is 221.9 g/mol. This is within the range 220-240.\n\nLet's assume this is the intended answer.\nA4 = IF₅. MW = 221.9 g/mol.\n\n<<<D>>>"
