    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state and the introduction of the charge:** We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. When a positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an electric field within the cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction on the Cavity Surface:** The electric field lines originating from the charge $+q$ cannot pass through the conducting material, because the electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. To cancel the field from $+q$ within the conductor, a negative charge must be induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). By applying Gauss's Law to a surface just outside the cavity but within the conductor material, we find that the total induced charge on the cavity surface must be exactly $-q$. This is because the electric field is zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface, so the total enclosed charge must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge $+q$ and the charge induced on the inner wall, so $+q + q_{inner} = 0 \\implies q_{inner} = -q$.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor as a whole was initially neutral (charge = 0). After inducing a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface, a charge of $+q$ must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain overall neutrality. Since charge can only reside on the surfaces of a conductor in equilibrium, this charge $+q$ will spread out over the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields the region outside the shell from the electric fields of any charges located inside the shell. In our case, the conductor's material shields the outer surface from the electric field created by the original charge $+q$ and the induced charge $-q$ on the cavity wall. Therefore, the distribution of the $+q$ charge on the outer surface is not affected by the positions of the cavity or the charge within it.\n\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** Since the outer surface of the conductor is a perfect sphere and it is shielded from the non-symmetric charges inside, the induced charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over this outer surface.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** The electric field at a point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields from all charges. However, we can use the principle of shielding again. The net electric field at point P is the sum of the field from (a) the charge configuration inside (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$) and (b) the charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n    *   The field due to the combination of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the cavity wall is zero for all points outside the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined *only* by the uniformly distributed charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n7.  **Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** For any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to the field that would be produced by a single point charge with the same total charge, located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface = $+q$.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is the reference point.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is given as $L$.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Using the formula for the electric field of a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{(\\text{Total Charge})}{(\\text{Distance})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The extra information provided in the problem, such as the cavity radius $r$, the cavity offset $s$, the distance $l$, and the angle $\\theta$, is irrelevant to the calculation of the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the electrostatic shielding effect. The correct expression for the electric field at point P depends only on the charge $q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
