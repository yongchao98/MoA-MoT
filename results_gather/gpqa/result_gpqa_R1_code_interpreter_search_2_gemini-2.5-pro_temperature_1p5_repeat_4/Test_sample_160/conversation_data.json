    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM).\n    *   **λ1:** The mean free path (MFP) of gas molecules colliding with *other gas molecules*. This is a standard concept from the kinetic theory of gases.\n    *   **λ2:** The mean free path of *electrons* from the beam colliding (scattering) with the *gas molecules*.\n    *   **Conditions:** The number of gas molecules (and thus their number density, `n`) and the temperature are constant. The electron beam has a very high energy (1000 kV or 1 MeV).\n    *   **Question:** What is the relationship between λ2 and λ1?\n\n2.  **Formulate the Physics:**\n    *   The general formula for the mean free path of a particle 'a' moving through a collection of target particles 'b' is λ = 1 / (n_b * σ_ab), where `n_b` is the number density of the target particles and `σ_ab` is the collision cross-section.\n    *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collisions):** Both the moving particle and the target particles are gas molecules. Because all particles are in random thermal motion, a correction factor of √2 is introduced to account for the average relative velocity.\n        *   Formula: `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gg` = the kinetic collision cross-section between two gas molecules. This is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n    *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collisions):** The moving particle is an electron, and the target is a gas molecule. The electron is moving at a very high velocity (relativistic, close to the speed of light) due to the 1000 kV accelerating voltage. The thermal velocity of the gas molecules is negligible in comparison. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets.\n        *   Formula: `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules (this is the same `n` as for λ1).\n        *   `σ_eg` = the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n\n3.  **Compare the Two Mean Free Paths:**\n    *   To find the relationship between λ2 and λ1, let's take their ratio:\n        *   `λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]`\n        *   The `n` terms cancel out.\n        *   `λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas):** This represents the effective area for a collision between two molecules. It's on the order of the square of the molecular diameter (e.g., for N₂, it's roughly 4 x 10⁻¹⁹ m²). It's a measure of their \"physical size\" in a kinetic sense.\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas):** This represents the effective area for a collision (scattering event) between a very high-energy electron and a gas molecule. A 1000 keV electron is extremely energetic and penetrating. It interacts with the atom via the Coulomb force. A significant scattering event (which defines a \"collision\" in this context) requires a close approach to the atomic nucleus. Since the nucleus is incredibly small compared to the overall size of the atom, the probability of such an event is very low.\n    *   **Conclusion on Cross-Sections:** The high-energy electron \"sees\" the gas atom as a very small target. Therefore, the electron-gas scattering cross-section `σ_eg` is significantly *smaller* than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section `σ_gg`.\n        *   `σ_eg << σ_gg`\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Result:**\n    *   We have the relationship: `λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)`\n    *   We know √2 ≈ 1.414.\n    *   We deduced that the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number much larger than 1.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio `λ2 / λ1` must be a number much larger than √2 (≈1.414).\n    *   This means `λ2` is significantly larger than `λ1`.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect. The physics of the collisions is different.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect. This would imply the electron has a much larger collision cross-section, which is contrary to the physics of high-energy scattering.\n    *   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This implies λ2 is only slightly larger than λ1. Our analysis shows λ2 should be much larger. Furthermore, our lower bound for the ratio is ~1.414, which is already outside this range.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. Our analysis concluded that `λ2 / λ1` is much larger than 1.414. A value that is much larger than 1.414 is certainly greater than or equal to 1.22. This is the only option consistent with the physical reality that high-energy electrons are very penetrating and thus have a very long mean free path in a dilute gas.\n\n<<<D>>>"
