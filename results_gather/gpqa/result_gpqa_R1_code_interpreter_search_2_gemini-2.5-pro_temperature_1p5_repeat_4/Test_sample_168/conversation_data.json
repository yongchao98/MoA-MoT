    "This problem requires analyzing a nuclear decay process and its variant to compare the energy spectra of one of the products. Let's break down the analysis into two parts: the nature of the spectrum (continuous vs. discrete) and the endpoint of the spectrum.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Spectrum's Nature (Continuous vs. Discrete)\n\n*   **Original Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`\n    The total energy released (the Q-value) is shared among the kinetic energies of the final state particles: the two B nucleons, the two E particles, and the two V particles.\n    When a decay results in three or more free particles in the final state, the energy can be distributed among them in a continuous range of possibilities while still conserving total energy and momentum. The energy spectrum of any one of the products (or a subset, like the two E particles) will be continuous.\n    In this case, we have 6 particles in the final state. Even if we consider the two heavy B nucleons to recoil together, we still have at least three \"bodies\" (the 2B nucleus, the 2E pair, the 2V pair) sharing the available kinetic energy. The problem statement confirms this by stating the original spectrum is continuous.\n\n*   **Variant Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`\n    In this variant, the two V particles are replaced by a single exotic particle M. The final state now consists of two B nucleons, two E particles, and one M particle.\n    The total number of particles in the final state is 5. Since this is more than two, the Q-value of this decay will also be shared among the final particles in a continuous range of ways.\n    Therefore, the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles will remain **continuous**. The exact shape of the distribution will change because the decay dynamics (the phase space) are different, but its fundamental nature as a continuous spectrum persists.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Spectrum Nature:** The spectrum remains continuous. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Spectrum's Endpoint\n\nThe endpoint of the energy spectrum corresponds to the maximum possible kinetic energy that the particles of interest (the two E particles combined, `KE_2E`) can have. This maximum is achieved when the other final state particles carry away the minimum possible kinetic energy (which is zero).\n\n*   **Q-value Definition:** The total kinetic energy released in a decay is the Q-value, which is the difference between the total initial rest mass energy and the total final rest mass energy.\n    `Q = (Initial Rest Mass)c² - (Final Rest Mass)c²`\n\n*   **Endpoint of the Original Decay (Endpoint₁):**\n    `Q₁ = (2m_A)c² - (2m_B + 2m_E + 2m_V)c²`\n    The total kinetic energy `Q₁` is shared: `Q₁ = KE_2B + KE_2E + KE_2V`.\n    The maximum kinetic energy for the E particles, `KE_2E_max`, occurs when `KE_2B` and `KE_2V` are minimal. Assuming the heavy B nucleons have negligible recoil kinetic energy, the endpoint is determined by the case where the V particles also have zero kinetic energy.\n    `Endpoint₁ = KE_2E_max ≈ Q₁`\n\n*   **Endpoint of the Variant Decay (Endpoint₂):**\n    `Q₂ = (2m_A)c² - (2m_B + 2m_E + m_M)c²`\n    The problem states that M is a **massless** particle, so `m_M = 0`.\n    `Q₂ = (2m_A)c² - (2m_B + 2m_E)c²`\n    The total kinetic energy `Q₂` is shared: `Q₂ = KE_2B + KE_2E + KE_M`.\n    Similarly, the maximum kinetic energy for the E particles, `KE_2E_max`, occurs when `KE_2B` and `KE_M` are minimal (zero).\n    `Endpoint₂ = KE_2E_max ≈ Q₂`\n\n*   **Comparing the Endpoints:**\n    Let's compare `Q₁` and `Q₂`:\n    `Q₂ - Q₁ = [(2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E)c²] - [(2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 2m_V)c²]`\n    `Q₂ - Q₁ = 2m_V c²`\n\n    The particle V is described as a \"lighter particle,\" which implies it has a positive rest mass (`m_V > 0`). Therefore, `2m_V c²` is a positive quantity.\n    This means `Q₂ > Q₁`.\n    Since the endpoints are approximately equal to their respective Q-values, we have `Endpoint₂ > Endpoint₁`.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous because the final state of the variant decay still contains more than two particles. The endpoint of this spectrum increases because replacing two massive V particles with one massless M particle reduces the total rest mass of the final products, thus increasing the total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the decay.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
