    "Here's the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem involves distinguishing two quantum energy levels that have finite lifetimes. This directly relates to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. The principle states that the uncertainty in a state's energy (`ΔE`) and its lifetime (`Δt` or `τ`) are related by the inequality:\n    `ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`h / 2π`).\n\n2.  **Interpret the Concepts:**\n    *   A finite lifetime `τ` means the energy level is not perfectly sharp. It is \"broadened\" by an amount `ΔE`, often called the natural linewidth.\n    *   We can approximate the minimum energy width `ΔE` as:\n        `ΔE ≈ ħ / τ`\n    *   To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, E1 and E2, the difference in their energies (`|E1 - E2|`) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths (`ΔE1 + ΔE2`). If their energy difference is smaller than this sum, their energy distributions will overlap too much to be seen as distinct.\n    *   Therefore, the condition for resolvability is:\n        `|E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2`\n\n3.  **Identify Necessary Constants and Given Values:**\n    *   Reduced Planck's constant, `ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s`.\n    *   Lifetime of the first state, `τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s`.\n    *   Lifetime of the second state, `τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Widths:**\n    *   Calculate the energy width of the first state (`ΔE1`):\n        `ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV`\n    *   Calculate the energy width of the second state (`ΔE2`):\n        `ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Minimum Required Separation:**\n    *   To resolve the levels, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of their widths:\n        `|E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2`\n    *   `Sum of widths = (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)`\n    *   To make addition easier, let's express `ΔE2` in terms of 10⁻⁷: `6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV`.\n    *   `Sum of widths ≈ (6.582 + 0.6582) x 10⁻⁷ eV ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV`.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The energy difference `|E1 - E2|` must be greater than approximately `7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV`. Let's examine the given options:\n        *   A) `10⁻⁸ eV`: This is less than `7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV`. Not resolvable.\n        *   B) `10⁻⁴ eV`: This is much greater than `7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV`. **This is resolvable.**\n        *   C) `10⁻¹¹ eV`: This is much less than `7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV`. Not resolvable.\n        *   D) `10⁻⁹ eV`: This is less than `7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV`. Not resolvable.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The only energy difference large enough to allow the two energy levels to be clearly resolved is `10⁻⁴ eV`.\n\nI will now use a Python script to verify the calculation precisely.\n```python\n# The reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Given lifetimes in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy width (uncertainty) for each state using DeltaE ≈ hbar / tau\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To resolve the two levels, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their widths.\nmin_required_separation = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Sum of widths (minimum required separation): {min_required_separation:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Check which option is greater than the minimum required separation\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-8,\n    \"B\": 1e-4,\n    \"C\": 1e-11,\n    \"D\": 1e-9\n}\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Comparing with options ---\")\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    is_resolvable = \"Resolvable\" if value > min_required_separation else \"Not Resolvable\"\n    print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV): {is_resolvable}\")\n\n```\nEnergy width of state 1 (ΔE1): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy width of state 2 (ΔE2): 6.582e-08 eV\nSum of widths (minimum required separation): 7.240e-07 eV\n\n--- Comparing with options ---\nOption A (1.0e-08 eV): Not Resolvable\nOption B (1.0e-04 eV): Resolvable\nOption C (1.0e-11 eV): Not Resolvable\nOption D (1.0e-09 eV): Not Resolvable\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve the problem based on the provided thinking process and the code output.\n\n**Thinking Process Revisited:**\n\n1.  **Principle:** The core idea is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time (`ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2`). A shorter lifetime (`Δt`) leads to a larger energy uncertainty (`ΔE`), also known as level broadening or natural linewidth.\n\n2.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Lifetime `τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s`. The corresponding energy width `ΔE1` is `ħ / τ1`.\n    *   Lifetime `τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s`. The corresponding energy width `ΔE2` is `ħ / τ2`.\n    *   The code calculated these values:\n        *   `ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV`\n        *   `ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV`\n\n3.  **Resolution Condition:** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be \"clearly resolved\" or \"distinguishable,\" the difference in their energies (`|E1 - E2|`) must be larger than the sum of their individual energy widths (`ΔE1 + ΔE2`). This ensures that their broadened energy profiles do not overlap to the point of being indistinguishable.\n    *   Required energy difference > `ΔE1 + ΔE2`\n\n4.  **Final Check:**\n    *   The code calculated the minimum required separation: `ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ 7.240 x 10⁻⁷ eV`.\n    *   Now, I need to compare the given options to this minimum value:\n        *   A) `10⁻⁸ eV` is smaller than `7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV`.\n        *   B) `10⁻⁴ eV` is larger than `7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV`.\n        *   C) `10⁻¹¹ eV` is smaller than `7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV`.\n        *   D) `10⁻⁹ eV` is smaller than `7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The only option that represents an energy difference large enough for the levels to be resolved is `10⁻⁴ eV`. The code output confirms this reasoning perfectly.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer. The problem is based on the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime, its energy is not perfectly defined. This leads to an energy broadening or width (ΔE) for the energy level. The relationship is given by:\n\n`ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ`\n\nwhere:\n*   `ΔE` is the energy width of the state.\n*   `τ` is the lifetime of the state.\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, approximately `6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s`.\n\nTo be able to clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two different energy levels, `E1` and `E2`, the difference in their energies must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths. This ensures that their broadened energy profiles do not overlap significantly.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the energy width (ΔE1) for the first state.**\n*   Lifetime `τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s`\n*   `ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the energy width (ΔE2) for the second state.**\n*   Lifetime `τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s`\n*   `ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the minimum energy separation required for resolution.**\nFor the levels to be resolved, the energy difference between them must be greater than the sum of their individual widths.\n*   `Minimum Separation > ΔE1 + ΔE2`\n*   `Minimum Separation > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)`\n*   `Minimum Separation > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)`\n*   `Minimum Separation > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV`\n\n**Step 4: Compare the required separation with the given options.**\nWe are looking for an energy difference that is greater than `7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV`.\n\n*   A) `10⁻⁸ eV`: This is smaller than the required separation.\n*   B) `10⁻⁴ eV`: This is significantly larger than the required separation (`10⁻⁴ > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷`).\n*   C) `10⁻¹¹ eV`: This is smaller than the required separation.\n*   D) `10⁻⁹ eV`: This is smaller than the required separation.\n\nTherefore, an energy difference of `10⁻⁴ eV` is large enough to clearly resolve the two energy levels.\n\n<<<B>>>"
