    "Here is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Hamiltonian:**\n    The Hamiltonian is given by $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$.\n    *   $\\varepsilon$ is a constant with the dimension of energy.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n    *   $\\vec{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is an arbitrary unit vector, which means its magnitude is 1, i.e., $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Method 1: Direct Matrix Calculation**\n    First, we write out the Hamiltonian as a 2x2 matrix.\n    The Pauli matrices are:\n    $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    The dot product $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ is $n_x\\sigma_x + n_y\\sigma_y + n_z\\sigma_z$:\n    $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n} = n_x\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + n_y\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + n_z\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - in_y \\\\ n_x + in_y & -n_z \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    So, the Hamiltonian matrix is:\n    $H = \\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - in_y \\\\ n_x + in_y & -n_z \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    To find the eigenvalues ($\\lambda$), we solve the characteristic equation, $det(H - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n    $H - \\lambda I = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon n_z - \\lambda & \\varepsilon(n_x - in_y) \\\\ \\varepsilon(n_x + in_y) & -\\varepsilon n_z - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    The determinant is:\n    $det(H - \\lambda I) = (\\varepsilon n_z - \\lambda)(-\\varepsilon n_z - \\lambda) - \\varepsilon(n_x - in_y) \\cdot \\varepsilon(n_x + in_y) = 0$\n    $(-\\lambda^2 + (\\varepsilon n_z)^2) - \\varepsilon^2(n_x^2 - (in_y)^2) = 0$\n    $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2 n_z^2 - \\varepsilon^2(n_x^2 + n_y^2) = 0$\n    $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2 (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) = 0$\n\n    Since $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. Substituting this into the equation:\n    $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2 (1) = 0$\n    $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$\n    $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$\n\n3.  **Method 2: Using Properties of Pauli Matrices**\n    A more elegant approach is to use the algebraic properties of the Pauli matrices. A key property is that for any unit vector $\\vec{n}$, the square of the operator $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})$ is the identity matrix $I$.\n    Let's prove this:\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (\\sum_i n_i \\sigma_i) (\\sum_j n_j \\sigma_j) = \\sum_{i,j} n_i n_j \\sigma_i \\sigma_j$\n    Using the identity $\\sigma_i \\sigma_j = \\delta_{ij}I + i \\sum_k \\epsilon_{ijk} \\sigma_k$:\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\sum_{i,j} n_i n_j (\\delta_{ij}I) + i \\sum_{i,j,k} n_i n_j \\epsilon_{ijk} \\sigma_k$\n    The first term is $\\sum_i n_i^2 I = (n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2)I = (1)I = I$.\n    The second term's sum is related to the cross product $\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n}$, which is zero. Thus, the second term vanishes.\n    So, we have $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$.\n\n    Now consider the square of the Hamiltonian operator:\n    $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$\n\n    Let $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $H$ corresponding to an eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $H |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n    Applying $H$ again:\n    $H^2 |\\psi\\rangle = H (\\lambda |\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda (H |\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda (\\lambda |\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda^2 |\\psi\\rangle$\n    From our previous result, we also have:\n    $H^2 |\\psi\\rangle = (\\varepsilon^2 I) |\\psi\\rangle = \\varepsilon^2 |\\psi\\rangle$\n    Equating the two expressions, we get:\n    $\\lambda^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\varepsilon^2 |\\psi\\rangle$\n    Since $|\\psi\\rangle$ is not the zero vector, we must have:\n    $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$, which gives the eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n4.  **Method 3: Dimensional Analysis**\n    The Hamiltonian $H$ represents energy, so its eigenvalues must have dimensions of energy.\n    *   $\\varepsilon$ is given to have dimensions of energy [E].\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma}$ and $\\vec{n}$ are dimensionless.\n    *   $\\hbar$ (Planck's constant) has dimensions of action [E·T].\n    Let's check the dimensions of the given options:\n    A) $\\pm \\varepsilon$: Has dimension [E]. This is physically correct.\n    B) $\\pm 1$: Dimensionless. Incorrect.\n    C) $\\pm \\varepsilon \\hbar/2$: Has dimension [E] * [E·T] = [E²·T]. Incorrect.\n    D) $\\pm \\hbar/2$: Has dimension [E·T]. Incorrect.\n\n    Dimensional analysis alone points to option A as the only possible answer.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    All three methods—direct matrix calculation, operator algebra, and dimensional analysis—consistently lead to the same result. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\nFinal Answer corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
