    "This problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) produced by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The derivation of these potentials is a standard topic in classical electromagnetism.\n\n**1. Define the System and Coordinates:**\n*   A point charge `q`.\n*   The trajectory of the charge is given by the vector function `s(t)`.\n*   The velocity of the charge at any time `t'` is `v(t') = d s(t') / dt'`.\n*   The field is observed at a position `r` and time `t`.\n*   Due to the finite speed of light `c`, the field observed at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the retarded time `tr`.\n*   The position of the charge at the retarded time is `s(tr)`.\n*   The retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position `s(tr)` to the observation point `r` is `t - tr`.\n    *   Distance = `|r - s(tr)|`\n    *   Time = Distance / speed\n    *   `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n\n**2. Problem Notation:**\nLet's align the problem's notation with the standard definitions:\n*   The vector from the point where the field was generated (`s(tr)`) to the observation point (`r`) is `d = r - s(tr)`.\n*   The magnitude of this vector is `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr` is `v = v(tr)`.\n*   With this notation, the retarded time condition becomes `t - tr = d / c`.\n\n**3. The Retarded Potentials:**\nThe general expressions for the potentials in terms of charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are the retarded potentials:\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πεo) ∫ [ρ(r', tr)] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μo / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr)] / |r - r'| d³r'`\nwhere `tr = t - |r - r'| / c`.\n\nFor a point charge `q` at `s(t')`, the densities are:\n*   `ρ(r', t') = q * δ(r' - s(t'))`\n*   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas and performing the integration (which is non-trivial because `tr` depends on the integration variable `r'`) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n**4. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:**\nThe result of this standard derivation is:\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πεo) * [q / (d - d · v / c)]_tr`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μo / 4π) * [q * v / (d - d · v / c)]_tr`\n\nThe subscript `_tr` indicates that all quantities inside the brackets (`d`, `d`, and `v`) must be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n**5. Matching with the Options:**\nLet's manipulate the expressions to match the format given in the multiple-choice options.\nThe denominator is `d - d · v / c`. We can rewrite this by finding a common denominator `c`:\n`d - d · v / c = (dc - d · v) / c`\n\nSubstitute this back into the potential expressions:\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πεo) * [q / ((dc - d · v) / c)] = qc / (4πεo (dc - d · v))`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μo / 4π) * [q v / ((dc - d · v) / c)] = μo qc v / (4π (dc - d · v))`\n\nNow, let's compare these derived formulas with the given options:\n*   A) `V(...) = qc / (4πεo (dc + d · v))`, `A(...) = ...` — Incorrect, the sign in the denominator is wrong.\n*   B) `V(...) = q / (4πεo r)` — Incorrect, this is the static potential, not for a moving charge.\n*   C) `V(...) = q / (4πεo r)` — Incorrect, same reason as B.\n*   D) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πεo (dc - d · v))`, `A(r,t) = μo qc v / (4π (dc - d · v))` — This exactly matches our derived expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n**6. Relationship between A and V:**\nAs a further check, there is a simple relationship between `V` and `A` for a moving point charge.\nFrom the expressions in option D:\n`A(r,t) = (μo qc v) / (4π (dc - d · v))`\n`V(r,t) = (qc) / (4πεo (dc - d · v))`\n\nIf we take the ratio `A / V`:\n`A / V = [μo qc v / (4π (dc - d · v))] / [qc / (4πεo (dc - d · v))]`\n`A / V = (μo qc v / 4π) * (4πεo / qc) = μo εo v`\nUsing the fundamental relation `c² = 1 / (μo εo)`, we get:\n`A / V = v / c²`\n`A(r,t) = (v / c²) V(r,t)`\n\nThis confirms that the two expressions given in option D are consistent with each other.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
