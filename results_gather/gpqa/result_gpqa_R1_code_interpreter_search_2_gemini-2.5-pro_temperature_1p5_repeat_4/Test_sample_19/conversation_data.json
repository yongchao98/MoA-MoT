    "This question asks for the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in the context of many-body nuclear physics. The core idea of this approximation is to simplify a complex interaction with a nucleus, which contains many nucleons (protons and neutrons), by treating it as an interaction with a single, free nucleon. Let's analyze each assumption:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is a foundational assumption. The total interaction is assumed to be the sum of interactions with each individual nucleon. It neglects more complex interactions, such as those involving meson exchange currents (where the probe interacts with the virtual particles exchanged between nucleons) or multi-nucleon correlations. By limiting the interaction to single nucleons, we can single out one nucleon as the target of the interaction. This is often referred to as the single-nucleon or one-body current approximation, and it is a prerequisite for the impulse approximation.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This assumption addresses the journey of the projectile and the ejectile. It posits that the incoming probe (e.g., an electron, neutrino) reaches the target nucleon without being scattered by any other nucleons on its way in. Similarly, it assumes that the particle(s) exiting after the interaction do not re-interact with the other \"spectator\" nucleons on their way out. This neglect of initial- and final-state interactions (FSI) allows the incoming and outgoing particles to be described by simple plane waves, which is why the full name for this approximation is often the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA). Without this assumption, the \"free\" nucleon picture is compromised because the surrounding nuclear medium affects the interaction.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This assumption concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation is a framework for describing the nucleon's behavior *within the nucleus* during a high-energy interaction. It simplifies the nucleon's relationship with its neighbors, not its own internal dynamics. Whether the quarks inside the nucleon are treated as relativistic or non-relativistic is a separate modeling choice related to nucleon form factors and structure functions. The impulse approximation can be applied in both relativistic and non-relativistic treatments of the *nucleon*. Therefore, this assumption is not a core component of the impulse approximation itself.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the very essence of the \"impulse\" in the approximation's name. It assumes the interaction happens over a very short timescale, like a sudden strike or impulse. During this brief moment, the relatively slow-acting strong nuclear forces that bind the nucleon to the nucleus are considered negligible. The nucleon is effectively \"knocked out\" so quickly that it doesn't have time to interact with its neighbors. It is treated as a free particle, with its initial momentum being its momentum within the nucleus (Fermi motion), but its binding energy is ignored during the scattering process itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe impulse approximation is fundamentally defined by treating the interaction as a rapid collision with a single nucleon that is not influenced by its nuclear environment during the event. This requires:\n-   Singling out one nucleon for the interaction (Assumption 1).\n-   Ignoring the influence of the surrounding nucleons on the projectile and ejectile (Assumption 2).\n-   Ignoring the nucleon's binding to the nucleus during the brief interaction (Assumption 4).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
