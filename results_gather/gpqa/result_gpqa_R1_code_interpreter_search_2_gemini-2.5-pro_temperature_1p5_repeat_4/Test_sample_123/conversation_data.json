    "This problem involves the concept of time dilation in special relativity and radioactive decay.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics:**\n\n*   **Radioactive Decay:** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t_proper` in their own rest frame is given by the formula:\n    N(t_proper) = N₀ * exp(-t_proper / τ)\n    where τ (tau) is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the laboratory (the detector), the particle's internal clock runs slower. The time `t_lab` measured in the lab is related to the proper time `t_proper` experienced by the particle by the Lorentz factor γ (gamma):\n    t_lab = γ * t_proper\n\n*   **Particle's Journey:** The particles travel a distance `L` (the detector radius) at a speed `v`. Since they are ultra-relativistic, their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time this takes in the lab frame is:\n    t_lab = L / v ≈ L / c\n\n**2. Formulate Equations for Both Scenarios:**\n\nWe can combine the equations. The fraction of particles surviving after traveling a distance L in the lab is:\nN/N₀ = exp(-t_proper / τ) = exp(-(t_lab / γ) / τ) = exp(-L / (c * γ * τ))\n\nLet's define a constant `K = L / (c * τ)`. This constant depends on the detector size and the particle's intrinsic lifetime, so it's the same in both scenarios.\nThe equation simplifies to:\nN/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, N/N₀ = 1/3\n*   Plugging these values into the equation:\n    1/3 = exp(-K / 20)\n*   To solve for K, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -K / 20\n    -ln(3) = -K / 20\n    K = 20 * ln(3)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, N/N₀ = 2/3\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂.\n*   Plugging these values into the equation:\n    2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)\n*   Again, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂\n    -ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂\n    γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)\n\n**3. Solve for the new Lorentz factor (γ₂):**\n\nNow we substitute the expression for `K` from Scenario 1 into the equation for γ₂ from Scenario 2:\nγ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n\nTo get a numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the result based on the derived formula\n# gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\ngamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n```output\n54.18844893322143\n```\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19. This is very close to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The relationship between the fraction of particles surviving (N/N₀), the Lorentz factor (γ), and the proper lifetime (τ) is given by:\nN/N₀ = exp(-L / (v * γ * τ))\nSince the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The equation becomes:\nN/N₀ = exp(-L / (c * γ * τ))\n\nLet's define a constant `k = L / (c * τ)`. This constant depends on the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime, so it's the same for both scenarios. The equation simplifies to:\nN/N₀ = exp(-k / γ)\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Fraction surviving, N/N₀ = 1/3\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n\nPlugging these values in:\n1/3 = exp(-k / 20)\n\nTo solve for k, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -k / 20\n-ln(3) = -k / 20\nk = 20 * ln(3)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction surviving, N/N₀ = 2/3\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂.\n\nPlugging these values in:\n2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -k / γ₂\nln(2) - ln(3) = -k / γ₂\n- (ln(3) - ln(2)) = -k / γ₂\n-ln(3/2) = -k / γ₂\nln(1.5) = k / γ₂\nγ₂ = k / ln(1.5)\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nNow, substitute the value of `k` from Scenario 1 into the equation for γ₂:\nγ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)\n\nThe code execution provides the numerical value for this expression:\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 68\nB) 54\nC) 40\nD) 28\n\nThe calculated value of ~54.2 is closest to 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
