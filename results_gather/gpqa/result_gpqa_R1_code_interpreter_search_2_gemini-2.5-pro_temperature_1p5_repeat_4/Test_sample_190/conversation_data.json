    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH and then benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting compound is a cyclohexanone with two key functional groups: a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) and a ketone (C=O). It also has a C=C double bond in the isopropenyl group.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **Sodium hydride (NaH):** A strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the hydroxyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n        *   R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **Benzyl bromide (BnBr or PhCH₂Br):** An alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** The resulting alkoxide is a nucleophile and will react with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (an Sₙ2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether. This step serves to protect the alcohol group.\n    *   R-CH₂O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyloxy group (-OBn). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged. The structure of **Product 1** is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and an acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard procedure for forming a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The ketone's carbonyl group reacts with the primary amine of the hydrazide in a condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water.\n    *   R₂C=O + H₂N-NH-Ts → R₂C=N-NH-Ts + H₂O\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group at the C1 position of the cyclohexanone ring is converted to a tosylhydrazone group. The structure of **Product 2** is the **tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (a very strong base) and an aqueous quench.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi).\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the acidic N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates a proton on a carbon α to the C=N bond. There are two such carbons, C2 and C6. Deprotonation will occur at the less sterically hindered position. The C3 position has a bulky benzyloxymethyl substituent, which hinders access to the proton on C2. Therefore, deprotonation occurs at C6.\n    3.  The resulting dianion spontaneously collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the lithium p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻Li⁺) to form a vinyllithium intermediate with a double bond between C1 and C6.\n    4.  The final step, adding aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl), quenches the reaction and protonates the vinyllithium species.\n*   **Product 3:** The overall result of the Shapiro reaction is the conversion of the ketone into an alkene, with the double bond located between the former carbonyl carbon (C1) and the less substituted α-carbon (C6). The structure of **Product 3** is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds in the molecule will be reduced to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be saturated. This converts the cyclohexene ring to a cyclohexane ring and the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The Pd/C catalyst with H₂ is also a standard reagent for the cleavage (hydrogenolysis) of benzyl ethers. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken, and the alcohol is regenerated.\n        *   R-CH₂-O-Bn + H₂ → R-CH₂-OH + Toluene (PhCH₃)\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group at one position and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) at another, with a 1,3-relationship between them. The IUPAC name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options against the derived structure of Product 4, (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This retains the tosylhydrazide group.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - **Correct.** This matches the structure derived from the reaction sequence. It has a cyclohexane ring, an isopropyl group, and a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This implies the benzyl ether protecting group was not removed, which is unlikely under these hydrogenation conditions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
