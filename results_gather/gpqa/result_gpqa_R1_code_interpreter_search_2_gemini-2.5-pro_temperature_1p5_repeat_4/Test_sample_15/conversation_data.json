    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically means the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(CH₃)=CHCl.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that is co-planar with the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name specifies the absolute configuration at several stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and the geometry of a double bond (E).\n    *   This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer. The complex, non-symmetrical structure and the given specific configurations (R and S) confirm that this is a chiral molecule.\n    *   A pure sample of a single enantiomer is optically active.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   The stereoisomer with the (2R, 3S) configuration has a plane of symmetry passing between the C2 and C3 atoms.\n    *   A compound with chiral centers but also a plane of symmetry is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R, 3R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer, and they are non-superimposable.\n    *   Therefore, this specific enantiomer is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure has a chiral center at C1, which is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH₂-CH= (C2-C3), and -CH₂-CH=CH- (C6-C5-C4).\n    *   The name specifies a single enantiomer with the (R) configuration. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This nomenclature typically indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   In a chair conformation, whether the OH groups are all axial or all equatorial, the molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through any C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond.\n    *   Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The IUPAC name corresponds to the structure: (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The only potential candidate is C3 of the butan-1-one chain. However, C3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl group, and two identical methyl groups (-CH₃). Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule can adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would pass through the C=O group and bisect both the cyclopentyl ring and the two methyl groups at the end of the chain.\n    *   Thus, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the number of optically active compounds:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
