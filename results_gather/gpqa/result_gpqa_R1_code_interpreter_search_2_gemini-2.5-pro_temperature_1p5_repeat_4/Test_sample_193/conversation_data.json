    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the partition function Z for a system of three spins S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of either +1 or -1. The total number of possible states for the system is 2^3 = 8.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\nZ = Σ_{all states} e^(-βE)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible states. The states are defined by the combinations of (S1, S2, S3).\n\n1.  **State 1: (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)**\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n2.  **State 2: (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)**\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n3.  **States with two spins +1 and one spin -1:** There are three such combinations:\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\n4.  **States with one spin +1 and two spins -1:** There are three such combinations:\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\nNow, we group the states by their energy levels to find the degeneracy of each level.\n\n*   **Energy Level 1 (E1):** E1 = -3J\n    *   The states are (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The number of states (degeneracy) for this energy level is g1 = 2.\n    *   The contribution to the partition function from this level is 2 * e^(-βE1) = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2 * e^(3Jβ).\n\n*   **Energy Level 2 (E2):** E2 = J\n    *   There are 6 states with this energy (the three states with two +1 spins and the three states with two -1 spins).\n    *   The number of states (degeneracy) for this energy level is g2 = 6.\n    *   The contribution to the partition function from this level is 6 * e^(-βE2) = 6 * e^(-βJ) = 6 * e^(-Jβ).\n\nThe total partition function Z is the sum of the contributions from all energy levels:\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
