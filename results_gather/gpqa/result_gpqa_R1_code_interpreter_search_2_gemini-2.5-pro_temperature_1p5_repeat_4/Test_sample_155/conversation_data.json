    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA is an epoxidation. This is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond.\n        *   When a trans-alkene undergoes a *syn*-addition that creates two chiral centers, the result is a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides. For (E)-oct-4-ene, this yields a 1:1 mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    3.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The epoxide is treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is a ring-opening reaction where a water molecule acts as a nucleophile. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (anti) attack by water on one of the epoxide carbons. This results in an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the original alkene.\n        *   Let's consider the hydrolysis of each enantiomer from the first step:\n            *   Hydrolysis of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane: The anti-attack of water at C4 leads to inversion of configuration at C4 (R -> S), resulting in (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 leads to inversion at C5 (R -> S), resulting in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Both (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) represent the same molecule, which is a *meso* compound (it has an internal plane of symmetry).\n            *   Hydrolysis of (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane: Similarly, anti-attack by water at either carbon also produces the same *meso* compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    4.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The sole product of Reaction 1 is the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** Again, this is a *syn*-addition.\n        *   When a cis-alkene undergoes a *syn*-addition, the product is a *meso* epoxide. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, this yields the achiral meso-compound, (cis)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    3.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The meso-epoxide undergoes acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, which is an *anti*-addition of two -OH groups.\n        *   When a meso-epoxide undergoes *anti*-opening, the result is a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric diols. The attack of water on the two epoxide carbons of the meso-intermediate are equally probable and lead to a pair of enantiomers.\n    4.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture (1:1 ratio) of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture:**\n    *   The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  **Meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1). Let's call this **M**.\n        2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2). Let's call this **R**.\n        3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2). Let's call this **S**.\n    *   The relationship between these isomers is that **R** and **S** are a pair of enantiomers, and **M** is a diastereomer to both **R** and **S**.\n\n*   **HPLC Chromatography Analysis:**\n    1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n        *   Enantiomers (like **R** and **S**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n        *   Diastereomers (like **M** vs. **R** or **S**) have different physical properties. Thus, **M** will have a different retention time from the **R/S** pair.\n        *   Conclusion: The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound (**M**) and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair (**R** + **S**).\n\n    2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n        *   The enantiomers **R** and **S** will have different interactions with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n        *   The meso compound **M**, being a diastereomer of **R** and **S**, will also have a distinct interaction with the column and will elute as a third, separate peak.\n        *   Conclusion: The chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**: one for **M**, one for **R**, and one for **S**.\n\n*   **Final Summary:**\n    *   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n    *   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
