    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the concept of density:** Density is defined as mass divided by volume (ρ = M/V). For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each option based on physical principles:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline, a planet identical to Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's call this density ρ_E.\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given directly. It is ~5.5 g/cm³, which is nearly identical to Earth's density.\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This is the key option. \"Same composition\" means it's made of the same materials as Earth (e.g., iron, silicates). However, a planet that is 5 times more massive will have much stronger gravity. This immense gravitational force compresses the planet's material, squeezing the atoms closer together. This effect, known as **gravitational self-compression**, leads to a higher overall density. Therefore, this planet's density will be significantly greater than Earth's density (> 5.51 g/cm³).\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This is the opposite of case (c). With the same composition but less mass, the gravitational compression will be weaker than Earth's. The materials will be less compressed, resulting in a lower overall density compared to Earth (< 5.51 g/cm³).\n\n3.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   Density of (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density of (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density of (c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to higher mass and compression)\n    *   Density of (d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to lower mass and compression)\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the options, the planet in option (c) is the only one guaranteed to have a density greater than Earth's. The other options have densities less than or approximately equal to Earth's. Therefore, the planet with 5 Earth masses and the same composition as Earth will have the highest density.\n\nLet's use a common mass-radius relationship for rocky planets, R ∝ M^0.27, to quantify this.\nDensity (ρ) is proportional to M/R³.\nρ ∝ M / (M^0.27)³ = M / M^0.81 = M^0.19.\nThis shows that density increases with mass.\n\n*   For planet (c), Mass = 5 M_E. Density_c ∝ (5 M_E)^0.19 ≈ 1.38 * Density_E.\n*   For planet (d), Mass = 0.5 M_E. Density_d ∝ (0.5 M_E)^0.19 ≈ 0.87 * Density_E.\n\nSo, the densities rank as: c > a ≈ b > d.\n\nThe highest density belongs to option (c).\n\n<<<C>>>"
