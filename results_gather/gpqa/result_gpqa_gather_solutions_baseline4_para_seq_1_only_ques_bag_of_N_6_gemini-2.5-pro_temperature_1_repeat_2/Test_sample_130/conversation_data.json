This anhydride has a very simple NMR spectrum: a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The single ¹H peak at 7 ppm suggests two chemically equivalent protons on a double bond (vinylic protons). The downfield shift is due to electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   The two ¹³C peaks correspond to the two types of carbons: the vinylic carbons (C=C, ~137 ppm) and the carbonyl carbons (C=O, ~165 ppm).\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent.\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene locked in the necessary *s-cis* conformation for a Diels-Alder reaction. The protons on this molecule are the two on the CH₂ group and the twelve on the four methyl groups.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition, a **Diels-Alder reaction**, between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   Like most Diels-Alder reactions, this one produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **endo rule** states that for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the major product is the *endo* isomer. In this isomer, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed bicyclic system. In this case, it's the C=C double bond bridge from the original diene. More simply, the anhydride is \"tucked under\" the diene's original π system.\n    *   The minor product is the more thermodynamically stable *exo* isomer, where the anhydride part is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side).\n    *   Therefore: **Major Product = Endo Adduct**, **Minor Product = Exo Adduct**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and Predict NOESY Cross-Peaks**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially close protons.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n\n    Let's analyze the proton proximities in both isomers:\n    *   **Proton Groups in the Product:**\n        *   **H_fused**: The two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring is fused. These came from the dienophile. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent.\n        *   **Me_vinyl**: The two methyl groups on the double bond (at positions C2 and C3 of the bicyclo[2.2.1] system). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent.\n        *   **Me_bridgehead**: The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent.\n        *   **CH₂_bridge**: The two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic and not equivalent.\n\n    *   **In the Endo (Major) Product:** The anhydride ring is tucked under the C2=C3 double bond. This brings the **H_fused** protons very close to the **Me_vinyl** groups. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them. The H_fused protons are far from the CH₂_bridge protons.\n\n    *   **In the Exo (Minor) Product:** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond and towards the C7 CH₂ bridge. This brings the **H_fused** protons very close to the **CH₂_bridge** protons. An NOE cross-peak is expected between them. The H_fused protons are now far from the Me_vinyl groups.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** The NOE cross-peak between **H_fused** and **Me_vinyl** is unique to the major (*endo*) product, and it will be absent (or very weak) in the minor (*exo*) product. This matches the description in the question.\n\n4.  **Assign NMR Signals and Identify the Correct Option**\n    *   Now we need to assign the proton groups to the chemical shifts and multiplicities given in the options.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**: This corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups on saturated sp³ carbons, which are the **Me_bridgehead** groups.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: This corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups on a C=C double bond, which are the **Me_vinyl** groups. Their shift is downfield from the other methyls due to the double bond's anisotropy.\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This corresponds to the two equivalent **H_fused** protons. They are alpha to two carbonyl groups, which strongly deshields them, justifying the ~3.5 ppm shift. Their equivalence leads to a singlet.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic **CH₂_bridge** protons.\n\n    *   The NOE cross-peak unique to the major product is between **H_fused** and **Me_vinyl**.\n    *   Based on our assignments, this is a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - **This matches our conclusion.**\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) - These are not uniquely close in the endo isomer.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (CH₂_bridge) - These are reasonably close in both isomers.\n        *   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (CH₂_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_fused) - This cross-peak is characteristic of the *minor (exo)* product, not the major one.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the resonances of the vinylic methyl groups and the protons on the fused anhydride ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid.\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent protons in the alkene region. The high chemical shift is due to deshielding by two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon, C=O). The presence of only two peaks confirms a highly symmetrical structure.\n    *   These spectral data perfectly match **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinyl protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, which aligns with the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   **Product Formula:** The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Major vs. Minor Product):**\n    *   The Alder-endo rule generally predicts that the *endo* adduct is the major kinetic product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   However, the diene in this reaction is highly sterically hindered by four methyl groups. In the transition state leading to the *endo* product, the methyl groups on the diene (specifically at the C1 and C4 positions) would severely clash with the anhydride ring of the dienophile.\n    *   To avoid this steric clash, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the *exo* transition state.\n    *   Therefore, in this specific case, the usual outcome is reversed:\n        *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n        *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n**3. Analyze the NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   **NOESY Principle:** Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), even if they are not connected by chemical bonds.\n*   **The Discriminating Cross-Peak:** The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product (*exo* adduct) but absent or weak in the minor product (*endo* adduct). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* structure but far apart in the *endo* structure.\n\n**4. Compare the *Exo* and *Endo* Structures**\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene products.\n*   Let **H_a** be the two equivalent protons originating from maleic anhydride. They are attached to the carbons of the former dienophile double bond.\n*   Let **H_b** be the two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge (the former CH₂ group of the cyclopentadiene).\n\n*   ***Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. This forces the two **H_a** protons into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they point \"up\" towards the C7 bridge. One of the bridge protons, **H_b(syn)**, also points towards the C2=C3 double bond. The proximity between **H_a** and **H_b(syn)** is very short. **A strong NOE is expected between H_a and H_b(syn).**\n\n*   ***Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 bridge. This forces the two **H_a** protons into the *exo* position, where they point \"down\" and away from the C7 bridge. The distance between **H_a** and the **H_b** protons is large. **No significant NOE is expected.**\n\nThis analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation: the cross-peak is present in the major (*exo*) product and absent in the minor (*endo*) product. Thus, the cross-peak connects protons **H_a** and **H_b(syn)**.\n\n**5. Assign NMR Signals to Protons**\n\nNow we match these protons to the signals described in the options.\n\n*   **H_a protons:** These are two equivalent protons on sp³ carbons that are alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained ring. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is very reasonable. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n*   **H_b protons:** These are the two protons on the C7 bridge. They are typically found in the 1-2 ppm range. The question describes one of them (the one giving the NOE) as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This chemical shift is appropriate, and the \"doublet\" description refers to its geminal coupling with the other C7 proton.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak connects the signal for the **H_a** protons (the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) with the signal for the **H_b(syn)** proton (the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm).\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Incorrect: This implies an interaction between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyls, which is not the unique interaction distinguishing the isomers).\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Correct)**\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Incorrect: Interaction between methyl groups, present in both isomers).\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Incorrect: Interaction between bridgehead methyls and a C7 proton, present in both isomers).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its ¹³C spectrum.\n    *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride. Due to the molecule's symmetry (a C₂v symmetry plane), the two alkene protons are chemically equivalent. This would result in a single peak (a singlet) in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is appropriate for vinylic protons attached to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   Similarly, the two alkene carbons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent. This leads to two signals in the ¹³C NMR spectrum. The chemical shift of ~137 ppm is in the alkene region (C=C), and ~165 ppm is in the carbonyl region (C=O).\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction typically produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* product and the *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product is formed when the dienophile approaches the diene such that its electron-withdrawing groups (the anhydride part) are tucked \"under\" the forming cyclohexene ring, pointing towards the diene's π-system. The endo product is usually the kinetically favored product, meaning it is formed faster and is typically the **major product**.\n    *   The *exo* product is formed when the electron-withdrawing groups point \"away\" from the π-system. The exo product is usually more thermodynamically stable but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n*   The products are bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivatives. The major product is the *endo* adduct, and the minor product is the *exo* adduct. The molecular formula of the products is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (from C₉H₁₄ diene + C₄H₂O₃ anhydride), which matches the problem statement.\n\n**3. Analyze the Structure and Predicted NMR Signals of the Products**\n\nLet's visualize the structure of the product, 1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n\nThere are four distinct sets of protons that will appear as singlets due to the molecule's symmetry:\n*   **Anhydride Protons (Ha):** The two protons on the carbons originating from maleic anhydride (C2 and C3). They are equivalent. These are methine protons adjacent to carbonyl groups. Expected chemical shift: ~3-4 ppm. The problem provides a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Vinylic Methyl Protons (Hb):** The two methyl groups attached to the double bond (at C5 and C6). They are equivalent. Expected chemical shift for vinylic methyls: ~1.5-2.0 ppm. The problem provides a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (Hd):** The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). They are equivalent. Expected chemical shift for saturated methyl groups on a quaternary carbon: ~1.0-1.5 ppm. The problem provides a **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n*   **Bridge Methylene Protons (Hc):** The two protons of the CH₂ bridge at C7. These are not relevant to the options involving only singlets.\n\n**4. Use NOESY Spectroscopy to Differentiate the Products**\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak appears between the signals of two protons if they are spatially close.\n\nThe problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons whose spatial distance changes significantly between the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n*   **In the Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride ring is *syn* (on the same face) to the C5=C6 double bond. This means the anhydride protons (**Ha**, ~3.5 ppm) are located on the same side of the molecule as the vinylic methyl groups (**Hb**, ~1.7 ppm). They are close in space. **Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between Ha and Hb is expected.**\n\n*   **In the Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite face) to the C5=C6 double bond. This means the anhydride protons (**Ha**, ~3.5 ppm) are far away from the vinylic methyl groups (**Hb**, ~1.7 ppm). **Therefore, the NOE cross-peak between Ha and Hb should be absent or very weak.**\n\nThis exactly matches the description in the problem. The cross-peak that differentiates the major and minor products is the one connecting the anhydride protons (Ha) and the vinylic methyl protons (Hb).\n\n**5. Match the Analysis to the Options**\n\n*   The cross-peak connects the resonance for the anhydride protons (**Ha**: 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and the resonance for the vinylic methyl protons (**Hb**: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm).\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect signal description.\n*   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect signal description.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This matches our identified protons Hb and Ha.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This corresponds to the bridgehead methyls (Hd) and vinylic methyls (Hb). While an NOE might exist, it wouldn't be the key differentiating peak as their relative distance doesn't change as dramatically as the Ha-Hb distance between the two isomers.\n\nThus, the cross-peak present in the major product's spectrum connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which upon dehydration forms an anhydride. This is the classic reaction of maleic acid to form maleic anhydride.\n    *   Maleic acid: *cis*-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH\n    *   Dehydration (-H₂O) → Maleic anhydride: A five-membered ring containing O-C(=O)-CH=CH-C(=O)-.\n*   **NMR Data of the Anhydride:**\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This corresponds to the two chemically equivalent vinylic protons (CH=CH), confirming the symmetry of maleic anhydride.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks. One for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) at ~165 ppm and one for the two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C) at ~137 ppm. This confirms the structure is maleic anhydride.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a substituted diene. The cyclopentadiene ring has methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. The C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n**2. Predict the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction produces a bicyclic adduct. Because the dienophile (maleic anhydride) can approach the plane of the diene from two different faces, two stereoisomeric products can be formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   **The Endo Rule:** For Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the major product because it is formed faster (kinetically favored). The *exo* product is the minor product.\n*   **Structure of the Products:** The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride portion of the molecule is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C=C double bond bridge of the bicycloheptene system.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride portion is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C=C double bond bridge.\n\n**3. Analyze the Expected ¹H NMR Spectra of the Products**\n\n*   Both the *endo* and *exo* products possess a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=C bond and the ether oxygen of the anhydride. This simplifies the NMR spectra.\n*   We can identify four main types of protons in the products:\n    1.  **Alpha-protons (Hα):** The two protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. Based on their chemical environment (alpha to a carbonyl, in a strained ring), a chemical shift around **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable.\n    2.  **Vinylic Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. They are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Methyl groups on a double bond typically resonate around **~1.7 ppm**.\n    3.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups attached to the bridgehead carbons (the carbons where the rings are fused). They are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. These are on sp³ carbons and should be more shielded (at a lower ppm) than the vinylic methyls, likely around **~1.0 ppm**.\n    4.  **Bridge Methylene Protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ group that forms the one-carbon bridge. These two protons are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic) and would typically give rise to two separate signals, each coupled to the other. The question mentions a \"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\", which likely corresponds to one of these protons.\n\n**4. Use NOESY Data to Distinguish Between Major and Minor Products**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are bonded.\n*   The question states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**. We need to find a pair of protons whose spatial proximity is significantly different in the *endo* vs. the *exo* isomer.\n*   **In the *endo* isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is folded *under* the C=C bridge. This brings the alpha-protons (Hα, ~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) which are part of that C=C bridge. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between these two groups.\n*   **In the *exo* isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring is folded *away* from the C=C bridge. The alpha-protons (Hα) and the vinylic methyl groups are now far apart. Therefore, the NOE cross-peak between them would be absent or very weak.\n\n**5. Match the Finding with the Given Options**\n\n*   The key differentiating NOE interaction connects the alpha-protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n*   Alpha-protons signal: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   Vinylic methyl protons signal: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n*   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the resonances at ~1.7 ppm and ~3.5 ppm.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This is an interaction between a bridge proton and the alpha-protons. This interaction likely exists in both isomers, although the specific protons involved might differ. It's not the clearest differentiating peak.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: This is between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. They are too far apart for a significant NOE in either isomer.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This corresponds to the interaction between the vinylic methyl protons and the alpha-protons. As determined above, this interaction is strong in the *endo* (major) product and weak/absent in the *exo* (minor) product. This is the correct answer.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: This is between the bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton. They are relatively close in both isomers, so an NOE would be expected in both.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   The first reactant is a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which is dehydrated to an anhydride. This is the classic preparation of maleic anhydride from maleic acid. The 1H NMR (one peak at 7 ppm for two equivalent vinyl protons) and 13C NMR (two peaks for two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons) confirm the symmetric structure of **maleic anhydride**. This is our dienophile.\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is our diene.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring, resulting in a bicyclic adduct.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** Generally, the *endo* product is the kinetically favored (major) product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance Exception:** However, in this specific case, the diene has four bulky methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene sterically hinder the approach of the anhydride in the *endo* orientation. This steric clash is so significant that it overrides the electronic preference for the *endo* product. Therefore, the **exo adduct is the major product**, and the *endo* adduct is the minor product. This is a well-known exception to the endo rule.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures for NOESY Correlations:**\n    *   The NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two protons that are spatially close.\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* adduct (major) but far apart in the *endo* adduct (minor).\n\n    *   Let's visualize the key protons in both isomers:\n        *   **Hb:** The two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule.\n        *   **Me-A:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (vinylic methyls).\n        *   **Me-B:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons.\n\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the newly formed C=C double bond bridge. This geometry brings the anhydride protons (**Hb**) close to the vinylic methyl groups (**Me-A**). Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between Hb and Me-A is expected.\n\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the C=C double bond bridge. This geometry places the anhydride protons (**Hb**) far away from the vinylic methyl groups (**Me-A**). No significant NOE cross-peak between Hb and Me-A is expected.\n\n    *   This perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem. The cross-peak that distinguishes the major product from the minor product is the one between **Hb** and **Me-A**.\n\n5.  **Assign the 1H NMR Signals:**\n    *   We need to match the proton types (Hb and Me-A) to the signals given in the options. Based on typical chemical shifts:\n        *   **Hb:** These are two equivalent protons on sp3-hybridized carbons that are alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained bicyclic system. Their signal will be a **2H singlet** (due to a plane of symmetry) at a relatively downfield position, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Me-A:** These are six protons from two equivalent methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinylic methyls). Their signal will be a **6H singlet** at around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Me-B:** These are six protons from two equivalent methyl groups on saturated bridgehead carbons. They would be the most upfield signal, a **6H singlet** at **~1 ppm**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The distinguishing NOESY cross-peak in the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons (Hb) and the vinylic methyl groups (Me-A).\n    *   This corresponds to the connection between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\nLet's verify this against the given options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me-B) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (part of CH2 bridge).\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me-B) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me-A).\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me-A) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Hb).\n*   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (part of CH2 bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Hb).\n\nOur analysis points directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a highly symmetric structure, as indicated by its NMR spectra:\n        *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This corresponds to two chemically equivalent vinylic protons.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons, C=O).\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**, which is formed from the dehydration of *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). The two vinylic protons are equivalent, as are the two vinylic carbons and the two carbonyl carbons. Maleic anhydride will act as the dienophile in the subsequent reaction.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. Its structure is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, each bearing a methyl group. The 5th position is a CH₂ group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. Specifically, it creates a **bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene** core structure.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants:\n        *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). This matches the formula given in the problem.\n\n3.  **Identify the Products and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the ***endo*** and ***exo*** products.\n    *   According to the **Alder endo rule**, the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored product and therefore the **major product**. The *exo* product is the thermodynamically more stable but kinetically disfavored product, making it the **minor product**.\n    *   Let's visualize the difference:\n        *   ***Endo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the one-carbon bridge (the CH₂ group at C7). The two protons on the carbons where the anhydride is fused (let's call them H_α at C2 and C3) are positioned under the C5=C6 double bond.\n        *   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 CH₂ bridge. The H_α protons point away from the C5=C6 double bond.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NMR Spectra and the NOESY Cross-Peak:**\n    *   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected by chemical bonds.\n    *   The question states that a particular cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent or weak in the minor product**. This means we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product has a plane of symmetry, making pairs of groups chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Vinylic methyl groups:** Two methyl groups on the C5=C6 double bond. They are equivalent. This should be a 6H singlet. Their chemical shift would be around **~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** Two methyl groups on the C1 and C4 bridgehead carbons. They are equivalent. This should be a 6H singlet. Their chemical shift would be in the typical alkyl region, around **~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Anhydride methine protons (H_α):** The two protons at the ring junction (C2, C3). They are equivalent and are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups of the anhydride, so they will be significantly deshielded. This should be a 2H singlet at a higher chemical shift, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridge methylene protons:** The two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic (one *syn*, one *anti* to the double bond) and would likely appear as two separate signals (e.g., two 1H doublets due to geminal coupling). Their chemical shift would be around **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n6.  **Relate NOESY Data to Structure:**\n    *   Let's examine the key distances in the two isomers:\n        *   **In the *endo* (major) product:** The anhydride methine protons (H_α at ~3.5 ppm) are located directly under the double bond. This brings them very **close** to the **vinylic methyl groups** (~1.7 ppm). A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n        *   **In the *exo* (minor) product:** The anhydride methine protons (H_α at ~3.5 ppm) are pointed away from the double bond. They are **far** from the **vinylic methyl groups** (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, the corresponding NOE cross-peak would be absent or very weak. Conversely, these protons would be close to the C7 bridge protons (~1.5 ppm).\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product must be the one connecting the anhydride methine protons and the vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   Based on our assignments, this is the cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\n8.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> Interaction strong in *minor* product.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm -> Interaction present in both products.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm -> Interaction present in both products.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> Interaction strong in *major* product. This matches our analysis.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's spectral data are key:\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent and are in a vinylic or aromatic environment.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene/aromatic region) and 165 ppm (carbonyl region).\n        *   The only simple structure that fits this data is **maleic anhydride**. It has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. This results in one ¹H signal and two ¹³C signals, with chemical shifts matching the data provided. Maleic anhydride is a classic dienophile for the Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The second reactant is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic, conjugated diene, perfect for a Diels-Alder reaction. The structure is a five-membered ring with a CH₂ group at position 5 and methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition**.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   According to the Alder endo rule, the *endo* adduct is typically the major product, formed via a transition state with stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. The *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Anhydride C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃), which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Structures and NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene core structure.\n        *   Methyl groups are at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and the vinylic positions (C2, C3).\n        *   The anhydride ring is fused to the C5-C6 bridge.\n        *   The C7 position is a CH₂ bridge.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry (a plane bisecting the C2=C3 and C5-C6 bonds), we can predict the ¹H NMR signals:\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls (on C1, C4):** These two methyl groups are equivalent. They are attached to saturated, quaternary carbons. They will appear as a **6H singlet** at a relatively low chemical shift, around **~1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyls (on C2, C3):** These two methyl groups are also equivalent. They are attached to a double bond. They will appear as a **6H singlet** at a higher shift than the bridgehead methyls, typically **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride Protons (on C5, C6):** These two methine protons are equivalent. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups. They will appear as a **2H singlet** at a significantly higher shift, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Methylene Bridge Protons (on C7):** These two protons are diastereotopic and would likely form a complex pattern (an AB quartet), not a simple singlet.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Data:**\n    *   NOESY shows through-space correlations between protons that are close to each other (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** and **absent in the minor product**. This means we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Let's analyze the stereochemistry:\n        *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) to the C7 methylene bridge. In this arrangement, the protons on the anhydride bridge (H5, H6) are in the *exo* position (pointing away from the C7 bridge). The vinylic methyl groups (on C2, C3) are also on the \"top\" or *exo* face of the bicyclic system. Because the *exo*-protons (H5, H6) and the vinylic methyls are on the same face of the molecule, they are spatially close. **A NOE cross-peak is expected.**\n        *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. In this case, the protons on the anhydride bridge (H5, H6) are in the *endo* position (pointing towards the C7 bridge). The vinylic methyls remain on the *exo* face. Now, the anhydride protons (*endo*) and the vinylic methyls (*exo*) are on opposite faces of the molecule and are far apart. **No significant NOE is expected.**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The NOE cross-peak observed only in the major product connects the vinylic methyl protons and the anhydride methine protons.\n    *   Matching this to our signal assignments:\n        *   Vinylic methyls: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n        *   Anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid (HOOC-CH=CH-COOH).\n    *   Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride.\n    *   Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinyl protons (-CH=CH-) chemically equivalent. Their chemical shift is typically around 7 ppm, which matches the description.\n    *   Maleic anhydride has two types of carbon atoms: two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and two equivalent vinyl carbons (-CH=CH-). This leads to two signals in the ¹³C NMR spectrum. The carbonyl carbons appear around 165 ppm, and the vinyl carbons around 137 ppm. This perfectly matches the provided data.\n    *   Therefore, the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a conjugated diene, suitable for a Diels-Alder reaction. Its structure is a five-membered ring with a CH₂ group at position 5, double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4, and methyl groups attached to C1, C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   **The Products:** This reaction typically produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed. In Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is usually the kinetically favored (major) product, while the *exo* product is the thermodynamically favored (minor) product.\n*   **Molecular Formula Check:** The diene (C₉H₁₄) reacts with the anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) to form an adduct with the formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the molecular formula given in the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Structures of the Major and Minor Products**\n\nThe key difference between the *endo* and *exo* products lies in the relative stereochemistry of the fused anhydride ring. We need to determine which protons are close in space in one isomer but far apart in the other.\n\n*   **Standard Convention for Cyclopentadiene Adducts:**\n    *   ***Endo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the one-carbon bridge (the CH₂ group, C7 in bicyclic numbering). This orientation places the anhydride ring \"under\" the C2=C3 double bond of the original diene system. This allows for stabilizing secondary orbital interactions, making it the kinetic product.\n    *   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the CH₂ bridge. This is sterically less hindered and thus more thermodynamically stable.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the NOESY NMR Data**\n\n*   **NOESY Principle:** 2D NOESY NMR spectroscopy shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity.\n*   **The Differentiating Cross-Peak:** The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximity Analysis:**\n    *   In the ***endo* (major) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the molecule. This brings the two protons on the anhydride moiety (let's call them H_a) into close proximity with the two methyl groups on the C=C double bond (let's call them Me_vinyl).\n    *   In the ***exo* (minor) product**, the anhydride ring is flipped up. The H_a protons are now far away from the Me_vinyl groups. Instead, they are closer to the CH₂ bridge protons.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major product must be between the anhydride protons (H_a) and the vinyl methyl protons (Me_vinyl).\n\n**Step 5: Assign NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option**\n\nNow, we need to assign the expected ¹H NMR signals to these groups and match them to the given options. The product has a high degree of symmetry (a C_s plane).\n\n*   **Anhydride Protons (H_a):** There are two of them. They are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing anhydride group.\n    *   **Integral:** 2H\n    *   **Multiplicity:** Singlet (any long-range coupling is likely unresolved).\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Typically ~3.5 ppm.\n\n*   **Vinyl Methyl Protons (Me_vinyl):** There are two methyl groups on the double bond. They are equivalent by symmetry.\n    *   **Integral:** 6H (2 x CH₃)\n    *   **Multiplicity:** Singlet.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** For methyl groups on a double bond, typically ~1.7 ppm.\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak connects these two signals. We are looking for an option that describes a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n*   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect integral (1H).\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect integral (1H).\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** - This perfectly matches our prediction for the vinyl methyl protons (6H, ~1.7 ppm) and the anhydride protons (2H, ~3.5 ppm).\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be an interaction between the two different sets of methyl groups (vinyl and bridgehead). The relative orientation of these groups is the same in both the *endo* and *exo* isomers, so this cross-peak would be present in both spectra, not just the major product's.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak unique to the major product connects the resonances described in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates that all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. A peak around 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, and a peak around 137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon.\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid). Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's check if maleic anhydride fits the NMR data. Maleic anhydride is a planar, five-membered ring with a C=C double bond and two C=O groups. It possesses a high degree of symmetry. The two alkene protons are equivalent, and the two alkene carbons are equivalent. The two carbonyl carbons are also equivalent. This would lead to one ¹H signal and two ¹³C signals, which matches the data provided. The chemical shifts (¹H at 7 ppm, ¹³C at 137 ppm for C=C and 165 ppm for C=O) are also fully consistent with the structure of maleic anhydride.\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile in the reaction is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated system.\n\n**Step 2: The Reaction and Its Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n*   When a cyclic diene like cyclopentadiene reacts, two stereoisomeric products can be formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   According to the **Alder endo rule**, the kinetically controlled product, which is typically the major product, is the *endo* adduct. In the *endo* adduct, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the bicyclic system (in this case, the C=C bond from the diene). A more intuitive way for cyclopentadiene adducts is that the dienophile substituents are on the same side as the C7 methylene bridge.\n*   Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* adduct** and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Structure and NMR of the Products for NOESY**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of J-coupling.\n*   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to identify a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   **Proton Assignments in the Product:**\n    1.  **H_anhydride**: The two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring is fused (let's call them C5 and C6). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent and deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls. They correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    2.  **Me_vinylic**: The two methyl groups on the double bond (C2, C3). They are equivalent due to symmetry. Their chemical shift is typical for vinylic methyls. They correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    3.  **Me_bridgehead**: The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). They are equivalent due to symmetry and are in an allylic/aliphatic environment. They correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n    4.  **C7-H**: The two protons on the methylene bridge (C7). They are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They are coupled to each other, so they should appear as a pair of doublets (an AB quartet). The problem mentions a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, which must be one of these two protons.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships (Proximity):**\n    *   ***Endo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons (at ~3.5 ppm) are pointing into the bicyclic \"cage\". This brings them close to:\n        *   The **C7-H** protons (e.g., the one at ~1.5 ppm).\n        *   The **Me_vinylic** groups (~1.7 ppm), which are located at the other end of the cage.\n    *   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons now point away from the cage. This makes them:\n        *   **Far** from the C7-H protons.\n        *   **Far** from the Me_vinylic groups.\n        *   **Close** to the Me_bridgehead groups (~1.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Identifying the Differentiating Cross-Peak:**\n    The cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product must arise from a proximity that exists only in the *endo* isomer. Based on our analysis, two such proximities exist:\n    1.  **H_anhydride** (~3.5 ppm) <=> **C7-H** (~1.5 ppm) -> This corresponds to **Option A**.\n    2.  **H_anhydride** (~3.5 ppm) <=> **Me_vinylic** (~1.7 ppm) -> This corresponds to **Option D**.\n\n*   **Choosing Between Option A and Option D:**\n    Both describe valid NOEs that confirm the *endo* structure. However, we must choose the best answer. Let's consider the expected intensity of the NOE cross-peak. The intensity of a cross-peak in a NOESY spectrum is related (among other things) to the number of protons giving rise to the signals.\n    *   Option A involves an interaction between a 2H singlet and a 1H doublet.\n    *   Option D involves an interaction between a 2H singlet and a 6H singlet.\n    *   The interaction between the 2H and 6H groups involves a much larger number of protons than the interaction between the 2H and 1H groups. For a similar distance, this will result in a significantly more intense and easily observable cross-peak.\n    *   Furthermore, the NOE between the anhydride protons and the vinylic substituents is the classic, textbook example used to assign *endo* stereochemistry in Diels-Alder adducts of cyclopentadiene.\n\n    Therefore, the most prominent and characteristic cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product is the one between the vinylic methyl groups and the anhydride protons.\n\nFinal Answer Selection: The cross-peak connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinylic) and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride). This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The anhydride has a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm. This indicates all its protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The anhydride has two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum at 137 ppm (alkene region) and 165 ppm (carbonyl region). This indicates two types of carbon atoms.\n    *   The simplest structure fitting this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid).\n        *   **Structure:** A five-membered ring with two carbonyls and a C=C double bond.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** It has two equivalent vinyl protons, which would give a singlet. A chemical shift of 7 ppm is reasonable for protons on a double bond that is part of a conjugated, electron-withdrawing system.\n        *   **¹³C NMR:** It has two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, leading to two signals. The given chemical shifts (137 ppm and 165 ppm) are characteristic for these carbon types.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   **Structure:** It's a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds between C1-C2 and C3-C4. A methyl group is attached to each of these four carbons. The fifth carbon (C5) is a CH₂ group.\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₄.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride). This is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   **Products:** The Diels-Alder reaction can result in two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed. In Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the kinetic product and thus the **major product**, while the *exo* product is the thermodynamic product and typically the **minor product**.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n    *   The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative: **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry and Structure of the Products**\n\n*   Let's define the stereochemistry for this system. The *endo* adduct is the one where the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) of the bicyclic system as the methylene bridge (C7). In this conformation, the two protons on the anhydride part (Hₐ) are pointing towards the C=C double bond.\n*   The *exo* adduct is the one where the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the bicyclic system from the methylene bridge (C7). In this conformation, the two protons on the anhydride part (Hₐ) are pointing away from the C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** The protons Hₐ are directed towards the C=C bond, which bears the vinylic methyl groups (Meᵥ).\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** The protons Hₐ are directed away from the C=C bond and the vinylic methyl groups (Meᵥ).\n\n**4. Analyze the NMR Spectra and the NOESY Cross-Peak**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy):** This technique reveals which protons are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals means the corresponding protons are in close proximity.\n*   **The Key Information:** A cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n*   Based on our structural analysis in Step 3, the distance between the anhydride protons (Hₐ) and the vinylic methyl groups (Meᵥ) is short in the *endo* (major) product and long in the *exo* (minor) product. Therefore, the unique cross-peak in the major product's spectrum must be between **Hₐ** and **Meᵥ**.\n\n**5. Assign the NMR Signals**\n\nNow we need to assign the signals described in the options to the specific protons in the molecule. Both isomers have a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Signal Types and Integrals:**\n    *   **Vinylic Methyls (Meᵥ):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond. Signal: **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls (Me_bh):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. Signal: **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (Hₐ):** Two equivalent protons where the anhydride ring is fused. Signal: **2H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridge Protons (H_b):** Two diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ bridge. They would likely give two 1H signals, coupled to each other (e.g., two doublets or an AB quartet). The \"1H doublet\" in the options likely refers to one of these.\n\n*   **Chemical Shift (δ) Assignment:**\n    *   Vinylic methyls are deshielded compared to saturated alkyl methyls. A reasonable shift is **~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   Bridgehead methyls are on saturated carbons. A reasonable shift is **~1 ppm**.\n    *   Anhydride protons (Hₐ) are α to carbonyl groups in a strained ring. They will be significantly deshielded. A reasonable shift is **~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   Bridge protons (H_b) are in a saturated, bicyclic environment. A reasonable shift is **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\n*   The NOESY cross-peak unique to the major product connects the vinylic methyl protons (Meᵥ) and the anhydride protons (Hₐ).\n*   Our assignment for these signals is:\n    *   **Meᵥ:** 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   **Hₐ:** 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n*   This corresponds to the pair of resonances described in option D.\n\nLet's check the other options:\n*   A) Me_bh (~1 ppm) and H_b (~1.5 ppm): This distance should be similar in both isomers.\n*   B) H_b (~1.5 ppm) and Hₐ (~3.5 ppm): The distance between these depends on which bridge proton (syn or anti) and which isomer (endo or exo) is considered. It's not as clear-cut as the Hₐ-Meᵥ interaction for differentiating the isomers.\n*   C) Me_bh (~1 ppm) and Meᵥ (~1.7 ppm): These are on adjacent carbons, and their distance should be short and similar in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly identifies a pair of protons that are close in the major (*endo*) isomer and far in the minor (*exo*) isomer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **The Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in its ¹³C NMR.\n        *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃). Due to its C₂ᵥ symmetry, the two protons on the double bond are equivalent, leading to a single peak in the ¹H NMR. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of olefinic protons deshielded by two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n        *   Similarly, there are only two types of carbon atoms: the two equivalent olefinic carbons and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons. This leads to two peaks in the ¹³C NMR. The chemical shifts of ~137 ppm (olefinic C=C) and ~165 ppm (carbonyl C=O) are consistent with this structure.\n        *   Therefore, the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n    *   **The Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a conjugated diene with the formula C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct. The reaction yields two diastereomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n    *   The molecular formula of the products will be the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n\n3.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction typically follows the \"endo rule,\" where the major product is the *endo* adduct due to favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   However, the endo rule can be overridden by significant steric hindrance. In this case, the diene has four methyl groups, including two at the reacting carbons (C1 and C4). In the *endo* transition state, the anhydride molecule tucks \"under\" the diene, leading to a significant steric clash with the methyl groups at C1 and C4. The *exo* transition state, where the anhydride is further away from these methyl groups, is less sterically hindered.\n    *   Therefore, for this specific reaction, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *endo* adduct**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures and NOESY Spectra**\n    *   **NOESY** (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the major (*exo*) product but far apart in the minor (*endo*) product.\n    *   Let's analyze the proton signals and their positions in the two isomers. The products have a plane of symmetry, leading to four main types of proton signals in the ¹H NMR:\n        *   **H_alpha (2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm):** The two protons on the anhydride part of the molecule.\n        *   **Me_vinyl (6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm):** The two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Me_bridgehead (6H singlet, ~1.0 ppm):** The two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons.\n        *   **H_bridge (2H, complex signal):** The two diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ bridge (not relevant for the options provided).\n\n    *   **Structure of the Major (*exo*) Product:**\n        *   In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (away from) the CH₂ bridge. This orients the **H_alpha** protons towards the C=C double bond.\n        *   This geometry brings the **H_alpha** protons very close to the **Me_vinyl** groups.\n        *   Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between **H_alpha** and **Me_vinyl**.\n\n    *   **Structure of the Minor (*endo*) Product:**\n        *   In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) the CH₂ bridge. This orients the **H_alpha** protons away from the C=C double bond.\n        *   In this geometry, the **H_alpha** protons and the **Me_vinyl** groups are far apart.\n        *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak between **H_alpha** and **Me_vinyl** will be absent or very weak.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product.\n    *   Our analysis shows that the cross-peak between **H_alpha** (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) and **Me_vinyl** (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet) fits this description perfectly.\n    *   This corresponds to the pair of resonances described in option A.\n\nFinal Answer Selection:\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_alpha)**: This matches our conclusion.\n*   B), C), D): These describe interactions that are either weak, absent, or not unique to the major product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes the dehydration of a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid to an anhydride.\n        *   ¹H NMR of the anhydride: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent vinylic protons (a chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons deshielded by adjacent carbonyl groups).\n        *   ¹³C NMR of the anhydride: Two peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).\n        *   The only structure that fits this data is **maleic anhydride**, which is formed from *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). It is a planar molecule with a C₂v symmetry axis, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two vinylic carbons equivalent, as well as the two carbonyl carbons equivalent.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, each bearing a methyl group, and a CH₂ group at position 5.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**\n    *   The reaction between the anhydride (dienophile) and the diene is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The product's molecular formula is C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₄H₂O₃ for maleic anhydride and C₉H₁₄ for the diene).\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **endo rule** predicts that the major product is typically the *endo* adduct, due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by significant steric hindrance. The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, has bulky methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions, which are involved in the new bond formation. These methyl groups sterically hinder the *endo* approach of the dienophile.\n    *   Therefore, in this specific case, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *endo* adduct**. This is a known exception to the endo rule, confirmed by literature.\n        *   **Major Product = Exo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the *exo* face of the bicyclic system (on the same side as the C7 methylene bridge).\n        *   **Minor Product = Endo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the *endo* face (on the opposite side of the C7 bridge).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Product Structure and Proton NMR Signals**\n    *   The product has a plane of symmetry passing through the C7 bridge and the center of the C=C and anhydride bonds.\n    *   This symmetry makes pairs of protons and methyl groups equivalent. We expect the following signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n        *   **Vinylic Methyls (`Me_alkene`):** Two methyl groups on the C=C double bond (at C2, C3). They are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Chemical shift for vinylic methyls is typically ~1.6-2.0 ppm.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls (`Me_bridgehead`):** Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). They are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Chemical shift for saturated methyls is typically lower, ~1.0-1.5 ppm.\n        *   **Anhydride Protons (`H_anhydride`):** Two protons on the carbons from maleic anhydride (at C5, C6). They are equivalent. Signal: **2H singlet**. Being alpha to carbonyl groups, they are deshielded, with a typical shift of ~3.0-4.0 ppm.\n        *   **Bridge Protons (`H_bridge`):** Two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge. They would likely appear as two separate signals (e.g., two doublets), but are not central to the options provided.\n\n5.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) cross-peak indicates that two sets of protons are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent/weak in the minor product**.\n    *   We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* adduct (major) but far apart in the *endo* adduct (minor).\n\n    *   **In the Exo Adduct (Major Product):**\n        *   The anhydride ring is *exo*. The two `H_anhydride` protons are on the *endo* face. This means they point \"down\" towards the C2=C3 double bond.\n        *   The `Me_alkene` groups are also on the \"bottom\" part of the structure.\n        *   Therefore, the *endo* `H_anhydride` protons are **spatially close** to the `Me_alkene` protons. A strong NOE is expected.\n\n    *   **In the Endo Adduct (Minor Product):**\n        *   The anhydride ring is *endo*. The two `H_anhydride` protons are on the *exo* face. This means they point \"up\" away from the C2=C3 double bond and towards the C7 bridge.\n        *   Therefore, the *exo* `H_anhydride` protons are **spatially far** from the `Me_alkene` protons. The NOE would be absent or very weak.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** The distinguishing cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the `H_anhydride` protons and the `Me_alkene` protons.\n\n6.  **Match with the Given Options**\n    *   We are looking for the signals corresponding to `H_anhydride` and `Me_alkene`.\n    *   `H_anhydride` = 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   `Me_alkene` = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n\n    Let's evaluate the options:\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This perfectly matches the signals for `Me_alkene` and `H_anhydride`, which are the protons that show proximity in the major (*exo*) product.\n    *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This describes an interaction between a bridge proton and the anhydride protons, which is not the key differentiating interaction.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: Describes an interaction between the bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: Describes an interaction between the two different types of methyl groups, which are not uniquely close in the major product.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n        *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically and magnetically equivalent vinylic protons. The chemical shift is downfield due to electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. Maleic acid is *cis*-butenedioic acid, and its dehydration yields the five-membered cyclic anhydride. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent.\n\n    *   **Reactant 2:** **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene. The structure has a five-membered ring with double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4. Methyl groups are attached to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. Carbon 5 is a CH₂ group. The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* product is typically the major product, formed under kinetic control. The *exo* product is the minor product.\n    *   Major product = *endo* adduct.\n    *   Minor product = *exo* adduct.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula of the product: C₄H₂O₃ (maleic anhydride) + C₉H₁₄ (diene) → C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Products and Assign Protons:**\n    Let's draw the product and use standard bicyclic numbering.\n    *   The diene's C1-C4 and the dienophile's two carbons form a new six-membered ring.\n    *   A new C=C double bond is formed between the diene's C2 and C3 positions. These carbons each bear a methyl group.\n    *   The diene's C1 and C4 become the bridgehead carbons. These carbons also each bear a methyl group.\n    *   The diene's C5 (the CH₂ group) becomes the C7 bridge of the bicyclic system.\n    *   The maleic anhydride carbons become C5 and C6, with the anhydride ring fused to the structure. The two protons from the maleic anhydride are on C5 and C6.\n\n    Let's predict the ¹H NMR signals for the product:\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). These are shielded and should appear upfield. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Vinyl Methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the new C=C double bond (C2, C3). These are deshielded compared to the bridgehead methyls. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (Hₐ):** Two equivalent protons on C5 and C6. They are alpha to carbonyl groups, so they are significantly deshielded. The adjacent bridgehead carbons (C1, C4) are quaternary, so these protons will not be split. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridge Protons (C7-H):** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the C=C double bond, one is *anti*). They will couple to each other (geminal coupling) but not to the quaternary bridgehead carbons. They should appear as two doublets. The problem mentions a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, which is one of these protons.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra to Distinguish *Endo* and *Exo* Isomers:**\n    *   **NOESY** (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find a pair of protons that are uniquely close in the *endo* isomer.\n    *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** In the *endo* configuration, the anhydride ring (and its protons, Hₐ) is tucked underneath the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C7 bridge. This brings the anhydride protons (Hₐ on C5/C6) into close proximity with the protons on the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** In the *exo* configuration, the anhydride ring points away from the C7 bridge. The Hₐ protons are now far from the C7 bridge protons.\n\n    Therefore, the NOE cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product is between the **anhydride protons (Hₐ)** and the **C7 bridge protons**.\n\n5.  **Match the Protons to the Resonances in the Options:**\n    *   The anhydride protons (Hₐ) give the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   One of the C7 bridge protons gives the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n    The NOESY cross-peak in the major product will connect these two signals.\n\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 bridge proton). These are not uniquely close in the endo isomer.\n    B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). These would be close in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) product.\n    C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. These are two different methyl groups. An NOE between them would likely exist in both isomers.\n    D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). This matches our analysis perfectly. This spatial proximity is the defining characteristic of the *endo* isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   The first reactant is an anhydride derived from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The NMR data for this anhydride is given: `1H NMR` shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and `13C NMR` shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   Let's analyze the NMR data for the anhydride:\n        *   `1H NMR`: A single peak at 7 ppm indicates two or more protons that are chemically equivalent and are in the vinylic or aromatic region.\n        *   `13C NMR`: Two peaks. The peak at 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O). The peak at 137 ppm is characteristic of a vinylic carbon (C=C).\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride.\n    *   Let's check if maleic anhydride fits the data:\n        *   Structure: A five-membered ring containing O-C(=O)-CH=CH-C(=O)-.\n        *   Symmetry: The molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, as well as the two vinylic carbons equivalent.\n        *   `1H NMR`: One signal for the two equivalent vinylic protons. The chemical shift is indeed around 7.08 ppm.\n        *   `13C NMR`: Two signals. One for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm) and one for the two equivalent vinylic carbons (~135 ppm).\n    *   The data perfectly matches maleic anhydride. So, the first reactant is maleic anhydride (C4H2O3).\n    *   The second reactant is explicitly named: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C9H14).\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride). This is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   The product is a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula is C4H2O3 + C9H14 = C13H16O3, which matches the information provided.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the Alder rule, the *endo* adduct is the kinetic product and is typically the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamic product and is typically the **minor product**.\n    *   Let's establish the structure of these adducts. The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene skeleton.\n        *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite face) to the C7 methylene bridge. This places the two protons on the anhydride-fused carbons (let's call them H-2 and H-3) in the *exo* position (pointing towards the C7 bridge).\n        *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same face) to the C7 methylene bridge. This places H-2 and H-3 in the *endo* position (pointing away from the C7 bridge, towards the C=C double bond).\n\n3.  **Analyze the NMR Spectra of the Products:**\n    *   Due to a plane of symmetry in both the *endo* and *exo* products, the `1H NMR` spectrum is expected to show:\n        *   A 6H singlet for the two equivalent bridgehead methyl groups (on C1 and C4).\n        *   A 6H singlet for the two equivalent vinylic methyl groups (on C5 and C6).\n        *   A 2H singlet for the two equivalent protons H-2 and H-3. A chemical shift of ~3.5 ppm is reasonable for these protons, which are alpha to carbonyl groups.\n        *   Two signals for the two diastereotopic protons of the C7 methylene bridge. These would likely appear as a pair of doublets (an AB quartet). A chemical shift of ~1.5 ppm is reasonable for these aliphatic protons.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Data:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5Å).\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists only in the *endo* adduct.\n    *   Let's analyze the spatial relationships in each isomer:\n        *   **Major Product (Endo adduct):**\n            *   The protons H-2 and H-3 are in the *exo* position.\n            *   In this orientation, the *exo* protons are close to the bridgehead substituents. Here, the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4) have methyl groups. Therefore, an NOE is expected between the H-2/H-3 protons and the bridgehead methyl protons.\n            *   The *exo* H-2/H-3 protons are relatively far from the C7 bridge protons and the vinylic methyl groups.\n        *   **Minor Product (Exo adduct):**\n            *   The protons H-2 and H-3 are in the *endo* position.\n            *   In this orientation, the *endo* protons are far from the bridgehead methyl groups.\n            *   They are, however, close to the vinylic methyl groups (on C5, C6) and the C7 bridge protons.\n\n5.  **Match the Analysis with the Options:**\n    *   The unique NOE in the major product is between the H-2/H-3 protons and the bridgehead methyl protons.\n    *   Let's identify the corresponding signals from the options:\n        *   The H-2/H-3 protons give the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`.\n        *   The bridgehead methyl protons give one of the `6H singlets` (e.g., the one at `~1.7 ppm`).\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` and a `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm`.\n\n    *   This corresponds directly to **Option D**.\n\n    *   Let's quickly check why other options are incorrect:\n        *   A) 6H singlet and 6H singlet: Interaction between the two sets of methyl groups. This interaction would be present in both isomers.\n        *   B) 6H singlet and 1H doublet: Interaction between a methyl group and a C7 proton. This would also likely be present in both isomers to some extent.\n        *   C) 1H doublet and 2H singlet: Interaction between a C7 proton and the H-2/H-3 protons. This interaction is characteristic of the *minor (exo)* product, not the major one.\n\nFinal conclusion is that the cross-peak is between the H-2/H-3 protons and the bridgehead methyl groups, which is described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n\n    *   **Dienophile (from the dicarboxylic acid):** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's spectral data is key:\n        *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift (7 ppm) is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond).\n        *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. A peak around 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), and a peak around 137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon (C=C).\n        *   The simplest structure that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, resulting in the observed simple NMR spectra. The chemical shifts are also consistent with those of maleic anhydride.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4. It has methyl groups on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at C5.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Diels-Alder Reaction and Products**\n\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The product's molecular formula is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (from C₉H₁₄ diene + C₄H₂O₃ anhydride), which matches the information given.\n    *   Like most Diels-Alder reactions, this one can produce two stereoisomeric products: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n        *   The **endo adduct** is generally the major product due to kinetic control arising from favorable secondary orbital interactions. In this product, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the one-carbon bridge (the C7 methylene bridge).\n        *   The **exo adduct** is generally the minor product. In this product, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the one-carbon bridge.\n\n3.  **Relate Structure to the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates a spatial proximity between the corresponding protons.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or very weak) in the minor product. This means we must find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and Proton Proximity**\n\n    *   Let's visualize the structures:\n        *   **Endo Product (Major):** The bicyclic system has a V-shape. In the endo isomer, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the newly formed cyclohexene ring. This places the two protons that came from maleic anhydride (let's call them **H_anhydride**) very close to the methyl groups on the double bond of the bicyclic system (let's call them **Me_vinyl**).\n        *   **Exo Product (Minor):** In the exo isomer, the anhydride ring is flipped away. This moves the **H_anhydride** protons far away from the **Me_vinyl** groups. Instead, they are now closer to the protons on the C7 methylene bridge.\n\n    *   Therefore, the unique NOE interaction in the major (endo) product is between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **Me_vinyl** protons.\n\n5.  **Predict the ¹H NMR Signals for the Interacting Protons**\n\n    *   **H_anhydride:** These two protons are on the carbons adjacent to the anhydride's carbonyl groups. They are chemically equivalent due to a plane of symmetry in the product. They have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they will appear as a **singlet**. Their integral will be **2H**. Being next to electron-withdrawing carbonyls, they will be deshielded, appearing at a chemical shift of approximately **3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Me_vinyl:** These are the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond in the product (originally on C2 and C3 of the diene). They are also equivalent by symmetry. They will appear as a **singlet** with an integral of **6H**. The typical chemical shift for vinylic methyl groups is around **1.7 ppm**.\n\n6.  **Match the Prediction with the Given Options**\n\n    *   We are looking for a NOESY cross-peak connecting a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_anhydride) and a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (Me_vinyl).\n    *   Let's examine the options:\n        *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect signal type/integral (1H doublet).\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect signal type/integral (1H doublet).\n        *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This perfectly matches our prediction.**\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be an interaction between the bridgehead methyls (~1 ppm) and the vinyl methyls (~1.7 ppm). This interaction would exist in both isomers and is not the unique interaction differentiating the major and minor products.\n\nThe cross-peak present in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects the 6H singlet from the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) and the 2H singlet from the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's spectral data is given:\n        *   `1H NMR`: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   `13C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This indicates two types of carbon atoms.\n    *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. Maleic anhydride is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). It has a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent (shift ~7.0 ppm) and the two alkene carbons equivalent (~137 ppm). The two carbonyl carbons are also equivalent (~165 ppm).\n    *   The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a substituted cyclopentadiene, which acts as the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. Its structure is a five-membered ring with a CH₂ group and four methyl groups on the four carbons of the conjugated diene system.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. Specifically, it will form a **bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene** derivative.\n    *   The reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the ***endo*** and ***exo*** products. The problem states that two products are formed (a major and a minor one).\n\n3.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products**\n    *   The **Alder-endo rule** predicts that the *endo* product is typically the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. This places the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) underneath the newly formed cyclohexene ring.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by significant **steric hindrance**. In this case, the diene has four methyl groups. In the *endo* transition state, the incoming anhydride ring would be on the same face as the CH₂ bridge, but it would also be very close to the methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 of the diene (which become the bridgehead positions in the product). This creates substantial steric repulsion.\n    *   The *exo* transition state, where the anhydride ring points away from the diene's methyl groups, is sterically much more favorable.\n    *   Therefore, in this specific reaction, the **exo product is the major product**, and the *endo* product is the minor product.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures of the Products and their Spatial Relationships**\n    *   Let's draw the skeleton of the product, a 1,4,5,6-tetramethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride. This name is complex, let's focus on the key structural features and proton locations for NOESY analysis. The product has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Proton environments:**\n        *   **Me-alkene:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2=C3). Total 6H. Expected shift for vinylic methyls is ~1.7-2.0 ppm.\n        *   **Me-bridgehead:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). Total 6H. Expected shift for alkyl methyls is lower, ~1.0-1.3 ppm.\n        *   **H-anhydride:** Two equivalent protons on the carbons where the anhydride is fused (C5, C6). Total 2H. Expected shift for protons alpha to a carbonyl is ~3-4 ppm.\n        *   **CH₂-bridge:** Two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge. Total 2H.\n    *   **NOESY relies on through-space proximity (< 5 Å).** We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the major product but far in the minor product.\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Major Product):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* to the CH₂ bridge. This places the H-anhydride protons (at C5 and C6) in the *endo* position, meaning they are tucked underneath the C2=C3 double bond. This brings them very close to the **Me-alkene** groups.\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Minor Product):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is *syn* to the CH₂ bridge. This places the H-anhydride protons in the *exo* position, pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond. They are far from the **Me-alkene** groups but are close to the **Me-bridgehead** groups.\n\n5.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum and Assign Resonances**\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present** in the major product's spectrum but absent/weak in the minor product's.\n    *   Based on our analysis, the close proximity between **H-anhydride** and **Me-alkene** is the unique feature of the **exo (major)** product.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in question connects the signals for H-anhydride and Me-alkene.\n    *   Now, we assign the chemical shifts given in the options to our proton types:\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This corresponds to the two equivalent **Me-alkene** groups.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** This corresponds to the two equivalent **Me-bridgehead** groups.\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This corresponds to the two equivalent **H-anhydride** protons.\n        *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is one of the diastereotopic **CH₂-bridge** protons.\n    *   The cross-peak in the major product connects the **Me-alkene** protons and the **H-anhydride** protons.\n    *   This corresponds to the resonances at **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)** and **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)**.\n\n6.  **Select the Correct Answer**\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me-bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me-alkene). These are far apart.\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (CH2 bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H-anhydride). This interaction (between H-anhydride and the bridge) would be strong in the *endo* (minor) product, not the major one.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me-alkene) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H-anhydride). This matches our conclusion perfectly.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me-bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (CH2 bridge). This distance is fixed in the bicyclic frame and should be similar in both isomers.\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene, which dehydrates to an anhydride.\n        *   The anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all its protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   It has two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This indicates two types of carbon atoms.\n        *   The only structure that fits these data is maleic anhydride. It has C₂v symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, and the two alkene carbons equivalent. The chemical shifts are also consistent with this structure.\n        *   Structure of maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃): A five-membered ring with an oxygen atom, two C=O groups, and a C=C double bond (O=C-CH=CH-C=O).\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄). This is a five-membered ring with a CH₂ group at C5 and methyl groups at positions C1, C2, C3, and C4.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the problem statement.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   According to the Alder-Eberius rule (the *endo* rule), the major product of a kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reaction is the *endo* adduct. The minor product is the *exo* adduct.\n    *   The question focuses on the **major product**, which is the **endo adduct**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry and Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the one-carbon bridge (the C7 bridge, which is a CH₂ group). In this conformation, the two protons that originated from the maleic anhydride are tucked underneath the newly formed six-membered ring.\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. The protons from the anhydride point away from the bicyclic system.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY NMR Data:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent or weak in the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   This means we must identify a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n5.  **Assign Proton Signals and Identify the Key NOE:**\n    *   Let's identify the different types of protons in the product and estimate their chemical shifts:\n        *   **H(anhydride):** The two protons from the maleic anhydride moiety. By symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. Being adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring, they will be downfield. A shift of **~3.5 ppm** is a reasonable estimate.\n        *   **Me(vinyl):** The two methyl groups on the C=C double bond of the newly formed ring (at positions C2 and C3). By symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Vinylic methyl groups typically resonate around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Me(bridgehead):** The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). By symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as another **6H singlet**. Tertiary alkyl methyl groups are typically more shielded (upfield), so a shift of **~1.0 ppm** is reasonable.\n        *   **H(bridge):** The two protons on the C7 bridge (the CH₂ group). They are diastereotopic and will appear as two distinct signals, likely coupled to each other (geminal coupling), forming an AB quartet or two doublets. Their shift would be in the aliphatic region, around **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n    *   Now, let's look for protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but not the *exo*:\n        *   In the *endo* structure, the H(anhydride) protons are held under the C2=C3 double bond. This places them very close to the **Me(vinyl)** groups.\n        *   In the *exo* structure, the H(anhydride) protons point away from the C2=C3 double bond, and the distance to the Me(vinyl) groups is much larger.\n        *   Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak between the H(anhydride) protons and the Me(vinyl) protons is expected for the major (*endo*) product, and this peak would be absent or very weak for the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   The key NOE connects the H(anhydride) protons and the Me(vinyl) protons.\n    *   H(anhydride) signal: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   Me(vinyl) signal: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This corresponds exactly to the description in **Option B**.\n\n    *   Let's briefly check the other options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me(bridgehead)) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H(bridge)): These are close in both isomers.\n        *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H(bridge)) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H(anhydride)): This interaction also exists in the *endo* adduct but not the *exo*. However, the interaction described in B is a classic example used to determine *endo* stereochemistry, directly probing the spatial relationship between the original diene and dienophile components.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me(bridgehead)) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me(vinyl)): These are on adjacent carbons and are close in both isomers.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most defining NOE cross-peak that distinguishes the major (*endo*) from the minor (*exo*) product is the one between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride.\n        *   **1H NMR of Anhydride:** A single peak at 7 ppm. This chemical shift is in the vinylic/aromatic region. A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n        *   **13C NMR of Anhydride:** Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). The presence of only two peaks also indicates high molecular symmetry.\n        *   The only common structure that fits this data is **maleic anhydride**, formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinylic protons (giving a singlet at ~7.0 ppm) and two sets of equivalent carbons (two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons), consistent with the NMR data.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The second reactant is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a conjugated diene substituted with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n    *   The molecular formula of the diene is C9H14, and the anhydride is C4H2O3. The adduct's formula is C13H16O3, which matches the problem statement.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two main stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which correspond to these two isomers.\n\n3.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry):**\n    *   The *endo* rule states that the kinetically favored (usually major) product is the one where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are oriented under the newly forming ring (syn to the longer bridge).\n    *   **However, this rule is often reversed by significant steric hindrance.** In this case, the diene has methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). In the *endo* approach, the maleic anhydride moiety would clash sterically with these methyl groups.\n    *   In the *exo* approach, the anhydride is oriented away from these methyl groups, resulting in a much less sterically hindered transition state.\n    *   Therefore, due to overwhelming steric hindrance, the **major product will be the *exo* isomer**, and the **minor product will be the *endo* isomer**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures and Predicted NMR Signals:**\n    *   Let's visualize the two products and identify the key proton groups. Both products are highly symmetrical.\n        *   **H-anhydride:** The two protons on the anhydride part of the skeleton (at positions C2 and C3). They are equivalent due to symmetry in both isomers. They are alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained ring, so a chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable. This would be a **2H singlet**.\n        *   **Me-alkene:** The two methyl groups on the C=C double bond (at C5 and C6). They are equivalent. As vinylic methyl groups, their shift would be around **~1.7 ppm**. This would be a **6H singlet**.\n        *   **Me-bridgehead:** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (at C1 and C4). They are also equivalent. Being on a saturated, quaternary carbon, they would be more shielded, with a shift likely around **~1.0 ppm**. This would be another **6H singlet**.\n        *   (Note: The protons on the C7 bridge are not relevant to the options provided).\n\n5.  **Correlate Structure with NOESY Data:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n    *   The problem states: A cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**.\n    *   Since we determined that **Major = *exo*** and **Minor = *endo***, we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* isomer but far apart in the *endo* isomer.\n\n    *   Let's examine the spatial relationships:\n        *   ***Exo* isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C5=C6 double bond. This brings the **H-anhydride protons** (~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the **Me-alkene groups** (~1.7 ppm). **A strong NOE cross-peak is expected.**\n        *   ***Endo* isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C5=C6 double bond (it is *syn* to the C7 bridge). The H-anhydride protons and the Me-alkene groups are far apart. **No significant NOE is expected.**\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The observed NOE cross-peak, which is present only in the major product, must connect the H-anhydride protons and the Me-alkene protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignments, these correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a very simple NMR spectrum:\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent protons on a double bond. The downfield shift to 7 ppm is characteristic of vinyl protons attached to electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).\n    *   These data perfectly match the structure of **maleic anhydride**. It is symmetrical, so the two vinyl protons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, as are the two vinyl carbons.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a new six-membered ring, resulting in a bicyclic adduct.\n\n**3. Address the Molecular Formula Discrepancy**\n\n*   Let's calculate the molecular formula of the expected Diels-Alder product:\n    *   Maleic anhydride: C₄H₂O₃\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene: C₉H₁₂\n    *   Diels-Alder Adduct: C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₂ = **C₁₃H₁₄O₃**\n*   The problem states the products have a molecular formula of **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This differs by two hydrogen atoms (H₂), suggesting a reduction (hydrogenation) of a double bond might have occurred after the Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   However, let's analyze the consequences. If the product were reduced, the characteristic NOE pattern that distinguishes *endo* and *exo* Diels-Alder products would be altered in a way that contradicts the problem statement (this will be shown below). It is most likely that the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ is a typo in the question and we should proceed by analyzing the direct Diels-Alder adducts (C₁₃H₁₄O₃), as this leads to a logical and consistent answer.\n\n**4. Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   **Endo Rule:** In most Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is formed faster and is the **major product** (kinetic control). The *exo* product is usually more stable but forms slower, making it the **minor product**.\n    *   **Endo Adduct:** The electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride part) is oriented \"under\" the π-system of the newly formed ring (originally the diene).\n    *   **Exo Adduct:** The anhydride part is oriented \"away\" from the π-system.\n\n*   Let's visualize the structures:\n    *   **Major Product (Endo):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C=C bridge that bears the four methyl groups. The two protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) are spatially close to the methyl groups on the double bond (let's call them Me_vinyl).\n    *   **Minor Product (Exo):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C=C bridge. The H_anhydride protons are far from the Me_vinyl groups.\n\n**5. Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\"\n*   Based on our structural analysis:\n    *   In the **major (endo) product**, the H_anhydride protons and the Me_vinyl groups are close. A NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n    *   In the **minor (exo) product**, these protons are far apart. No significant NOESY cross-peak is expected.\n*   This perfectly matches the experimental observation. Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product is between the H_anhydride protons and the Me_vinyl protons.\n\n**6. Assign the NMR Resonances**\n\n*   We now need to assign the signals described in the answer choices to the protons in our structure.\n    *   **H_anhydride:** These are two equivalent protons (due to symmetry) on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. They are deshielded and should appear as a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Me_vinyl:** These are four methyl groups attached to the double bond. By symmetry, they fall into two sets of two. However, in many similar systems, the difference is small, and they might appear as a single peak. The question describes them as singlets. Let's look closer: there are two methyls on the \"front\" of the double bond (e.g., C1, C4) and two on the \"back\" (C2, C3 of the original diene). The adduct has C2v symmetry. The methyls at C1 and C4 of the diene become the bridgehead methyls. The methyls at C2 and C3 of the diene remain on the double bond of the product. The problem simplifies this by referring to the signals for the products. Let's re-examine the diene: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The product is 1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n        *   The methyls at positions 1 and 4 are bridgehead methyls. They are on saturated carbons. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**. They should be a **6H singlet at ~1.0-1.5 ppm**.\n        *   The methyls at positions 5 and 6 are on the double bond. Let's call them **Me_vinyl**. They are deshielded relative to the bridgehead methyls. They should be a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   The key NOE is between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl.\n*   The corresponding signals are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\n**7. Match with the Options**\n\n*   Let's review the options based on our assignments:\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl)\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride)\n    *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (likely a bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride)\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (likely a bridge proton)\n\nOur analysis shows the cross-peak connects the resonances for Me_vinyl and H_anhydride. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\ntrl95>He\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride:** The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. Upon dehydration, it forms an anhydride with a very simple NMR spectrum:\n    *   ¹H NMR: one singlet at 7.0 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent and are in the vinylic region.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons, C=O).\n    *   The only molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry that makes the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, resulting in the simple spectra described.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene (C₉H₁₄) that is substituted with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product would be the sum of the reactants: C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product. According to the Alder rule, the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored product and is therefore the **major product**. The *exo* product is the thermodynamically favored but kinetically slower-forming product, making it the **minor product**.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Major and Minor Products**\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products. The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n\n*   **Common features of both isomers:**\n    *   A C=C double bond with two methyl groups attached (from C2 and C3 of the diene). Let's call these **vinylic methyls**.\n    *   Two bridgehead carbons, each with a methyl group attached (from C1 and C4 of the diene). Let's call these **bridgehead methyls**.\n    *   A fused anhydride ring (from maleic anhydride). The two protons on the carbons where the ring is fused originate from the maleic anhydride. Let's call these **anhydride protons**.\n    *   A one-carbon bridge (a CH₂ group from C5 of the diene).\n\n*   **Key stereochemical difference:**\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C=C double bond bridge. The anhydride protons point \"under\" the C=C bridge.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C=C double bond bridge.\n\nBoth products possess a plane of symmetry that passes through the CH₂ bridge and the oxygen of the anhydride. This means that in both isomers:\n*   The two vinylic methyl groups are equivalent.\n*   The two bridgehead methyl groups are equivalent.\n*   The two anhydride protons are equivalent.\n\n**4. Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on typical chemical shifts, we can assign the signals mentioned in the options to the different types of protons in the product:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Protons on carbons adjacent to two carbonyl groups (the anhydride protons) are highly deshielded. This is a very characteristic shift.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinylic methyls) typically appear around 1.6-2.0 ppm.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Methyl groups on saturated carbons (bridgehead methyls) typically appear around 0.8-1.2 ppm.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This must be one of the two protons on the CH₂ bridge. These two protons are diastereotopic (not equivalent) and would couple to each other, forming two doublets (an AB system, which can look like two doublets if Δν >> J).\n\n**5. Analyze the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (through-space interaction, not through bonds). A cross-peak connects the signals of two protons that are spatially near (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the **major** product but absent/weak in the **minor** product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   **In the Endo (Major) Product:**\n    *   The anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are positioned directly under the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). They are very close in space.\n    *   Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl protons** is expected.\n\n*   **In the Exo (Minor) Product:**\n    *   The anhydride ring is flipped away from the vinylic methyl groups. The distance between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons is now large.\n    *   Therefore, the NOE cross-peak between these two groups would be absent or very weak.\n    *   (In the *exo* product, a new NOE between the anhydride protons and the bridgehead methyls (~1.0 ppm) would appear, as these groups are now close).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak that is strong in the major product and absent/weak in the minor product is the one connecting the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl protons**.\n*   Signal for vinylic methyl protons: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n*   Signal for anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n\nThis corresponds to the pair of resonances described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   **The Dienophile:** We start with a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. Dehydration of this acid yields an anhydride.\n        *   The anhydride's 1H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7.0 ppm. This indicates that all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent. A chemical shift of 7.0 ppm is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The fact that they are equivalent suggests a high degree of symmetry.\n        *   The anhydride's 13C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon region) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon region). This indicates there are only two types of carbon atoms.\n        *   The only structure that fits all this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). It has two equivalent vinylic protons (which give the singlet at ~7 ppm) and two types of carbons: two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n    *   **The Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds (a cyclopentadiene core).\n        *   Methyl groups are attached to all four carbons involved in the double bonds (positions 1, 2, 3, and 4).\n        *   The fifth carbon of the ring is a CH2 group.\n        *   The structure is symmetrical.\n\n*   **Step 2: The Reaction and Products.**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition typically produces two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** adduct and the ***exo*** adduct.\n    *   According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* product is formed faster and is usually the **major product** under kinetic control. The *exo* product is more thermodynamically stable and would be the minor product.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3, which is consistent with the sum of the reactants' formulas (Diene C9H14 + Dienophile C4H2O3 = C13H16O3).\n    *   Both the *endo* and *exo* products are bicyclic compounds (specifically, they are derivatives of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene). Both products possess a plane of symmetry, making them achiral (meso compounds).\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of the Products.**\n    *   Due to the plane of symmetry in both products, the number of distinct proton signals is reduced. We expect four signals:\n        1.  **H_anhydride:** The two protons on the part of the structure derived from maleic anhydride. They are equivalent. Expected signal: a **2H singlet**. Based on similar structures, their chemical shift should be downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        2.  **Me_alkene:** The two methyl groups attached to the double bond of the bicyclic system. They are equivalent. Expected signal: a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift should be typical for vinylic methyls, around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        3.  **Me_bridgehead:** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. They are equivalent. Expected signal: a **6H singlet**. They are on quaternary saturated carbons and should be relatively upfield, around ~1.0 ppm.\n        4.  **CH2_bridge:** The two protons of the CH2 bridge. They are enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry and thus are NMR-equivalent. Expected signal: a **2H singlet**, likely between 1.5-2.0 ppm.\n\n*   **Step 4: Interpret the NOESY Spectrum.**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This must be due to a difference in spatial proximity between the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) isomers.\n    *   Let's visualize the stereochemistry:\n        *   In the ***endo*** **(major) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked *under* the newly formed six-membered ring, on the same side as the C7-CH2 bridge. In this orientation, the `H_anhydride` protons are brought into close proximity with the methyl groups on the double bond (`Me_alkene`).\n        *   In the ***exo*** **(minor) product**, the anhydride ring points *away* from the C7-CH2 bridge. In this orientation, the `H_anhydride` protons are far from the `Me_alkene` groups.\n    *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product must be the one connecting the `H_anhydride` protons and the `Me_alkene` protons.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the Resonances to the Options.**\n    *   The key NOE is between the `H_anhydride` protons (a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and the `Me_alkene` protons (a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm).\n    *   Let's examine the choices:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect signal types and resonances.\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect signal type.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be an NOE between `Me_bridgehead` and `Me_alkene`. This proximity exists in both isomers, so it wouldn't be the differentiating peak.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This corresponds exactly to the `Me_alkene` and `H_anhydride` protons. The chemical shifts are reasonable, the signal types match our analysis, and this NOE is characteristic of the major (*endo*) product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   The first reactant is an anhydride derived from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The NMR data provided for this anhydride (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   The single ¹H peak at 7 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent vinylic protons.\n        *   The ¹³C peak at ~137 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent alkene carbons, and the peak at ~165 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n        *   The *cis* geometry of the precursor (maleic acid) is necessary to form the cyclic anhydride upon dehydration.\n\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a conjugated diene.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The *endo* product is usually the major product formed under kinetic control due to favorable secondary orbital interactions, while the *exo* product is the minor (and usually more thermodynamically stable) product. The question explicitly states a major and a minor product are formed.\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of the resulting bicyclic adduct. The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene derivative.\n        *   The cyclopentadiene provides the C1-C4 and C7 carbons of the bicyclic system. The methyl groups from the diene are located at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and the vinylic positions (C2, C3). The methylene group (CH₂) of the diene becomes the C7 bridge.\n        *   The maleic anhydride moiety fuses to the C5 and C6 positions. The two protons from the maleic anhydride are now attached to C5 and C6.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify:\n        *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) → Adduct (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). This matches the given formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and the NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   The key difference between the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products lies in the spatial arrangement of the fused anhydride ring. A NOESY spectrum shows through-space correlations (Nuclear Overhauser Effect) between protons that are close to each other (< 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates the corresponding protons are in close proximity.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor product. This means we must find a pair of proton groups that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n    *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C2=C3 double bond. In this conformation, the protons on the anhydride ring (at C5 and C6) are spatially close to the methyl groups attached to the double bond (the vinylic methyls at C2 and C3).\n\n    *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented away from the C2=C3 double bond. In this conformation, the protons at C5 and C6 are far from the vinylic methyl groups at C2 and C3.\n\n    *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product must be the one connecting the **protons at C5/C6** and the **vinylic methyl groups at C2/C3**.\n\n4.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Resonances:**\n    *   Due to a plane of symmetry in both isomers, pairs of groups are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Protons at C5 and C6:** These two protons are equivalent. They are on sp³ carbons, but they are alpha to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups in the anhydride ring. This deshielding effect will shift their resonance significantly downfield. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is very reasonable for these protons. Since they are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with (C1 and C4 have methyl groups, not protons), they will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **Vinylic Methyl Groups (at C2 and C3):** These two methyl groups are equivalent. They are attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. A typical chemical shift for vinylic methyls is in the range of 1.6-2.0 ppm. Therefore, the signal at **~1.7 ppm** is the correct assignment. As they are equivalent, they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyl Groups (at C1 and C4):** These two methyl groups are also equivalent. They are attached to saturated tertiary carbons. Their chemical shift would be further upfield, around **~1.0-1.2 ppm**. The **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm** in option D corresponds to this group.\n    *   The \"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\" mentioned in options A and B does not correspond to any of the major symmetric groups and likely represents one of the non-equivalent methylene bridge protons at C7.\n\n5.  **Identify the Correct Answer:**\n    *   The key NOE cross-peak connects the protons at C5/C6 and the vinylic methyl groups at C2/C3.\n    *   Based on our assignment, this corresponds to the cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\nLet's review the choices:\nA) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. (Incorrect group)\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. (Incorrect groups; NOE between bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton would not be the defining difference)\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. (This correctly identifies the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons, which show the characteristic NOE difference between endo and exo isomers).\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. (This would be an NOE between bridgehead and vinylic methyls, which should be present in both isomers).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride.\n        *   ¹H NMR of the anhydride: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. A signal at ~7 ppm is typical for vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond) that are deshielded by adjacent electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   ¹³C NMR of the anhydride: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).\n        *   The simplest structure fitting this data is **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent vinylic protons (explaining the single ¹H peak) and two types of equivalent carbons (two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons), explaining the two ¹³C peaks. Maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid) is the corresponding *cis*-dicarboxylic acid.\n\n        ```\n             O\n            // \\\n           C   C=O\n          / \\ /\n        H--C=C--H\n        Maleic Anhydride\n        ```\n\n    *   **Diene:** The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with four methyl groups on the conjugated double bond system (C1-C4) and a CH₂ group at C5.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n3.  **Predict the Products and their Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The stereochemistry of the addition can be either *endo* or *exo*.\n    *   The **endo rule** for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions states that the major product results from the orientation where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are positioned under the newly formed ring, allowing for stabilizing secondary orbital overlap. In this case, the anhydride part of the dienophile will be oriented towards the C=C double bond of the resulting bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   Therefore:\n        *   **Major product = *endo* adduct**\n        *   **Minor product = *exo* adduct**\n    *   The molecular formula of the products is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 3D Structures and NMR Spectra:**\n    *   The problem relies on a 2D NOESY NMR experiment. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The key information is: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor product.\"\n    *   This means we must find a pair of protons that are spatially close in the *endo* isomer (major) but far apart in the *exo* isomer (minor).\n    *   Let's identify the proton signals based on the provided options and general chemical shift knowledge. Both isomers have a plane of symmetry, simplifying the spectra.\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride). They are on carbons C2 and C3 of the bicyclic system.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (the vinylic methyls on C5 and C6).\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4).\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7).\n\n5.  **Correlate Structure with NOESY Data:**\n    *   Let's examine the spatial relationships in the two isomers.\n\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** The anhydride group (and its protons, H_anhydride) is oriented \"endo,\" meaning it points towards the C5=C6 double bond. This brings the H_anhydride protons very close to the vinylic methyl groups attached to C5 and C6. A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two groups of protons.\n\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** The anhydride group (and H_anhydride) is oriented \"exo,\" meaning it points away from the C5=C6 double bond. The distance between the H_anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups is now significantly larger. The NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n    *   This analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem. The cross-peak that distinguishes the major from the minor product is the one between the H_anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   The H_anhydride protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The vinylic methyl protons correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak connects these two signals.\n\n    Let's check the options again:\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm -> Bridgehead Me and Bridge CH. Distances likely similar in both isomers.\n    B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm -> Bridgehead Me and Vinyl Me. Distances are fixed by the rigid frame and are identical in both isomers.\n    C) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** -> Vinyl Me and H_anhydride. Close in endo, far in exo. This is the correct answer.\n    D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> Bridge CH and H_anhydride. These are actually closer in the *exo* (minor) isomer than in the *endo* isomer. This is the opposite of the observation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a chemical reaction and the spectroscopic data of its products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene:** The simplest such acid is *cis*-butenedioic acid, commonly known as maleic acid.\n    *   **Dehydration to an anhydride:** Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride. Let's verify the NMR data provided for this anhydride.\n        *   Structure: Maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring containing an oxygen atom, two carbonyl (C=O) groups, and a C=C double bond. The structure is planar and symmetrical.\n        *   ¹H NMR: Due to the plane of symmetry, the two protons on the double bond are chemically equivalent. Therefore, they should produce a single peak. The problem states a single peak at 7 ppm, which is a typical chemical shift for vinylic protons deshielded by adjacent carbonyl groups. This matches maleic anhydride.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: There are two distinct types of carbon atoms. The two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, and the two alkene carbons are equivalent. This should result in two signals. The problem states two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons), which are characteristic shifts for these functional groups. This confirms the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **The other reactant:** The problem states the anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The cyclopentadiene provides the 4-π electron system, and the double bond of maleic anhydride provides the 2-π electron system.\n    *   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n        *   ***Endo* product:** The electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is oriented on the same side as the newly formed double bond bridge. This is typically the kinetically favored and therefore the **major product**.\n        *   ***Exo* product:** The anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side of the double bond bridge. This is typically the thermodynamically more stable but kinetically disfavored, and therefore the **minor product**.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Check:**\n        *   Diene (C9H14) + Dienophile (C4H2O3) → Adduct (C13H16O3). This matches the formula provided in the problem.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Structures and NMR Spectra:**\n    *   We need to find a feature in the 2D NOESY spectrum that distinguishes the major (*endo*) from the minor (*exo*) product. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (typically < 5 Å). We are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   **Let's visualize the structures:**\n        *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond of the bicyclic system. This brings the two protons from the maleic anhydride moiety very close to the two vinyl methyl groups on that C=C bond.\n        *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the C=C double bond. In this conformation, the anhydride protons are far from the vinyl methyl groups.\n    *   **The Key NOESY Correlation:** The spatial proximity between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl groups is unique to the *endo* isomer. Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between the signals for these two groups of protons will be present (or strong) in the spectrum of the major product (*endo*) and absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor product (*exo*).\n\n4.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product molecule has a plane of symmetry, simplifying the spectrum.\n    *   **Vinyl methyl groups:** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. They will appear as a 6H singlet. Being allylic, their typical chemical shift is around 1.5-2.0 ppm. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is the best fit.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** These are two equivalent methyl groups on saturated, quaternary bridgehead carbons. They are in a shielded environment and will appear as a 6H singlet at a higher field (lower ppm). The **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** is the best fit for these.\n    *   **Anhydride protons:** These are two equivalent protons, each adjacent to two carbonyl groups. They are heavily deshielded and will appear as a 2H singlet. Their chemical shift will be far downfield. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the best fit.\n    *   **Methylene bridge protons:** These two protons are diastereotopic (non-equivalent) and couple to each other, forming two doublets (an AB quartet). One of these would correspond to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Identify the Cross-Peak:**\n    *   Based on our analysis, the cross-peak that distinguishes the major product is between the **anhydride protons** and the **vinyl methyl groups**.\n    *   Using our signal assignments:\n        *   Anhydride protons = 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   Vinyl methyl groups = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl Me). Incorrect.\n    *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge CH) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride H). This interaction would be stronger in the *exo* product. Incorrect.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge CH). Incorrect.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl Me) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride H). **Correct**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has key NMR features: a single proton peak at 7 ppm (¹H NMR) and two carbon peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm (¹³C NMR).\n        *   A single ¹H peak at 7.0 ppm suggests two chemically equivalent protons on a double bond.\n        *   A ¹³C peak at 137 ppm is characteristic of sp² carbons in a double bond (C=C).\n        *   A ¹³C peak at 165 ppm is characteristic of carbonyl carbons (C=O) in an anhydride.\n        *   The simplest molecule fitting this description is **maleic anhydride** (derived from *cis*-butenedioic acid, i.e., maleic acid). It has C₂ᵥ symmetry, making the two vinyl protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. The chemical shifts provided are consistent with this structure.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with a five-membered ring. Four methyl groups are on the four carbons of the conjugated diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4), and a CH₂ group is at C5. This molecule also possesses C₂ᵥ symmetry.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   This reaction is stereospecific. When a cyclic diene reacts with a dienophile, two stereoisomeric products can be formed: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** The Diels-Alder reaction is typically under kinetic control, meaning the product that forms faster is the major product. The *endo* adduct is formed faster due to favorable secondary orbital interactions between the π-system of the diene and the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile. Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structures of the Products:**\n    *   The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton.\n    *   Let's visualize the structures of the endo and exo products. The product is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the newly formed six-membered ring, placing it on the opposite side of the CH₂ bridge (the C7 bridge). This means the anhydride part is spatially close to the double bond (C2=C3) and the methyl groups attached to it.\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"above\" the newly formed six-membered ring, placing it on the same side as the CH₂ bridge. This means the anhydride part is spatially far from the double bond and its methyl groups, but close to the CH₂ bridge.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY NMR Data:**\n    *   A 2D NOESY experiment shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the **major product** but absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the **minor product**.\n    *   This means we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n    *   From our structural analysis:\n        *   In the **endo (major)** product, the protons on the anhydride part (let's call them Hₐ, at positions C5 and C6) are close to the vinylic methyl groups (Meᵥ, at C2 and C3).\n        *   In the **exo (minor)** product, the protons Hₐ are far from the vinylic methyl groups Meᵥ. (Instead, in the exo product, Hₐ would be close to the CH₂ bridge protons).\n    *   Therefore, the unique cross-peak observed in the major product connects the resonances of protons **Hₐ** and the **vinylic methyl groups Meᵥ**.\n\n5.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Resonances:**\n    *   We need to assign the chemical shifts and integrals provided in the options to the different types of protons in the product molecule. The total proton count is 16 (2 from anhydride + 14 from diene).\n    *   **Protons on the anhydride part (Hₐ):** These are two equivalent protons (due to symmetry) on sp³ carbons alpha to carbonyl groups. Their chemical shift should be in the range of 3.0-4.0 ppm. They will appear as a **2H singlet** (or a simple multiplet).\n    *   **Vinylic methyl groups (Meᵥ):** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. Their chemical shift is typically around 1.6-2.0 ppm. They will appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl groups (Meₑₕ):** These are two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These carbons are sterically hindered, and the methyl groups are usually shielded, appearing at a lower chemical shift, around 0.8-1.3 ppm. They will appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Methylene bridge protons (Hₑ):** These two protons at C7 are not equivalent (diastereotopic). They will likely appear as two separate signals (e.g., a pair of doublets due to geminal coupling), integrating to 1H each. Their shifts can vary, but ~1.5 ppm is a reasonable value for one of them.\n\n6.  **Match the Analysis with the Given Options:**\n    *   The cross-peak in the major product is between Hₐ and Meᵥ.\n    *   Our assignment for Hₐ is a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   Our assignment for Meᵥ is a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Meₑₕ) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (one Hₑ proton). This interaction should be present in both isomers.\n        *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Meᵥ) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Hₐ).** This matches our prediction perfectly. This interaction is unique to the endo (major) product.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Meₑₕ) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Meᵥ). This interaction should be present in both isomers as the groups are on adjacent carbons.\n        *   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (one Hₑ proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Hₐ). This interaction would be strong in the exo (minor) product, which is the opposite of what is observed.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects the 6H singlet of the vinylic methyls (~1.7 ppm) and the 2H singlet of the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is key:\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. A signal in this region is typical for vinylic protons (H-C=C-H). A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon, C=O).\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. The chemical shifts are characteristic for this compound.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a C₅ ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 and 3, and a methyl group on each of carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. The C5 carbon is a CH₂ group, but this is an error in typical representation, since C1-C4 have methyls, C5 is just a carbon atom with 2 hydrogens. A quick check of the formula shows: C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n    *   The product is a bicyclic compound. The core structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene system.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula of the product:\n        *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃).\n        *   This matches the molecular formula given in the problem.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (Major and Minor Products)**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** Typically, the major product is the *endo* adduct, formed faster (kinetic product) due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. The minor product is the *exo* adduct, which is usually more stable (thermodynamic product).\n    *   **Steric Effects:** However, the diene used here, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. The four methyl groups create significant steric hindrance. In an *endo* approach, the anhydride ring would be positioned under the diene, leading to severe steric clashes with the methyl groups. In an *exo* approach, the anhydride points away, which is sterically much more favorable.\n    *   For highly substituted dienes like this, it's very common for steric hindrance to override the electronic preference, making the **exo adduct the major product**.\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude:\n        *   **Major Product = *exo* adduct**\n        *   **Minor Product = *endo* adduct**\n\n4.  **Analyze the 3D Structure and NOESY Spectra**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect SpectroscopY) detects protons that are close in space (< ~5 Å). The problem states there is a cross-peak in the major product's spectrum that is absent in the minor one. We need to find an interaction unique to the *exo* adduct.\n    *   Let's analyze the proton positions in each adduct:\n        *   **Major (*exo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the *exo* face (away from the C7 bridge). This means the two protons on the anhydride part of the ring (let's call them **H-anhydride**) are oriented on the **endo** face, tucked \"under\" the newly formed six-membered ring.\n        *   **Minor (*endo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the *endo* face. The **H-anhydride** protons are on the **exo** face.\n    *   Now, let's identify key spatial proximities:\n        *   In the **major (*exo*) adduct**, the **endo-oriented H-anhydride protons** are very close to the **vinylic methyl groups** (the ones on the C=C double bond). A strong NOE is expected between them.\n        *   In the **minor (*endo*) adduct**, the **exo-oriented H-anhydride protons** are far from the vinylic methyl groups. No NOE is expected between them.\n    *   This perfectly explains the observation: an NOE cross-peak between the H-anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons will be present in the major (*exo*) product and absent in the minor (*endo*) product.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option**\n    *   We need to assign the chemical shifts to the protons involved in this distinguishing NOE.\n        *   **H-anhydride protons:** These are two equivalent protons on sp³ carbons adjacent to two carbonyl groups in a rigid bicyclic system. Their chemical shift is typically downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**. They are equivalent, so they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n        *   **Vinylic methyl groups:** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to a double bond (-C=C-CH₃). Their chemical shift is typically around **~1.7 ppm**. They are equivalent and each is a CH₃, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n        *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** These are two equivalent methyl groups on quaternary sp³ carbons. They are more shielded and appear at a higher field (lower ppm), typically around **~1.0 ppm**. They would also be a **6H singlet**.\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak connects the H-anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) and the vinylic methyl protons (~1.7 ppm).\n    *   Let's examine the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n        *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n    *   Option A perfectly matches our deduction: a cross-peak between the 6H singlet of the vinylic methyls (~1.7 ppm) and the 2H singlet of the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1.

Analyze the Reaction and Products\n\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction** between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   This reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Due to the stereochemistry of the approach of the dienophile to the diene, two main stereoisomers can be formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the *endo* adduct is kinetically favored and is therefore the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is thermodynamically more stable but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Structures of the Major and Minor Products\n\n*   **Endo Product (Major):** In the Diels-Alder reaction with cyclopentadiene derivatives, the *endo* configuration means the substituents from the dienophile are on the same side (*syn*) as the one-carbon bridge (the C7 bridge). In this case, the anhydride ring is tucked under the C7 bridge. This places the two protons that were originally on the maleic anhydride (let's call them H_a) on the outer, convex face of the molecule.\n*   **Exo Product (Minor):** The *exo* configuration means the substituents from the dienophile are on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. The anhydride ring points away from the C7 bridge. This places the H_a protons on the inner, concave face of the molecule, close to the C7 bridge.\n\nLet's visualize the key protons/groups in the major (*endo*) product:\n\n```\n      Major (Endo) Product         \n                                      \n             Me   Me  <-- Vinylic Methyls (~1.7 ppm)\n              \\   /                      \n               C=C                       \n              /   \\                      \n      Me----C-------C----Me  <-- Bridgehead Methyls (~1.0 ppm)\n           / \\     / \\                    \n         Ha--C-------C--Ha   <-- Anhydride Protons (~3.5 ppm)\n             \\  \\ /  /                    \n              \\  O  /                     \n               \\ | /\n              O=C-C=O\n                 |\n             C₇H₂ Bridge (behind)\n```\n\nIn the *endo* (major) product, the anhydride protons (H_a) are on the same face as the vinylic methyl groups. They are spatially close.\n\n### 4. Interpret the NOESY Spectra\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å), causing a cross-peak between their signals.\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor product. We need to find an interaction that is unique to the *endo* isomer.\n*   **In the major (endo) product:** The anhydride protons (H_a) and the vinylic methyl groups are on the same convex face of the molecule. Their proximity will generate a strong NOE cross-peak.\n*   **In the minor (exo) product:** The anhydride protons (H_a) are on the concave face, while the vinylic methyl groups are on the convex face. They are far apart, so there will be no NOE cross-peak between them. Instead, H_a protons would be close to the C7 bridge protons in the exo isomer.\n*   Therefore, the differentiating cross-peak connects the anhydride protons (H_a) and the vinylic methyl groups.\n\n### 5. Assign NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option\n\nNow, let's assign the chemical shifts (ppm) to the relevant proton groups based on typical values:\n\n*   **Anhydride Protons (H_a):** These two protons are on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring system. Their chemical shift will be relatively high. A value of **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable. They are chemically equivalent due to a plane of symmetry, so they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n*   **Vinylic Methyls:** These are methyl groups attached to a C=C double bond. A typical chemical shift is **~1.7 ppm**. There are two such groups, and they are equivalent, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyls:** These are methyl groups on saturated, quaternary carbons. A typical shift is **~1.0 ppm**. There are two such groups, and they are equivalent, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n*   **C7 Bridge Protons:** These are two protons on a methylene bridge in a strained bicyclic system. Their shift would be around **~1.5 ppm**. (The \"1H doublet\" in the options is likely a simplification or refers to a potential loss of symmetry, but it is not relevant for identifying the correct NOE pair).\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons. Based on our assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between:\n*   The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (vinylic methyls)\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (anhydride protons)\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nC) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\nOption D perfectly matches our conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene. Dehydration forms an anhydride.\n    *   **NMR of Anhydride:**\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak means all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl).\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).\n    *   These spectral data perfectly match **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making its two vinylic protons equivalent (a singlet at ~7.0-7.3 ppm) and its two carbonyl carbons equivalent (~165 ppm) and its two vinylic carbons equivalent (~137 ppm).\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4) and methyl groups attached to each of these four carbons. The fifth carbon (C5) is a -CH₂- group.\n\n2.  **The Reaction: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a **bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene** derivative.\n    *   The reaction produces two stereoisomers: the **endo** and **exo** products. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry: Endo vs. Exo Selectivity**\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** Typically, Diels-Alder reactions favor the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. This would make the *endo* product the major kinetic product.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** However, the diene used here is extremely bulky. It has four methyl groups on the reacting carbon atoms (C1, C2, C3, C4). This significant steric hindrance can override the electronic preference for the *endo* transition state, making the less hindered *exo* pathway faster.\n    *   Therefore, in this specific case, it is very likely that the **exo product is the major product** (kinetic control) and the **endo product is the minor product**.\n\n4.  **Structure of the Products and NOESY Analysis**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows a cross-peak between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* adduct (major) but far apart in the *endo* adduct (minor).\n    *   Let's analyze the proton signals and their positions in the two isomers.\n        *   **Product Protons:**\n            *   **Vinylic methyls (Me_vinyl):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the newly formed C=C bond. (6H singlet). Expected shift ~1.7 ppm.\n            *   **Bridgehead methyls (Me_bridgehead):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. (6H singlet). Expected shift ~1.0-1.5 ppm.\n            *   **Anhydride protons (H_anhydride):** Two equivalent protons on the carbons originating from maleic anhydride. They are alpha to carbonyls. (2H singlet). Expected shift ~3.0-4.0 ppm.\n            *   **Methylene bridge protons:** Two protons on the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Spatial Proximity in Isomers:**\n        *   **Exo Adduct (Major):** In the *exo* structure, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the C7 bridge. This places its two protons (**H_anhydride**) on the *endo* face of the molecule, pointing \"underneath\" the C=C double bond. This brings them very close to the **vinylic methyl groups (Me_vinyl)**. A strong NOE is expected between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl**.\n        *   **Endo Adduct (Minor):** In the *endo* structure, the anhydride ring points towards the C7 bridge. This places its two protons (**H_anhydride**) on the *exo* face, pointing \"away\" from the C=C double bond and its methyl groups. They are far apart. The NOE between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** would be absent or very weak.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The cross-peak that is present in the major product (exo) but absent in the minor product (endo) must be between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n    *   Let's match these protons to the options provided:\n        *   **Anhydride protons (H_anhydride):** A 2H singlet at a downfield shift, ~3.5 ppm is a very reasonable assignment.\n        *   **Vinylic methyl protons (Me_vinyl):** A 6H singlet around ~1.7 ppm is a very reasonable assignment.\n    *   Now we check the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm -> Incorrect protons/multiplicity.\n        *   B) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** -> This perfectly matches our prediction for the NOE between Me_vinyl and H_anhydride in the major (exo) product.\n        *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> Incorrect protons/multiplicity.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm -> This would be an NOE between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. This interaction would likely exist in both isomers and is not the key distinguishing feature.\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single 1H NMR peak at 7 ppm (alkene region) and two 13C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl C).\n        *   The single 1H peak indicates that the two alkene protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   The two 13C peaks indicate two types of equivalent carbons.\n        *   This data is perfectly consistent with **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by dehydrating *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, matching the NMR data.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   The structure is a five-membered ring with a CH₂ group at C5 and conjugated double bonds at C1=C2 and C3=C4. Each of the four sp² carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) bears a methyl group.\n        *   The molecular formula of the diene is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile.\n    *   The total molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions typically yield two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to these two isomers.\n    *   According to the **Alder endo rule**, the transition state leading to the *endo* product is kinetically favored due to secondary orbital interactions. Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* isomer**, and the **minor product is the *exo* isomer**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry and Structure of the Products:**\n    *   The product has a **bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene** core structure.\n    *   We need to determine the relative positions of the substituents in the *endo* and *exo* isomers to understand their 3D structure and predict NOESY correlations.\n    *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** In the *endo* transition state, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are positioned \"under\" the diene's π-system. In the resulting product, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the six-membered ring from the C7 bridge (the former CH₂ group of the diene). This means the two protons attached to the anhydride-derived part of the skeleton (let's call them H_anhydride, at positions C5 and C6) point *towards* the C7 bridge. They are also situated underneath the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** In the *exo* product, the anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge. The H_anhydride protons point *away* from the C7 bridge.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Assign Proton Signals and Evaluate Spatial Proximities:**\n    *   Based on typical chemical shifts, we can assign the signals mentioned in the options:\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Vinylic methyl groups on C2 and C3 (**Me_vinyl**). They are equivalent due to symmetry.\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Bridgehead methyl groups on C1 and C4 (**Me_bridgehead**). Also equivalent.\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Protons on the anhydride part (**H_anhydride** at C5 and C6). They are α to carbonyls and equivalent.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This describes one of the two diastereotopic protons of the C7 bridge (**H_bridge**). Let's call them H7_syn and H7_anti. They couple to each other, so they appear as two doublets. This resonance represents one of them.\n\n    *   Now, let's analyze the spatial proximities for the NOE interaction unique to the major (*endo*) product.\n\n    *   **In the *endo* (major) isomer:**\n        *   The H_anhydride protons are on the same side as the C7 bridge. Specifically, they are very close to the *anti* proton of the bridge (H7_anti).\n        *   The H_anhydride protons are under the C=C double bond, and thus are relatively far from the Me_vinyl groups.\n\n    *   **In the *exo* (minor) isomer:**\n        *   The H_anhydride protons are on the opposite side of the C7 bridge and are far from its protons.\n        *   The H_anhydride protons are on the same side as the C=C double bond and are close to the Me_vinyl groups.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge):** The bridgehead methyls are close to the C7 bridge in *both* isomers. This NOE is not unique to the major product.\n    *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride):** In the major (*endo*) isomer, the H_anhydride protons are close to the H_bridge protons. In the minor (*exo*) isomer, they are far apart. This matches the condition perfectly.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl):** These adjacent methyl groups are close in *both* isomers. This NOE is not unique to the major product.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride):** These groups are close in the minor (*exo*) isomer, but far apart in the major (*endo*) isomer. This is the opposite of what the question asks for.\n\nConclusion: The only interaction that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product is the one between the bridge protons and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in its ¹³C spectrum.\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Its dehydration product is maleic anhydride.\n    *   Let's check if maleic anhydride's spectral data matches the description. Maleic anhydride has a C₂v symmetry axis.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** The two protons on the double bond are chemically equivalent. They are deshielded by the adjacent electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. A chemical shift around 7 ppm is expected. So, a single peak for these two protons at 7 ppm is consistent with the structure of maleic anhydride.\n        *   **¹³C NMR:** Due to symmetry, there are only two unique carbon environments: the two equivalent olefinic carbons (C=C) and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). Olefinic carbons typically resonate around 100-150 ppm (137 ppm is a good fit), and carbonyl carbons resonate around 160-180 ppm (165 ppm is a good fit).\n    *   Therefore, the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 and 3, methyl groups attached to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a CH₂ group at position 5.\n    *   Molecular formula of maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) + Molecular formula of the diene (C₉H₁₄) gives the product formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   **Stereochemistry and Isomers:** Diels-Alder reactions often produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **endo rule** predicts that the major product is typically the *endo* isomer, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are oriented under the newly formed six-membered ring.\n    *   The *exo* isomer is typically the minor product.\n    *   Thus, the **major product is the *endo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Structure of the Products and Predict NMR Signals**\n\nLet's visualize the structure of the bicyclic adducts and predict their ¹H NMR signals. Both products possess a plane of symmetry that bisects the double bond and the anhydride ring.\n\n*   **Proton Types and Expected Signals:**\n    1.  **Anhydride Protons (H-a):** The two protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. Due to the plane of symmetry, they are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **2H singlet**. Their position, being alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained ring system, would be relatively downfield. The value of **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable.\n    2.  **Vinylic Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the double bond of the newly formed ring. They are equivalent by symmetry. They will appear as a **6H singlet**. Methyl groups on a double bond are typically deshielded compared to those on sp³ carbons. A value of **~1.7 ppm** is a reasonable estimate.\n    3.  **Bridgehead Methyls:** The two methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons. They are also equivalent by symmetry and will appear as a **6H singlet**. These are on saturated (sp³) carbons and should be more shielded (further upfield) than the vinylic methyls. A value of **~1.0 ppm** is plausible.\n    4.  **Methylene Bridge Protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ group that forms the bridge. These two protons are diastereotopic and thus not equivalent. They would likely appear as two separate signals, each coupling with the other (geminal coupling), forming a pair of doublets (an AB system). One of these could correspond to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** mentioned in the options.\n\n**4. Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   **NOESY Principle:** A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected by chemical bonds.\n*   **The Distinguishing Cross-Peak:** The problem states there is a cross-peak present in the major product's spectrum but absent (or weak) in the minor product's spectrum. This means we must find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer (major) but far apart in the *exo* isomer (minor).\n*   **Spatial Analysis of Isomers:**\n    *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond. This geometry brings the **anhydride protons (H-a)** into close spatial proximity with the **vinylic methyl groups**. A strong Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) and thus a strong cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring points away from the C=C double bond. In this arrangement, the **anhydride protons (H-a)** are now far away from the **vinylic methyl groups**. The NOE between them would be very weak or absent.\n\n**5. Match the Interacting Protons to the NMR Signals**\n\n*   The NOESY cross-peak that distinguishes the major and minor products connects the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyls.\n*   From our signal assignment in step 3:\n    *   Anhydride protons = **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n    *   Vinylic methyls = **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n*   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\nThis corresponds perfectly with option A.\n\n*   **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    *   **B) 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This is an interaction between a bridge proton and the anhydride protons. While an interaction might exist, a similar (or even stronger) interaction would also exist in the *exo* isomer, so it would not be a distinguishing peak.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This is between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. They are close in both isomers, so an NOE would be seen in both spectra.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is between the bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton. They are close in both isomers, so an NOE would be seen in both spectra.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which dehydrates to an anhydride. The anhydride has a ¹H NMR spectrum with a single peak at 7 ppm and a ¹³C NMR spectrum with two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   A single ¹H peak suggests the protons are chemically equivalent. The high chemical shift (7 ppm) is characteristic of vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond) that are part of an electron-deficient system.\n    *   Two ¹³C peaks suggest two types of carbon atoms. The peak at 165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl (C=O) carbon in an anhydride. The peak at 137 ppm is in the range for an olefinic (C=C) carbon.\n    *   The simplest molecule fitting this description is **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent vinylic protons (hence one ¹H signal) and two sets of equivalent carbons (two olefinic carbons and two carbonyl carbons, hence two ¹³C signals). Its symmetry and electronic structure perfectly match the provided spectral data.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system where each of the four sp²-hybridized carbons bears a methyl group, and the fifth carbon is a CH₂ group.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\nThe reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a classic [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition. This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Products (Major and Minor)**\n\nThe Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and the *exo* product.\n*   The **endo rule** states that, under kinetic control (which is typical for most Diels-Alder reactions), the major product is the *endo* isomer. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the π-system of the diene and the electron-withdrawing groups (the carbonyls) of the dienophile in the transition state.\n*   The **exo** isomer is usually thermodynamically more stable but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n\nLet's visualize the products:\n*   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene (norbornene) framework.\n*   **Proton/Group Locations:**\n    *   **Vinylic Methyls (Me_V):** Two methyl groups on the double bond of the norbornene ring. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent and appear as a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift should be around 1.7-2.0 ppm.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls (Me_BH):** Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. They are also equivalent by symmetry and appear as another **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically lower, around 1.0-1.3 ppm.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (H_A):** The two protons on the carbons originating from the maleic anhydride. They are equivalent and appear as a **2H singlet**. Being adjacent to carbonyl groups, their shift will be downfield for aliphatic protons, around 3.0-4.0 ppm.\n    *   **Bridge Protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ bridge (C7) are diastereotopic and would likely give two separate signals, possibly coupled to each other.\n\n*   **Structural Difference between *Endo* and *Exo* isomers:**\n    *   In the **endo product (Major)**, the anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond of the norbornene skeleton. This places the anhydride protons (H_A) in close spatial proximity to the vinylic methyl groups (Me_V).\n    *   In the **exo product (Minor)**, the anhydride ring points away from the C=C double bond. This makes the distance between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the vinylic methyl groups (Me_V) much larger.\n\n**4. Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This must correspond to a through-space interaction that is unique to the *endo* (major) isomer.\n*   Based on our structural analysis, the close proximity between the **anhydride protons (H_A)** and the **vinylic methyls (Me_V)** is the defining feature of the *endo* isomer. Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that distinguishes the major product connects these two groups.\n\n**5. Match with the Provided Options**\n\nWe need to find the option that describes the interaction between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the vinylic methyls (Me_V).\n\n*   **Anhydride Protons (H_A):** A 2H singlet with a chemical shift around 3.5 ppm.\n*   **Vinylic Methyls (Me_V):** A 6H singlet with a chemical shift around 1.7 ppm.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This perfectly matches our assignment for the vinylic methyls (Me_V) and the anhydride protons (H_A). The NOE between these two is the key identifier for the major *endo* product.\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This would be an interaction between a bridge proton and the anhydride protons. While an NOE might exist, it's not the most distinct difference between the *endo* and *exo* forms.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This would be an interaction between the bridgehead methyls (~1.0 ppm) and the vinylic methyls (~1.7 ppm). The distance between them is fixed by the rigid frame and should be similar in both isomers.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This would be an interaction between the bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton. Again, this distance is not dependent on the *endo/exo* stereochemistry.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak unique to the major product connects the resonances described in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a \"dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene\" that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The resulting anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride. Due to its C₂ᵥ symmetry, the two vinyl protons are chemically and magnetically equivalent. They appear as a single peak. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is appropriate for vinyl protons next to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   Also due to symmetry, there are only two types of carbon atoms: the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and the two equivalent vinyl carbons (C=C). The peak at ~165 ppm is characteristic for an anhydride carbonyl carbon, and the peak at ~137 ppm is characteristic for a double-bond carbon.\n        *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride** (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   Let's determine its molecular formula to verify the product's formula later. The cyclopentadiene ring has 5 carbons. Four are substituted with methyl groups (C₁-C₄) and C₅ has two hydrogens. There are no other hydrogens on the ring itself. The four methyl groups contribute 4 x 3 = 12 hydrogens. Total hydrogens = 2 (at C₅) + 12 (from methyls) = 14. The formula is **C₉H₁₄**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   The product has a molecular formula of C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's check: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the information given.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes typically form two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the **endo rule**, the *endo* adduct is usually the major product because its transition state is stabilized by secondary orbital overlap. The *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Major Product (Endo Adduct):**\n    *   The product is a tricyclic compound with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   The diene is symmetric (it has a C₂ symmetry axis passing through C₅ and the midpoint of the C₂=C₃ bond). The dienophile is also symmetric. Therefore, the product will have a plane of symmetry (Cs symmetry).\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes pairs of protons and methyl groups chemically equivalent. Let's identify the proton signals we expect in the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls:** The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C₁ and C₄ of the original diene) are equivalent. They are attached to saturated quaternary carbons and should appear as a **6H singlet** at a high field (e.g., ~1.0 ppm).\n        *   **Vinyl Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the double bond (C₂ and C₃ of the original diene) are equivalent. They should appear as a **6H singlet** at a lower field than the other methyls (e.g., ~1.7 ppm).\n        *   **Bridge Protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ bridge (C₅ of the original diene) are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They should appear as a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift is sensitive to the endo/exo geometry.\n        *   **Fused Methine Protons:** The two protons from the maleic anhydride moiety are equivalent. They are alpha to carbonyl groups and should be significantly deshielded, appearing as a **2H singlet** at a low field (e.g., ~3.5 ppm).\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Cross-Peak:**\n    *   The question states that a specific NOESY cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two nuclei are close in space (typically < 5 Å). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Let's compare the spatial arrangement in the two isomers:\n        *   **Endo Isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the diene, on the same side (*syn*) as the C₅H₂ bridge. The two methine protons from the anhydride part (let's call them H_fused) are on the *exo* face of the newly formed ring, pointing \"upwards\". The vinyl methyl groups are also on the \"top\" of the molecule. Therefore, the **H_fused protons are close to the vinyl methyl groups**.\n        *   **Exo Isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C₅H₂ bridge. This means the H_fused protons are now on the *endo* face, pointing \"downwards\". The vinyl methyl groups are still on top. Therefore, the **H_fused protons are far from the vinyl methyl groups**.\n\n    *   This analysis reveals that a NOE between the **vinyl methyl groups** and the **H_fused protons** will be a unique feature of the major (*endo*) product.\n\n5.  **Match Analysis with a Multiple-Choice Option:**\n    *   We need to find the option that describes a cross-peak between the vinyl methyls and the H_fused protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignment in step 3:\n        *   Vinyl methyls = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n        *   H_fused protons = 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   Let's examine the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls). This NOE would likely be present in both isomers, as the distance between these groups is fixed by the carbon skeleton.\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The \"1H doublet\" is inconsistent with the expected symmetry of the product.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. The \"1H doublet\" is inconsistent with the expected symmetry.\n        *   D) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.** This perfectly matches our prediction for the vinyl methyl protons and the H_fused protons, which show a unique spatial proximity in the major (endo) product.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the resonance of the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) and the resonance of the fused methine protons (~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **The Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n        *   ¹H NMR of the anhydride: a single peak at 7 ppm.\n        *   ¹³C NMR of the anhydride: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride.\n        *   Let's check if the NMR data for maleic anhydride matches the description. Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry.\n            *   **¹H NMR:** The two vinylic protons are chemically equivalent. They would show up as a single peak. Protons on a double bond next to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups are expected to be significantly downfield, so a shift of 7 ppm is very reasonable.\n            *   **¹³C NMR:** There are two types of carbons: the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and the two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C). This would result in two peaks. Carbonyl carbons typically resonate around 160-180 ppm (165 ppm fits). Alkene carbons resonate around 100-150 ppm (137 ppm fits).\n        *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃)**.\n\n    *   **The Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The C5 carbon is a CH₂ group.\n        *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition**, a [4+2] reaction between a diene and a dienophile.\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). The molecular formula provided for the products matches the expected sum.\n    *   The reaction yields a major and a minor product. In Diels-Alder reactions, this typically corresponds to the formation of **endo** and **exo** diastereomers. The major product is usually the kinetically favored *endo* adduct, while the minor product is the thermodynamically favored *exo* adduct.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Products**\n    *   The reaction between a cyclic diene (cyclopentadiene derivative) and a dienophile produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton.\n    *   In our case, the product is **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2=C3 bond, the C5-C6 bond, and passes through the C7 atom.\n    *   **Protons in the product:**\n        *   Two bridgehead methyl groups (at C1 and C4). They are equivalent by symmetry. This gives a **6H singlet**.\n        *   Two vinylic methyl groups (at C2 and C3). They are also equivalent by symmetry. This gives a **6H singlet**.\n        *   Two protons on the anhydride part (at C5 and C6). They are equivalent by symmetry and not coupled to any other protons. This gives a **2H singlet**.\n        *   Two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the C=C double bond, one is *anti*). They are geminally coupled to each other, so they will appear as a pair of doublets (an AB system or, if the coupling constant is small compared to the chemical shift difference, an AX system). The problem refers to one of them as a **1H doublet**.\n\n4.  **Assign the NMR Signals**\n    *   We need to assign the given chemical shifts to the proton signals we've identified.\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Protons on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups are downfield. This signal corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring (H5 and H6).\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Vinylic methyl groups (protons on a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond) typically resonate around 1.6-2.5 ppm. This signal corresponds to the methyl groups at C2 and C3.\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Methyl groups on a saturated, tertiary carbon (like a bridgehead) resonate further upfield, typically 0.8-1.5 ppm. This signal corresponds to the methyl groups at C1 and C4.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This corresponds to one of the C7 bridge protons.\n\n5.  **Interpret the NOESY Data**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that is unique to the major (endo) isomer.\n    *   **Endo vs. Exo Stereochemistry:**\n        *   In the **endo** adduct (the major product), the anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the C=C double bond of the bicyclic system due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions during the transition state. This places the anhydride protons (H5, H6) close to the vinylic substituents (the methyl groups at C2, C3).\n        *   In the **exo** adduct (the minor product), the anhydride ring is oriented away from the C=C double bond. The anhydride protons (H5, H6) are far from the vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion from NOESY:** The NOESY cross-peak that is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product must be between the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl groups**.\n\n6.  **Match the Finding to the Options**\n    *   We identified the key NOE as being between:\n        *   The anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   The vinylic methyl protons: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This corresponds directly to option D.\n\n    *   Let's review the other options to confirm:\n        *   A) 6H singlet (~1 ppm) and 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm): Bridgehead methyls and a C7 proton. This proximity might exist in both isomers.\n        *   B) 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm) and 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm): A C7 proton and the anhydride protons. This proximity is expected in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) product.\n        *   C) 6H singlet (~1 ppm) and 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm): Bridgehead methyls and vinylic methyls. The distance is fixed by the rigid bicyclic frame and would be the same in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the only option that describes a NOESY cross-peak characteristic of the major (endo) adduct is the one connecting the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   The first reactant is a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene, which upon dehydration forms an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is given:\n        *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. The value of 7 ppm is in the aromatic/alkene region. A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene region) and 165 ppm (carbonyl region). Two peaks imply there are only two types of carbon atoms in the molecule.\n    *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. Maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid) is a cis-dicarboxylic acid. Its dehydration product, maleic anhydride, has a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. This gives one ¹H signal and two ¹³C signals, consistent with the provided data.\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is the diene for the Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition** between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n\n2.  **Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclic diene and a dienophile can produce two diastereomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   According to the Alder endo rule, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product and is typically the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically more stable product and is typically the **minor product**.\n    *   The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed. We can confidently assign the major product as the *endo* isomer and the minor product as the *exo* isomer.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products:**\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of the resulting bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n        *   The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The diene system involves carbons C1, C2, C3, and C4. The reaction happens between C1 and C4 of the diene and the two carbons of the maleic anhydride double bond.\n        *   In the product, the original C1 and C4 of the diene become the bridgehead carbons, each bearing a methyl group (**bridgehead methyls**).\n        *   The original C2 and C3 of the diene form the new double bond in the bicyclic system, each bearing a methyl group (**vinyl methyls**).\n        *   The original C5 of the diene (a CH2 group) becomes the one-carbon bridge (the **methylene bridge**, C7). This bridge has two diastereotopic protons: **H_syn** (pointing towards the double bond) and **H_anti** (pointing away).\n        *   The carbons from the maleic anhydride form the two-carbon bridge, which includes the anhydride functionality. The two protons on this bridge (**H_b**) are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry in the molecule.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Spatial Relationships (NOE):**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). We need to find an NOE interaction that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride part of the molecule is tucked \"under\" the main six-membered ring, on the same side as the methylene (C7) bridge.\n        *   This geometry places the anhydride protons (**H_b**) very close to the **H_syn** proton on the methylene bridge. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between H_b and H_syn.\n        *   The H_b protons are far from the H_anti proton.\n        *   The bridgehead methyl groups point generally \"up and away\" from the center of the bicyclic cage, making them distant from the endo H_b protons.\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride part is oriented \"up\", away from the methylene bridge.\n        *   This geometry places the anhydride protons (**H_b**) far from the **H_syn** proton. The NOE cross-peak between H_b and H_syn will be absent or very weak.\n        *   The H_b protons are now close to the H_anti proton.\n        *   The H_b protons are also now on the same side as the bridgehead methyl groups, so an NOE may be observed between them.\n\n5.  **Identify the Differentiating Cross-Peak and Match with Options:**\n    *   The NOE interaction that is strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent/weak in the minor (*exo*) product is the one between the anhydride protons (**H_b**) and the **H_syn** proton of the methylene bridge.\n    *   Now, let's assign the NMR signals given in the options to these protons:\n        *   **H_b**: These two equivalent protons are on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. They will be deshielded. The `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` is the correct assignment for H_b.\n        *   **H_syn / H_anti**: These are the two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic and couple to each other (geminal coupling), so they should appear as a pair of doublets. H_syn is shielded by the anisotropy of the nearby C=C bond, so it will appear at a higher field (lower ppm) than H_anti. The `1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm` is a reasonable assignment for one of these protons, most likely H_syn.\n        *   **Methyl groups**: There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the two bridgehead methyls and the two vinyl methyls. These will appear as two `6H singlets`, for example at `~1.0 ppm` and `~1.7 ppm`.\n    *   The diagnostic cross-peak for the major product is between **H_b** and **H_syn**.\n    *   This corresponds to an interaction between the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` and the `1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm`.\n    *   This matches the description in Option D.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: NOE between the two different methyl groups. This is not the primary peak that distinguishes endo from exo.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: NOE between a set of methyl groups and H_b. As argued above, this interaction is expected to be strong in the *minor (exo)* product (between H_b and bridgehead methyls), not the major (endo) product.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: NOE between a methyl group and a bridge proton. This is possible, but the NOE between H_b and H_syn is the classic and most conclusive evidence for the endo geometry.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak present in the major product and absent in the minor product connects the resonances of H_b and H_syn.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n    *   The dienophile is formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. This describes the conversion of maleic acid to maleic anhydride. The NMR data provided for the anhydride (¹H: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are consistent with the symmetric structure of maleic anhydride.\n    *   The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄. The structure consists of a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds (a cyclopentadiene system) and four methyl groups attached to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. The carbon at position 5 is a CH₂ group.\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, matches the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄).\n\n2.  **Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes typically produce two diastereomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n    *   According to the Alder rule, the *endo* product is usually the kinetically favored product (the major product under standard conditions) due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   However, significant steric hindrance can override this electronic preference. In the diene, there are methyl groups at the bridgehead-forming carbons (C1 and C4). For the *endo* transition state, the anhydride moiety of the dienophile must approach from underneath the diene ring, leading to a severe steric clash with these bridgehead methyl groups.\n    *   In the *exo* transition state, the anhydride moiety points away from the bridgehead methyls, though it gets closer to the vinyl methyl groups (on C2 and C3). This steric interaction is generally considered less severe than the clash with the bridgehead methyls in the *endo* approach.\n    *   Therefore, due to steric hindrance, the **exo adduct is the major product**, and the *endo* adduct is the minor product.\n\n3.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n    *   The problem provides four distinct NMR signals and their integrals. Let's assign them to the protons in the product structure (a tetramethyl-substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride). The product has a plane of symmetry, simplifying the spectrum.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinyl methyls) typically resonate around 1.6-1.8 ppm. There are two such equivalent methyl groups (on C2 and C3 of the original diene). This signal corresponds to the **vinyl methyls**.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** Methyl groups on a saturated carbon atom typically resonate around 0.9-1.2 ppm. There are two such equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). This signal corresponds to the **bridgehead methyls**.\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two protons originating from the maleic anhydride. They are now on a saturated carbon framework and are alpha to carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Their equivalence due to symmetry leads to a singlet. This signal corresponds to the **anhydride-derived protons (H_alkane)**.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal represents one of the two diastereotopic protons of the methylene bridge (C7). The other proton would be a separate signal. This corresponds to one of the **bridge protons (H_bridge)**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations between protons that are close in three-dimensional space (typically < 5 Å apart).\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that is unique to the major (*exo*) adduct.\n    *   Let's visualize the structures:\n        *   **Exo Adduct (Major):** The anhydride part (and its protons, H_alkane) is on the same side of the molecule as the C2=C3 double bond. The H_alkane protons (~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the **vinyl methyls** (~1.7 ppm). They are far from the methylene bridge protons.\n        *   **Endo Adduct (Minor):** The anhydride part is tucked underneath, on the same side as the methylene bridge. The H_alkane protons (~3.5 ppm) are far from the vinyl methyls. However, they are close to the **bridge protons** (~1.5 ppm).\n    *   The NOE interaction that is characteristic of the **major (exo) adduct** is the one between the **H_alkane protons** and the **vinyl methyl protons**.\n    *   The NOE interaction that is characteristic of the **minor (endo) adduct** is the one between the **H_alkane protons** and the **bridge protons**.\n    *   Since the observed cross-peak is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product, it must be the correlation unique to the *exo* form.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the H_alkane protons with the vinyl methyl protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic acid:** The problem describes a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid that dehydrates to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   A single ¹H peak at 7 ppm suggests two equivalent vinylic (alkene) protons.\n        *   Two ¹³C peaks suggest a high degree of symmetry. The shifts at 137 ppm (alkene C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl C) are characteristic.\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**, which is formed from the dehydration of *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid).\n        *   Reactant 1 (after dehydration) is maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a cyclic diene (C₅H₂(CH₃)₄), with a molecular formula of C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the formula given in the problem.\n\n3.  **Determine the Products' Stereochemistry:**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes and dienophiles typically produce two stereoisomers: the ***endo*** adduct and the ***exo*** adduct.\n    *   According to the **Alder endo rule**, the *endo* product is kinetically favored and is usually the **major product**. The *exo* product is thermodynamically more stable but forms slower, making it the **minor product**.\n    *   **Endo adduct (Major):** The substituents on the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are oriented on the same side as the bridge formed from the diene (the C7 methylene bridge) and are \"tucked under\" the newly formed six-membered ring.\n    *   **Exo adduct (Minor):** The anhydride ring points away from the C7 bridge.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NMR Data and Structures:**\n    *   The key to solving the problem is the **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** data. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close to each other in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product (*endo*)** but **absent in the minor product (*exo*)**. We need to find the pair of protons that fits this description.\n    *   Let's visualize the *endo* and *exo* structures and identify the key protons and their spatial relationships.\n        *   **Anhydride Protons:** There are two protons on the portion of the molecule that came from maleic anhydride. Due to a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule, these two protons are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a **2H singlet**. Based on the options, this signal is at **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Methyl Protons:** There are four methyl groups attached to the double bond. The same plane of symmetry makes them equivalent in two pairs.\n            *   One pair of methyl groups is on the \"endo\" face, closer to the anhydride ring.\n            *   The other pair is on the \"exo\" face, further from the anhydride ring.\n            *   This results in two distinct **6H singlets**. Based on the options, their shifts are **~1.0 ppm** and **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridge Protons:** The C7 methylene bridge has two protons that are not equivalent (diastereotopic). They will likely appear as two separate signals, each coupling with the other (e.g., two doublets). One of these is given as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Identify the Distinguishing NOE Interaction:**\n    *   We need an interaction that exists *only* in the major (*endo*) product.\n    *   **In the *endo* isomer:** The anhydride ring is tucked under the main ring system. This brings the **anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm)** very close to the pair of **methyl groups on the \"endo\" face**. This close proximity will result in a strong NOE cross-peak.\n    *   **In the *exo* isomer:** The anhydride ring points away from the main ring system. The anhydride protons are now very far from all four methyl groups. Therefore, the NOE between the anhydride protons and the methyl groups will be absent or extremely weak.\n    *   This interaction perfectly fits the description. The cross-peak is between the anhydride protons and one of the methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   The interaction is between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (anhydride protons) and one of the **6H singlets** (methyl protons).\n    *   Let's analyze the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Methyl <=> Bridge Proton): This interaction is likely present in both isomers to some extent.\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Bridge Proton <=> Anhydride Proton): This NOE would be stronger in the *endo* isomer, but the interaction between the anhydride and methyl groups is geometrically more direct and a more classic diagnostic tool for this stereochemistry.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Methyl <=> Methyl): These groups are on opposite sides of a double bond and far apart. No NOE is expected.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Methyl <=> Anhydride Proton): This matches our analysis perfectly. The methyl groups closer to the electron-withdrawing anhydride group are expected to be deshielded (have a higher ppm value), so assigning them the ~1.7 ppm shift is reasonable. This NOE is characteristic of the *endo* adduct.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the resonances of the anhydride protons and the nearby methyl groups.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which upon dehydration forms an anhydride. The spectral data for this anhydride are a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   Let's analyze maleic anhydride, which is formed from *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid).\n        *   **Structure:** Maleic anhydride is a planar, five-membered ring with a C=C double bond and C₂ᵥ symmetry.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** Due to symmetry, the two protons on the double bond are chemically equivalent. They are vinyl protons adjacent to carbonyl groups, so their chemical shift is expected to be significantly downfield. A single peak at ~7 ppm is a perfect match.\n        *   **¹³C NMR:** There are two sets of equivalent carbons: the two vinyl carbons (C=C) and the two carbonyl carbons (C=O). This would give two signals. Carbonyl carbons typically resonate at 160-180 ppm (matching 165 ppm), and alkene carbons at 100-150 ppm (matching 137 ppm).\n    *   Conclusion: The anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction and products.**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The specific skeleton formed from a cyclopentadiene derivative is a **bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene** system.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is given as C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify this.\n        *   Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄) → C₁₃H₁₆O₃. The formula is correct.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two main stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. According to the \"endo rule,\" the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product, while the *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically favored product.\n    *   **Major product = Endo adduct.**\n    *   **Minor product = Exo adduct.**\n    *   Let's visualize the structures. The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene skeleton.\n        *   The anhydride ring is fused at positions C2 and C3.\n        *   Methyl groups are at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and on the double bond (C5, C6).\n        *   A CH₂ group forms the C7 bridge.\n    *   In the **endo adduct (major)**, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side as) the C7 bridge. The two protons on the anhydride part (at C2 and C3) are therefore on the *exo* face.\n    *   In the **exo adduct (minor)**, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side of) the C7 bridge. The two protons at C2 and C3 are on the *endo* face.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the NOESY spectrum.**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially proximate protons.\n    *   We are looking for a cross-peak present in the major product (endo) but absent in the minor product (exo). This requires finding a pair of protons that are close in the endo isomer but far apart in the exo isomer.\n    *   Let's consider the key protons:\n        *   **H(anhydride):** The two equivalent protons at C2 and C3.\n        *   **H(bridge):** The two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge, H-syn (pointing towards the C5=C6 double bond) and H-anti (pointing away from it).\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        *   **In the endo (major) product:** The H(anhydride) protons are on the *exo* face. They are spatially close to the **H-syn** proton on the C7 bridge. They are far from the H-anti proton.\n        *   **In the exo (minor) product:** The H(anhydride) protons are on the *endo* face. They are spatially close to the **H-anti** proton on the C7 bridge. They are far from the H-syn proton.\n    *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak between **H(anhydride) and H-syn** will be present (strong) in the major product and absent (or very weak) in the minor product. This is the distinguishing feature.\n\n*   **Step 4: Assign the NMR signals from the options.**\n    *   The options provide the following signals:\n        *   A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm\n        *   A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n        *   A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n        *   A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n    *   Let's assign these based on typical chemical shifts and the molecular structure:\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are protons on sp³ carbons (C2, C3) adjacent to two carbonyl groups in a strained ring system. This chemical shift is highly characteristic of the **H(anhydride)** protons.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Methyl groups on a double bond (vinylic methyls) typically resonate around 1.6-2.0 ppm. This is likely the two equivalent methyl groups on C5 and C6.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** Methyl groups on a saturated, sp³ bridgehead carbon typically resonate further upfield. This is likely the two equivalent methyl groups on C1 and C4.\n        *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This must correspond to one of the C7 bridge protons (**H-syn** or H-anti). Given that we are looking for its interaction with H(anhydride) in the major product, this signal must be for **H-syn**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Identify the correct option.**\n    *   We have established that the unique cross-peak in the major product is between H(anhydride) and H-syn.\n    *   Based on our signal assignment, this corresponds to a cross-peak between:\n        *   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H(anhydride))\n        *   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (H-syn)\n    *   This matches option B.\n\n    Let's re-check the other options:\n    *   A) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H-syn): An NOE might exist with H-anti, not H-syn. Not the distinguishing feature.\n    *   C) 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl Me) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H(anhydride)): These protons are far apart in both isomers.\n    *   D) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl Me): These are on adjacent carbons, so an NOE is expected in both isomers. Not a distinguishing feature.\n\nThe only option describing an interaction unique to the major (endo) product is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is given:\n    *   `1H NMR`: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two equivalent protons in the same chemical environment, likely vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond) that are deshielded.\n    *   `13C NMR`: Two peaks at 137 ppm (characteristic of C=C carbons) and 165 ppm (characteristic of carbonyl C=O carbons).\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Its dehydration product is **maleic anhydride**. Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinylic protons and a plane of symmetry, matching the `1H` NMR data. It also has two equivalent vinylic carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, matching the `13C` NMR data. Therefore, the anhydride reactant is maleic anhydride.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The second reactant is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene suitable for a Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the reaction and the products.**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The general structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system fused with the anhydride ring.\n*   The reaction produces two stereoisomers: the **endo** and **exo** products. Typically in Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is kinetically favored and thus the **major product**, while the *exo* product is the **minor product**.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3. Let's verify:\n    *   Diene (C9H14): 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    *   Dienophile (C4H2O3): Maleic anhydride.\n    *   Product (C9H14 + C4H2O3 - H2O?) No, it's an addition reaction. Formula of diene is C5H2(CH3)4 = C9H14. Formula of dienophile is C4H2O3. Total: C(9+4)H(14+2)O3 = C13H16O3. The formula given in the question is correct.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of the products and predict their NMR signals.**\n\n*   The product molecule (both endo and exo isomers) has a plane of symmetry.\n*   Let's identify the different types of protons and their expected signals in the `1H NMR` spectrum:\n    1.  **Bridgehead Methyls (`Me_bridgehead`)**: Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Expected chemical shift: ~1.0-1.3 ppm (shielded, attached to sp3 C).\n    2.  **Vinylic Methyls (`Me_vinyl`)**: Two methyl groups on the double bond carbons (C5 and C6). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Expected chemical shift: ~1.7-2.0 ppm (deshielded, attached to sp2 C).\n    3.  **Anhydride Protons (`H_anhydride`)**: Two protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (C2 and C3). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **2H singlet**. Expected chemical shift: ~3.0-4.0 ppm (deshielded by adjacent C=O).\n    4.  **Bridge Protons (`H_bridge`)**: Two protons of the CH2 group at the C7 bridge. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **2H singlet** or an AB quartet. Expected chemical shift: ~1.5-2.5 ppm.\n\n**Step 4: Use the NOESY data to distinguish between the major and minor products.**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The question states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we need to find a pair of proton groups that are close in the major (*endo*) isomer but far apart in the minor (*exo*) isomer.\n*   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 bridge. This geometry places the `H_anhydride` protons (which point away from the bridge) close to the `Me_vinyl` groups on the C5=C6 double bond. **A strong NOE cross-peak between `H_anhydride` and `Me_vinyl` is expected.**\n*   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. This geometry places the `H_anhydride` protons far away from the `Me_vinyl` groups. **The NOE cross-peak between `H_anhydride` and `Me_vinyl` would be absent or very weak.**\n*   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak connects the `H_anhydride` protons and the `Me_vinyl` protons.\n\n**Step 5: Match the proton groups to the signals described in the options.**\n\n*   Based on our chemical shift predictions:\n    *   `H_anhydride` ≈ 3.5 ppm (a 2H singlet)\n    *   `Me_vinyl` ≈ 1.7 ppm (a 6H singlet)\n*   The distinguishing cross-peak in the major product connects the resonance at ~1.7 ppm (6H) and the resonance at ~3.5 ppm (2H).\n*   Let's check the options:\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (problematic signal description).\n    *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (problematic) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`).\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`). The distance between these groups is similar in both isomers, so an NOE would be present in both, not just the major one.\n    *   D) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`)**. This matches our analysis perfectly. The NOE between these two groups is strong in the major (endo) product and weak/absent in the minor (exo) product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic acid and anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride is characterized by:\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak indicates that all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift (7 ppm) is in the vinylic (alkene) region.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. A value around 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride, while a value around 137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon (C=C).\n    *   The high symmetry (one ¹H peak, two ¹³C peaks) and the cis-alkene origin strongly point to **maleic anhydride**. Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry, making its two alkene protons equivalent and its two carbonyl carbons equivalent. The two alkene carbons are also equivalent. This perfectly matches the NMR data.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated system (C1, C2, C3, C4).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and its products.**\n\n*   **Reaction type:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This reaction forms a six-membered ring, resulting in a bicyclic adduct.\n*   **Stoichiometry:** The molecular formula of the diene is C₉H₁₄, and the dienophile is C₄H₂O₃. The product's molecular formula would be C₉₊₄H₁₄₊₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Endo vs. Exo):** Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes typically produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The **Alder Endo Rule** states that the kinetically favored product is the *endo* isomer. This is usually the **major product**.\n    *   The *exo* isomer is thermodynamically more stable but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n    *   The key structural difference between the *endo* and *exo* adducts of cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride lies in the relative orientation of the anhydride ring with respect to the newly formed bicyclic system.\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) the alkene bridge (`-C(Me)=C(Me)-`). This places the protons on the anhydride part (let's call them Hα) in close spatial proximity to the methyl groups on the double bond.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side of) the alkene bridge. This places the Hα protons far away from the methyl groups on the double bond.\n\nLet's visualize the major (*endo*) product:\n```\n         // Endo Isomer (Major Product) //\n\n               CH2 (C7 bridge)\n              /   \\\n      (Me)C1-------C4(Me) (bridgehead)\n         |         |\n      (Me)C5=======C6(Me)  <-- Alkene Methyls are close to...\n           \\       /\n            \\     /\n           Hα-C-----C-Hα    <-- Anhydride Protons\n             |       |\n           O=C-------C=O\n               \\   /\n                 O\n```\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the NOESY NMR data.**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect SpectroscopY)** shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds.\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This cross-peak must correspond to a spatial proximity that exists only in the *endo* isomer.\n*   Based on our structural analysis, the unique proximity in the *endo* (major) product is between the **anhydride protons (Hα)** and the **alkene methyl protons**.\n*   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak connects the signals for these two sets of protons.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the ¹H NMR signals and match with the options.**\n\nNow we need to predict the chemical shifts and multiplicities for the relevant protons in the product.\n\n1.  **Anhydride Protons (Hα):**\n    *   These are two equivalent protons on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups.\n    *   They are equivalent by symmetry, so they should appear as a **singlet**.\n    *   Their integral will be **2H**.\n    *   Their chemical shift will be downfield due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the anhydride. A typical range is **~3.5-4.0 ppm**.\n    *   So, we look for a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n\n2.  **Alkene Methyl Protons:**\n    *   These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to a double bond.\n    *   They are equivalent by symmetry, so they should appear as a **singlet**.\n    *   Their integral will be **6H**.\n    *   The typical chemical shift for vinylic methyl groups is **~1.6-2.0 ppm**.\n    *   So, we look for a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\n3.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:**\n    *   These are two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. They will also be a **6H singlet** but at a higher field (more shielded), typically **~1.0-1.3 ppm**.\n\n4.  **Methylene Bridge Protons (C7-H):**\n    *   These two protons are non-equivalent and would likely form a complex multiplet or an AB quartet.\n\nThe cross-peak in the major product connects the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons. We are looking for the option that describes these two signals.\n\n*   **Signal 1:** 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Anhydride protons)\n*   **Signal 2:** 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Alkene methyls)\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\nOption B perfectly matches our prediction for the two interacting groups of protons. The `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm` corresponds to the alkene methyls, and the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` corresponds to the anhydride protons (Hα). This interaction is unique to the major *endo* isomer, as required by the problem description.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of this anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two equivalent vinylic protons.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This also points to a symmetrical molecule.\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is *cis*-butenedioic acid, also known as maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) perfectly matches the NMR data. The two vinylic protons are equivalent, giving a singlet around 7 ppm. The two vinylic carbons are equivalent (around 137 ppm), and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent (around 165 ppm).\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene** (C₉H₁₄).\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction and its products.**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene) and maleic anhydride (the dienophile).\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is given as C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify this: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. The formula is correct.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n    *   The *Alder endo rule* predicts that the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product, due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene and the dienophile's electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. In our diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, there are methyl groups at carbons C1 and C4, the positions that form the new sigma bonds.\n    *   In the *endo* transition state, the maleic anhydride ring approaches from under the diene ring, causing a significant steric clash between the anhydride and the methyl groups at C1 and C4.\n    *   In the *exo* transition state, the maleic anhydride ring approaches from above, pointing away from the methyl groups at C1 and C4, minimizing steric hindrance.\n    *   Due to this severe steric clash, the **exo adduct is the major product**, and the *endo* adduct is the minor product. This is a classic exception to the endo rule.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry and proton proximities of the products.**\n    *   We use 2D NOESY NMR to determine which protons are close in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of protons that are spatially close. We are looking for a cross-peak present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product.\n    *   **Major Product (Exo Isomer):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the bicyclic system from the C7-methylene bridge. In this geometry, the two protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) are close to the two vinyl methyl groups (at C2 and C3 of the original diene).\n    *   **Minor Product (Endo Isomer):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. In this geometry, the H_anhydride protons are far from the vinyl methyl groups. They are instead close to the protons of the C7 bridge and the bridgehead methyl groups (at C1 and C4).\n    *   Therefore, the NOE interaction (cross-peak) between the **H_anhydride protons** and the **vinyl methyl protons** will be present and strong in the major (exo) product and absent or very weak in the minor (endo) product.\n\n*   **Step 4: Assign the ¹H NMR signals.**\n    *   The product molecule has a plane of symmetry, simplifying the NMR spectrum.\n    *   **H_anhydride protons:** Two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are on sp³ carbons alpha to a carbonyl group in a strained ring system. A typical chemical shift for such protons is around **~3.5 ppm**. They are chemically equivalent and do not have adjacent protons to couple with, so they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **Vinyl methyl groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond. A typical chemical shift for vinyl methyls is **~1.7 ppm**. They are equivalent, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the sp³ bridgehead carbons. These are further from electronegative groups and double bonds. A typical chemical shift is **~1.0 ppm**. They are equivalent, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   The options with \"1H doublet\" (B and C) are inconsistent with the symmetrical structure of the product.\n\n*   **Step 5: Identify the cross-peak.**\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak in the major (exo) product's NOESY spectrum is between the H_anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons.\n    *   Based on our assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option A.\n\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride).** This is the correct pair of resonances, as they are close in space only in the major (exo) product.\n    *   B) Inconsistent integral and splitting pattern.\n    *   C) Inconsistent integral and splitting pattern.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls). These groups are relatively far apart in both isomers, so a strong, distinguishing NOE is not expected.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene dehydrated to an anhydride:** The NMR data for this anhydride (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: 137, 165 ppm) points to maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinyl protons (~7.0 ppm), two equivalent alkene carbons (~135 ppm), and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm), matching the data perfectly.\n    *   **Diene:** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This molecule has a C₅ ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 and 3. There are methyl groups on carbons C1, C2, C3, and C4, and a CH₂ group at C5. The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n\n2.  **Determine the Products:**\n    *   A Diels-Alder reaction creates a new six-membered ring. In this case, it forms a bicyclic adduct with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework.\n    *   The reaction yields two products, a major and a minor one. These correspond to the two possible stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   According to the Alder endo rule, the *endo* adduct is kinetically favored and is therefore the major product. The *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula of the adduct: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given in the question.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products and Predict ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product has a plane of symmetry that bisects the anhydride ring, the newly formed C=C bond, and the C7-methylene bridge.\n    *   This symmetry results in four main sets of proton signals:\n        1.  **Vinylic methyl protons (Me_vinyl):** The two methyl groups on the C=C bond (at C2 and C3 of the bicyclic system) are equivalent. This gives a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically around 1.5-2.0 ppm.\n        2.  **Bridgehead methyl protons (Me_bridgehead):** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (at C1 and C4) are equivalent. This gives a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically lower, around 1.0-1.3 ppm.\n        3.  **Anhydride protons (H_anhydride):** The two protons on the carbons fused to the anhydride ring (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This gives a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift is expected to be higher, around 3.0-4.0 ppm, due to being adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring.\n        4.  **Methylene bridge protons (H_bridge):** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the C=C bond, the other is *anti*). They are not equivalent and would appear as two separate signals, each with an integral of 1H, likely coupled to each other (geminal coupling), appearing as doublets or part of a more complex multiplet. Their chemical shifts are typically in the 1.0-2.0 ppm range.\n\n4.  **Use the NOESY Data to Distinguish Between Endo (Major) and Exo (Minor) Products:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists only in the *endo* isomer.\n    *   **In the endo isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the C2=C3 double bond, on the same side as the C7-methylene bridge. This geometry brings the anhydride protons (H_anhydride) very close to:\n        *   The vinylic methyl groups (Me_vinyl).\n        *   The *syn*-proton of the C7-methylene bridge (H_bridge_syn).\n    *   **In the exo isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring points away from the C=C bond and the C7-bridge. The distances between H_anhydride and both Me_vinyl and H_bridge are much larger.\n    *   Therefore, an NOE cross-peak between H_anhydride and either Me_vinyl or H_bridge_syn will be strong in the major (endo) product and absent/weak in the minor (exo) product.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   Let's assign the signals from the options to the protons we identified:\n        *   A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm -> **Me_vinyl**\n        *   A 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm -> **Me_bridgehead**\n        *   A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> **H_anhydride**\n        *   A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm -> **H_bridge** (likely the *syn* proton)\n    *   Now let's check which option describes an interaction specific to the endo isomer:\n        *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride).** This corresponds to the spatial proximity between the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons. This NOE is strong in the endo isomer and absent in the exo isomer. This is a very strong candidate.\n        *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge).** This interaction is present in both isomers. It is not a differentiating peak.\n        *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl).** The distance between these two sets of methyl groups is determined by the rigid bicyclic framework and would be similar in both isomers.\n        *   **D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride).** This corresponds to the proximity between a bridge proton and the anhydride protons. This NOE is also strong in the endo isomer and absent in the exo.\n\n6.  **Choose the Best Answer:**\n    *   Both options A and D describe valid NOE correlations that are unique to the major (endo) product.\n    *   However, the interaction in option A is between a group of 6 protons (Me_vinyl) and a group of 2 protons (H_anhydride). The interaction in option D is between 1 proton (H_bridge) and 2 protons (H_anhydride).\n    *   The intensity of an NOE cross-peak is proportional to the number of interacting protons. The interaction described in A (involving 6 protons and 2 protons) will give rise to a significantly more intense cross-peak than the one in D (involving 1 proton and 2 protons), assuming similar distances.\n    *   The question refers to \"*a* cross-peak\" that differentiates the isomers, suggesting the most prominent and characteristic one. The NOE between the anhydride protons and the protons on the vinylic system (in this case, the methyl groups) is the classic textbook example used to identify the endo adduct in these reactions.\n\nTherefore, the most likely and prominent differentiating cross-peak connects the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Identify the Molecules:**\n    *   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a ¹H NMR with a single peak at 7 ppm (implying all protons are equivalent, located on a double bond) and a ¹³C NMR with two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This high degree of symmetry and the spectral data point unequivocally to **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The problem explicitly states this is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene locked in the *s-cis* conformation required for a Diels-Alder reaction. It has a five-membered ring containing a C₁=C₂-C₃=C₄ diene system, with methyl groups on each of these four carbons, and a -CH₂- group at C₅.\n    *   **The Reaction:** A Diels-Alder reaction between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n2.  **Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction creates a bicyclic adduct. Because the diene is cyclic, two stereoisomers are possible: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** The *endo* rule states that for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the adduct where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the carbonyls of the anhydride) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed ring is the major product. In this case, it means the anhydride ring will be tucked \"under\" the diene, on the same side as the C₅-methylene bridge (which becomes the C₇ bridge of the product).\n    *   Therefore, the **major product** is the ***endo* adduct** and the **minor product** is the ***exo* adduct**.\n\n3.  **Account for the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Maleic Anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) + Tetramethylcyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₂) → Diels-Alder Adduct (C₁₃H₁₄O₃).\n    *   The problem states the final products have a formula of **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This means two hydrogen atoms have been added to the initial adduct (C₁₃H₁₄O₃ + H₂ → C₁₃H₁₆O₃).\n    *   This implies a **reduction** reaction occurred after the Diels-Alder reaction. The only reducible group is the C=C double bond in the newly formed six-membered ring (the original C₂=C₃ bond of the diene).\n    *   So, the overall process is a Diels-Alder reaction followed by the catalytic hydrogenation of the product's double bond.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 3D Structure and NOESY Predictions for the Major Product:**\n    *   **Structure:** We start with the *endo* adduct. Let's orient it with the C₇ methylene bridge pointing \"up\". In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is also pointing \"down\", *syn* to the C₇ bridge. This means the two protons on the anhydride fusion point (let's call them H_anhydride) are in an *exo* orientation, pointing \"up and away\".\n    *   **Reduction Step:** The C=C double bond is hydrogenated. The hydrogen atoms (H₂) will add from the sterically least hindered face. The *endo* face (bottom) is very crowded by the anhydride ring. Therefore, the H₂ adds from the *exo* face (top). This places the two new protons (let's call them H_internal) in *exo* positions, and pushes the two methyl groups that were on the double bond (Me_internal) into the *endo* positions.\n    *   **Final Major Product Structure Summary:**\n        *   `H_anhydride` (protons at C₅,C₆): *exo*-oriented.\n        *   `Me_internal` (methyls at C₂,C₃): *endo*-oriented.\n        *   `Me_bridgehead` (methyls at C₁,C₄): Fixed at bridgehead positions.\n    *   **NOESY Proximity:** NOESY detects through-space proximity. Let's analyze key distances in the rigid bicyclic frame.\n        *   The *exo*-oriented `H_anhydride` protons are close to the bridgehead positions (C₁ and C₄). Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak is expected between `H_anhydride` and `Me_bridgehead`.\n        *   `H_anhydride` (exo) and `Me_internal` (endo) are on opposite faces of the molecule, so any NOE between them would be weak or absent.\n\n5.  **Analyze the 3D Structure and NOESY Predictions for the Minor Product:**\n    *   **Structure:** We start with the *exo* adduct. The C₇ bridge is \"up\", and the anhydride ring is also \"up\" (*anti* to the C₇ bridge). This puts the `H_anhydride` protons in an *endo* orientation, pointing \"down\".\n    *   **Reduction Step:** As before, H₂ adds from the less hindered face, pushing `Me_internal` into the *endo* position.\n    *   **Final Minor Product Structure Summary:**\n        *   `H_anhydride`: *endo*-oriented.\n        *   `Me_internal`: *endo*-oriented.\n        *   `Me_bridgehead`: Fixed at bridgehead positions.\n    *   **NOESY Proximity:**\n        *   Both `H_anhydride` and `Me_internal` are in the crowded *endo* region. They will be close in space, resulting in a strong NOE.\n        *   The *endo*-oriented `H_anhydride` protons are now far away from the `Me_bridgehead` methyls. No NOE is expected between them.\n\n6.  **Identify the Distinguishing Cross-Peak:**\n    *   **Major Product:** Has an NOE between `H_anhydride` and `Me_bridgehead`.\n    *   **Minor Product:** Does **not** have an NOE between `H_anhydride` and `Me_bridgehead`.\n    *   The question asks for the cross-peak **present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product**. This is clearly the cross-peak connecting `H_anhydride` and `Me_bridgehead`.\n\n7.  **Assign NMR Signals and Select the Correct Option:**\n    *   First, let's assign the signals described in the options to the proton groups we've identified.\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This is characteristic of protons on a carbon alpha to two carbonyl groups in a rigid system. This must be `H_anhydride`.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm & 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the two sets of methyl groups, `Me_bridgehead` and `Me_internal`. In the major product, the `Me_internal` groups are in the crowded *endo* position, which typically causes shielding (an upfield shift to lower ppm). The `Me_bridgehead` groups are in a more open environment. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign:\n            *   `Me_internal` = 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm\n            *   `Me_bridgehead` = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak connects `H_anhydride` (~3.5 ppm) and `Me_bridgehead` (~1.7 ppm).\n    *   Now, let's check the given options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_internal <=> Me_bridgehead)\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n        *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   D) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (`Me_bridgehead` <=> `H_anhydride`)\n    *   Option D perfectly matches our conclusion. The cross-peak connects the resonance for the bridgehead methyls (~1.7 ppm) and the resonance for the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid that forms an anhydride upon dehydration. This anhydride has specific NMR characteristics:\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift (7 ppm) is in the vinylic or aromatic region.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).\n    *   This description perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. Maleic acid is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Upon dehydration, it forms a cyclic anhydride. Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making its two vinylic protons equivalent (hence one ¹H NMR peak) and its two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons equivalent (hence two ¹³C NMR peaks). The chemical shifts provided are also characteristic of maleic anhydride. So, the dienophile is maleic anhydride.\n    *   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (C1=C2-C3=C4) and methyl groups attached to all four of these carbons. The fifth carbon (C5) is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n\n*   **Step 2: The Diels-Alder Reaction.**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a [4+2] cycloaddition, also known as a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The stereochemistry of the reaction is important. Two main products can be formed: the *endo* and the *exo* isomer.\n    *   The **Endo Rule** for Diels-Alder reactions states that the kinetic product (the one formed faster, usually the major product under non-reversible conditions) is the *endo* isomer. In the *endo* isomer, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are tucked underneath the newly formed cyclohexene ring.\n    *   The *exo* isomer, where the anhydride part points away from the ring system, is usually the thermodynamically more stable product but forms more slowly, making it the minor product.\n    *   Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the structure of the products and their predicted ¹H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Both the *endo* and *exo* products have the same molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Dienophile C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃), which matches the problem statement.\n    *   Both products have a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=C bond, the anhydride oxygen, and the CH₂ bridge. This symmetry simplifies the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n    *   Let's predict the key proton signals based on the structure of the adduct:\n        *   **Vinyl methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups are attached to the double bond of the product. They will appear as a single peak, integrating to 6H. Typical chemical shift for vinyl methyls is ~1.7-2.0 ppm. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons. These are on saturated carbons and should be more shielded (upfield). They will appear as a single peak, integrating to 6H. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride protons:** The two protons on the carbons that were originally part of maleic anhydride are equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring system. Their chemical shift would be relatively downfield. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridge protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ bridge are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the double bond, the other is *anti*). They should appear as two distinct signals, coupled to each other (i.e., two doublets). One of these is likely the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Use the NOESY information to distinguish between the major and minor products.**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product (*endo*)** and **absent in the minor product (*exo*)**. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   **In the *endo* isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is tucked *underneath* the bicyclic system. This brings the anhydride protons (the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the vinyl methyl groups (the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm) on the double bond above them. A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two groups.\n    *   **In the *exo* isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring is pointing *away* from the bicyclic system. The anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are now very far from the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). No NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   This observation perfectly matches the problem statement. The specific cross-peak that appears in the major (*endo*) product but not the minor (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the protons to the options.**\n    *   The protons involved are:\n        *   The vinyl methyl groups: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n        *   The anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n    *   These two resonances are connected by the unique cross-peak in the major product. This corresponds to option B.\n\nLet's check the other options for completeness:\n*   A) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm, vinyl Me): These groups are far apart in both isomers.\n*   C) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, bridge H): Their distance is similar in both isomers.\n*   D) 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, bridge H) and 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm, anhydride H): These are close in the *exo* (minor) product and far in the *endo* (major) product. This is the opposite of what is observed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7.0 ppm, and the ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   A single ¹H NMR peak indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The shift at 7.0 ppm is in the vinylic region.\n        *   Two ¹³C NMR peaks indicate two types of carbons. The shift at 137 ppm is typical for an alkene carbon (C=C), and 165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride.\n        *   The structure that perfectly fits this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). It has two equivalent vinylic protons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, consistent with the spectra. Its formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is stated to be **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. Let's verify its molecular formula is consistent with the product formula.\n        *   Product formula: C₁₃H₁₆O₃\n        *   Anhydride formula: C₄H₂O₃\n        *   Subtracting the anhydride from the product leaves the diene's contribution: C₁₃H₁₆O₃ - C₄H₂O₃ = C₉H₁₄.\n        *   Now let's determine the formula of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. A cyclopentadiene ring (C₅H₆) has methyl groups replacing hydrogens at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. This means the four hydrogens on the double-bonded carbons are replaced by methyl groups. The C5 carbon remains a CH₂ group. The formula is C₅H₂(CH₃)₄, which simplifies to C₉H₂₊₁₂ = C₉H₁₄.\n        *   The molecular formulas are consistent.\n\n2.  **The Reaction: Diels-Alder**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   According to the *endo rule*, the kinetically favored product is the *endo* adduct, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed ring. In this case, the C₂=C₃ double bond from the diene becomes a double bond within the new six-membered ring.\n    *   The reaction yields two products: a major and a minor one. The major product is the *endo* isomer, and the minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Structures and NOESY Spectra**\n    *   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n    *   The question states a key cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or very weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n4.  **Proton Assignments in the Product**\n    Let's analyze the protons in the product. The product (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride) has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (Hₐ):** There are two equivalent protons on the carbons that came from maleic anhydride. These are bridgehead-type protons on a saturated ring, alpha to carbonyl groups. A chemical shift of ~3.5 ppm is reasonable. Due to the symmetry and lack of adjacent protons (the bridgeheads are substituted with methyl groups), this signal should be a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **C7-Bridge Protons:** The C5 position of the original cyclopentadiene becomes the C7 bridge, which is a CH₂ group. The two protons are diastereotopic (one is *syn* and one is *anti* with respect to the C₂=C₃ double bond). They are not equivalent and will couple to each other, appearing as two **1H doublets**. Their chemical shifts are typically in the aliphatic region, ~1-2 ppm.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:**\n        *   There are two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These would give a **6H singlet** at a lower field, ~1.0 ppm.\n        *   There are two equivalent methyl groups on the vinylic carbons (C2 and C3). These would give a **6H singlet** at a slightly higher field than the other methyls due to the double bond, ~1.7 ppm.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Discriminating NOE**\n    Let's compare proton proximities in the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n    *   ***Endo* Isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side of the molecule as the C7-bridge. This places the anhydride protons (Hₐ) very close to one of the C7-bridge protons (specifically the one pointing away from the double bond, the *anti*-proton). A strong NOE is expected between them.\n    *   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the molecule from the C7-bridge. The anhydride protons (Hₐ) are now very far from both C7-bridge protons. No NOE is expected between them.\n\n    This Hₐ ↔ H(C7) interaction is the classic way to distinguish *endo* and *exo* isomers in Diels-Alder adducts of cyclopentadiene.\n\n6.  **Matching with the Options**\n\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is an interaction between a bridgehead methyl group and a C7 proton. This distance is fixed and should be present in both isomers.\n    *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This corresponds to the interaction between a C7-bridge proton (1H doublet, ~1.5 ppm) and the anhydride protons (2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm). This matches our analysis perfectly: this NOE should be present and strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This is an interaction between a vinylic methyl group and the anhydride protons. This interaction would also be stronger in the *endo* isomer, but the Hₐ ↔ H(C7) distance change is more dramatic and unambiguous.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This is an interaction between the two different types of methyl groups. Their relative distance is fixed and does not depend on the *endo*/*exo* stereochemistry.\n\n    The most definitive cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor is the one described in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Dicarboxylic acid and anhydride**: The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which upon dehydration forms an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR spectrum has a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   A single peak in the ¹H NMR means all protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n    *   Two peaks in the ¹³C NMR mean there are only two types of carbon atoms.\n    *   A chemical shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (vinyl protons) that are electron-deficient.\n    *   A chemical shift of ~165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon (C=O), and ~137 ppm is typical for an alkene carbon (C=C).\n    *   This information perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from maleic acid (a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid). It has two equivalent vinyl protons and two sets of equivalent carbons (two alkene carbons and two carbonyl carbons).\n*   **Diene**: The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene suitable for a Diels-Alder reaction. It has four methyl groups on the conjugated double bond system (C1 to C4) and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction**: The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n### 2. Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry\n*   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes typically produce two stereoisomeric products: an ***endo*** adduct and an ***exo*** adduct.\n*   The Alder rule states that the *endo* product is usually the major, kinetically-favored product, while the *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically-favored product (but formed more slowly).\n*   The problem states a major and a minor product are formed. We can assign the **major product as the *endo* isomer** and the **minor product as the *exo* isomer**.\n*   **Structure of the Adducts**: The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene framework.\n    *   The C5-CH₂ group of the diene becomes the C7 one-carbon bridge of the bicyclic system.\n    *   The original C1/C4 carbons of the diene (with their methyl groups) become the bridgehead carbons.\n    *   The original C2/C3 carbons of the diene (with their methyl groups) form the new double bond in the product.\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused to the remaining two carbons.\n*   **Stereochemical Difference**:\n    *   In the ***endo* adduct (major product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same side as the C7 bridge (*syn* to the bridge), causing it to be \"tucked under\" the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   In the ***exo* adduct (minor product)**, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge (*anti* to the bridge), pointing away from the rest of the bicyclic structure.\n\n### 3. Analyze the NOESY NMR Spectrum\n*   **NOESY**: This 2D NMR technique shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å), regardless of their through-bond connectivity.\n*   **The Differentiating Cross-Peak**: The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent (or weak) in the minor product's spectrum. This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships**:\n    *   Let's identify the key protons in the products:\n        *   **Anhydride protons (H_succinic)**: The two protons on the succinic anhydride ring. By symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **2H singlet**. Their chemical environment (alpha to two carbonyl groups) suggests a shift around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Vinyl methyl groups (Me_vinyl)**: The two equivalent methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond. Signal: **6H singlet**. Shift **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead methyl groups (Me_bridgehead)**: The two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4). Signal: **6H singlet**. Shift **~1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **C7-bridge protons**: The two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments, one *syn* to the C2=C3 double bond and one *anti*). They will appear as two separate signals, each a **1H doublet** (due to geminal coupling). The *syn* proton is closer to the double bond, and its signal is typically around **~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   **In the *endo* (major) product**: The anhydride ring is tucked under the bicyclic system, placing its protons (H_succinic) very close to the *syn* proton on the C7 bridge.\n    *   **In the *exo* (minor) product**: The anhydride ring points away from the bicyclic system, so its protons are far from all other protons, including the C7-bridge protons.\n*   **Conclusion**: The strong NOE cross-peak observed only for the major (*endo*) product must be between the **anhydride protons (H_succinic)** and the **C7-syn proton**.\n\n### 4. Match Analysis with the Given Options\nLet's match the interacting protons with the NMR data provided in the options:\n*   Interacting protons: **H_succinic** and **C7-syn proton**.\n*   Resonance for H_succinic: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   Resonance for C7-syn proton: **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_succinic). These protons are far apart in the *endo* isomer.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7-syn). The distance between these protons is fixed by the rigid frame and should be the same in both *endo* and *exo* isomers. An NOE here would not be unique to the major product.\n*   C) **A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7-syn) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_succinic).** This matches our analysis perfectly. These protons are close only in the major (*endo*) product.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl). The distance is the same in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the resonances of the C7-syn proton and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (Anhydride):** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak (δ=7 ppm) and two ¹³C NMR peaks (δ=137 ppm, δ=165 ppm).\n    *   The single ¹H peak indicates two equivalent vinylic protons. The shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons in an electron-deficient system.\n    *   The ¹³C peaks at 165 ppm and 137 ppm correspond to carbonyl carbons and alkene carbons, respectively, in an anhydride ring.\n    *   This highly symmetric structure is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    *   This is a cyclic, conjugated diene. The base formula for cyclopentadiene is C₅H₆. Replacing four hydrogens on the double-bond carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) with methyl groups gives a formula of C₅H₂ (from the ring) + 4×(CH₃) = C₉H₁₄.\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Diels-Alder reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   The reaction yields a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the problem statement.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. According to the endo rule, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored, major product. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically favored, minor product.\n    *   **Major product = *endo* adduct**\n    *   **Minor product = *exo* adduct**\n\n**2. Structure of the Products and Proton Assignments**\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the *endo* and *exo* products and assign the protons based on the provided NMR data.\n\nThe product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n*   The original maleic anhydride protons become two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are adjacent to carbonyls, so their chemical shift will be downfield. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** corresponds to these protons (**Hₐ**).\n*   The four methyl groups from the diene end up in two different environments in the product:\n    *   Two methyl groups are at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). These are tertiary alkyl methyls. The **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** corresponds to these bridgehead methyls (**Me_bh**).\n    *   Two methyl groups are on the double bond (C5 and C6). These are vinylic methyls. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** corresponds to these vinylic methyls (**Meᵥ**).\n*   The CH₂ group of the cyclopentadiene becomes the C7 methylene bridge of the bicyclic product. The two protons of this bridge are diastereotopic (they are in different chemical environments). They are designated as *syn* (pointing towards the double bond) and *anti* (pointing away from the double bond). The *syn* proton is typically shielded and appears at a higher field. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** is characteristic of one of these bridge protons (**H_syn**), being a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other bridge proton.\n\n**3. Analysis of the NOESY Spectra**\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) reveals protons that are close to each other in 3D space (< 5 Å). We need to find an NOE interaction that is present in the *endo* product (major) but absent in the *exo* product (minor).\n\n*   ***Endo* Adduct (Major Product):** In the *endo* conformation, the anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the main bicyclic framework, on the same side as the C7 bridge (*syn* to the bridge). This brings the anhydride protons (**Hₐ**) very close to the *syn* proton on the C7 bridge (**H_syn**). Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between **Hₐ** and **H_syn** is expected.\n\n*   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor Product):** In the *exo* conformation, the anhydride ring is oriented \"above\" the main bicyclic framework, on the opposite side of the C7 bridge (*anti* to the bridge). In this arrangement, the anhydride protons (**Hₐ**) are far from the C7 bridge protons. No NOE between **Hₐ** and **H_syn** is expected. Instead, the **Hₐ** protons are now close to the vinylic methyls (**Meᵥ**).\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. Based on our analysis, this unique cross-peak corresponds to the spatial interaction between the anhydride protons (**Hₐ**) and the *syn*-bridge proton (**H_syn**), which only occurs in the *endo* isomer.\n\n*   The signal for **Hₐ** is the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   The signal for **H_syn** is the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nThe question asks which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak. The correct answer must be the pair corresponding to these two signals.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (**Me_bh**) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (**H_syn**). Plausible interaction, but should be present in both isomers.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (**Me_bh**) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (**Meᵥ**). Plausible interaction, but should be present in both isomers.\nC) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (**H_syn**) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (**Hₐ**). This is the key NOE that is present only in the major (*endo*) product. This matches the question's description.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (**Meᵥ**) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (**Hₐ**). This NOE is characteristic of the minor (*exo*) product, not the major product.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride. This anhydride is the actual dienophile in the reaction.\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent protons on a double bond. The high chemical shift (7 ppm) is characteristic of protons on a double bond that are deshielded by adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (carbonyls). The singlet nature confirms their equivalence.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). The presence of only two peaks confirms a high degree of symmetry: the two alkene carbons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent.\n    *   Structure: These spectral data perfectly match **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid).\n\n    ```\n        O                O\n       // \\              // \\\n      C---C     - H₂O   C---C\n     / \\ / \\   ------>   \\ / \\ /\n    HO-C=O C=O-OH         C=O H\n                         /\n                        O\n    Maleic Acid        Maleic Anhydride\n    ```\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a cyclic diene with two conjugated double bonds (at positions 1 and 3) and methyl groups on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The remaining carbon of the ring is a CH₂ group (C5).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Product Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Diels-Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition between a conjugated diene and a dienophile. The reaction forms a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product Structure:** The reaction between cyclopentadiene (or its derivatives) and a dienophile results in a bridged bicyclic system, specifically a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Endo vs. Exo):** Diels-Alder reactions can form two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n    *   The **endo rule** predicts that the kinetic product (major product) is the one where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the bicyclic system. In this case, it means the anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the newly formed six-membered ring.\n    *   The **exo product** (thermodynamically more stable, but formed slower, thus the minor product) has the anhydride oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the bridge.\n    *   Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* isomer**, and the **minor product is the *exo* isomer**.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Major Product and Assign NMR Signals**\n\n*   Let's visualize the structure of the major (*endo*) product. It will have a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene skeleton (the new double bond is formed between C2 and C3 of the original diene).\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C7 bridge and the anhydride oxygen.\n    *   Let's identify the key proton groups based on the options provided:\n        1.  **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). They are equivalent due to symmetry. Expected signal: a **6H singlet**. Being standard tertiary alkyl methyls, they will be the most upfield signal, around **~1 ppm**.\n        2.  **Alkene Methyls:** Two methyl groups on the double bond (C2 and C3). They are also equivalent. Expected signal: a **6H singlet**. Being vinylic methyls, they are more deshielded than alkyl methyls, around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        3.  **Anhydride-Bridge Protons:** The two protons on the carbons that were part of the maleic anhydride double bond (now C5 and C6 of the bicyclic system). They are equivalent. They are alpha to carbonyl groups. Expected signal: a **2H singlet** at a downfield shift, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        4.  **C7 Bridge Protons:** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the C2=C3 double bond, one *anti*). They would give two separate signals, each coupling with the other (geminal coupling), appearing as a pair of doublets. A chemical shift of **~1.5 ppm** is reasonable for one of these protons.\n\n**4. Analyze the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY spectroscopy detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å), revealing through-space correlations.\n*   We are looking for a cross-peak **present in the major (*endo*) product** but **absent in the minor (*exo*) product**. This means we need to find a spatial proximity that is unique to the *endo* geometry.\n*   Let's compare the spatial arrangement in the two isomers:\n    *   ***Endo* Isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring, with its two protons (`H_anhydride_bridge`), is tucked under the C2=C3 double bond. This places the `H_anhydride_bridge` protons very close to the `Me_alkene` groups that are attached to the C2=C3 double bond. Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between these two groups is expected.\n    *   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is flipped away from the C2=C3 double bond. The `H_anhydride_bridge` protons are now far from the `Me_alkene` groups. The NOE interaction between them would be very weak or completely absent.\n\n**5. Match the Interaction with the Options**\n\n*   The key discriminating NOE interaction is between the **Alkene Methyls** and the **Anhydride-Bridge Protons**.\n*   Let's match these groups to their signals from step 3:\n    *   Alkene Methyls: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n    *   Anhydride-Bridge Protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   The cross-peak connects these two resonances. Now let's check the given options:\n\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7-H). This interaction would likely exist in both isomers.\n    B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7-H) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride_bridge). This is also a plausible *endo*-specific interaction, but the one in D involves more protons and rotating methyl groups, often leading to a stronger NOE.\n    C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene). These are adjacent on the ring skeleton; the interaction exists in both isomers.\n    D) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride_bridge).** This perfectly matches our analysis. This interaction is strong and characteristic of the *endo* isomer but absent in the *exo* isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (Anhydride):** We need to identify a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that, upon dehydration, forms an anhydride with specific NMR properties.\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent and are in the alkene region.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene region) and 165 ppm (carbonyl region). The presence of only two peaks implies a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   Let's consider maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid). Its dehydration product is maleic anhydride.\n        *   Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) possesses a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. This would lead to one ¹H signal and two ¹³C signals (one for the C=C carbons and one for the C=O carbons).\n        *   The chemical shifts match perfectly: ¹H protons of maleic anhydride are at ~7.1 ppm, the alkene carbons are at ~137 ppm, and the anhydride carbonyl carbons are at ~165 ppm.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The C5 carbon is a CH₂ group.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   The reaction can produce two stereoisomeric products: the **endo** adduct and the **exo** adduct. These are the major and minor products mentioned. The molecular formula of the adduct (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) is consistent with the combination of the diene (C₉H₁₄) and the dienophile (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n*   **The Spectroscopic Data:** We need to use 2D NOESY NMR to determine the structure of the major product.\n    *   A NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å), regardless of whether they are coupled through bonds.\n    *   A key cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product. This means this cross-peak represents a spatial proximity that is unique to the major isomer.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Endo vs. Exo Products and Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product has a bicyclic core.\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused to the main frame. The two protons from maleic anhydride (let's call them **H_fuse**) are now on saturated carbons. Due to a plane of symmetry in both endo and exo products, these two protons are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. The options suggest this is the signal at **~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The four methyl groups from the diene are now on the double bond of the bicyclic system. The plane of symmetry makes them fall into two sets: two methyls are *syn* to the C7 bridge, and two are *anti*. This should give two **6H singlets**. The options provide signals at **~1 ppm** and **~1.7 ppm** for these.\n    *   The CH₂ group from the diene becomes the C7 methylene bridge. Its two protons are diastereotopic and not relevant to the options involving singlets, but are likely the source of the \"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\".\n\n*   **Key Spatial Difference:** The crucial difference between the endo and exo products is the orientation of the fused anhydride ring.\n    *   **Exo Adduct:** The anhydride ring points 'up', away from the C7 bridge and on the same side as the *syn* face of the C2=C3 double bond. In this orientation, the **H_fuse** protons are spatially close to one set of the methyl groups.\n    *   **Endo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is tucked 'down', underneath the C2=C3 double bond and towards the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the **H_fuse** protons are far from the methyl groups but are close to the bridge protons on C7.\n\n*   **Identifying the Major Product:** The Alder Endo Rule states that the endo product is typically the kinetic major product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. However, this rule can be overridden by strong steric hindrance.\n    *   In this reaction, the diene has four bulky methyl groups. In the endo transition state, the incoming anhydride would clash severely with the methyl groups at positions C2 and C3.\n    *   The exo approach is much less sterically hindered. Due to this overwhelming steric factor, the **exo product is expected to be the major product** (it is both kinetically and thermodynamically favored).\n\n**3. Interpreting the NOESY Data**\n\n*   Since the **Exo adduct is the major product**, the unique cross-peak observed in its spectrum must correspond to the proximity unique to the exo geometry.\n*   As established, the unique proximity in the Exo adduct is between the **H_fuse** protons and the nearby **methyl groups**.\n*   The unique proximity in the minor Endo adduct would be between the **H_fuse** protons and the C7 bridge protons.\n*   The problem states the cross-peak is present in the major product. Therefore, it must be the NOE correlation between the H_fuse protons and a set of methyl protons.\n*   Let's match this to the signals given in the options:\n    *   Signal for H_fuse: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   Signal for one of the methyl sets: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (or the one at ~1.0 ppm).\n*   The NOESY cross-peak connects these two signals.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak in the major (Exo) product's NOESY spectrum connects the resonance for the two equivalent protons on the fused ring portion (H_fuse) with the resonance for the six equivalent protons of the nearby methyl group set. Option D describes exactly this correlation.\n\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** NOE between the two methyl groups. Likely present in both isomers.\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** NOE between a bridge proton and H_fuse. This would be characteristic of the minor (Endo) product.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** NOE between a methyl group and a bridge proton. Likely present in both isomers.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** NOE between a methyl group and H_fuse. This is characteristic of the major (Exo) product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Dienophile:**\n    *   The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride.\n    *   This anhydride has a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   A single ¹H NMR peak indicates that all protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. A chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of alkene protons.\n    *   The two ¹³C NMR peaks correspond to the alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and the carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm).\n    *   This specific set of data uniquely identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry that makes its two alkene protons equivalent and its two alkene carbons equivalent, as well as its two carbonyl carbons equivalent. Its molecular formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n\n2.  **Identify the Diene and Analyze Stoichiometry:**\n    *   The diene is given as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Let's determine its structure and formula. It's a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4, and methyl groups attached to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. The carbon at position 5 is a CH₂ group. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₂.\n    *   The product of a simple Diels-Alder reaction between the diene (C₉H₁₂) and the dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) would be C₁₃H₁₄O₃ (C₉H₁₂ + C₄H₂O₃).\n    *   However, the problem explicitly states the molecular formula of the products is **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This product has two more hydrogen atoms than the expected Diels-Alder adduct.\n    *   This discrepancy implies that the Diels-Alder reaction is followed by a reduction step, specifically the hydrogenation of the remaining double bond in the bicyclic adduct.\n    *   So, the reaction sequence is:\n        1.  Diels-Alder: C₉H₁₂ + C₄H₂O₃ → C₁₃H₁₄O₃ (endo/exo isomers)\n        2.  Hydrogenation: C₁₃H₁₄O₃ + H₂ → C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (saturated endo/exo isomers)\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclic diene and a dienophile typically yields two stereoisomers: the *endo* product (major, kinetically favored) and the *exo* product (minor, thermodynamically favored).\n    *   **Major Product (derived from *endo* adduct):** In the initial *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the one-carbon bridge (the C7-CH₂ group). The double bond in this adduct is sterically hindered from the *endo* face by the anhydride ring itself. Therefore, catalytic hydrogenation (addition of H₂) will occur from the less hindered *exo* face. This pushes the two methyl groups that were on the double bond into the *endo* position. The final major product has both the anhydride ring's protons and the two methyl groups on the C5-C6 bridge in the *endo* position.\n    *   **Minor Product (derived from *exo* adduct):** In the initial *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7-CH₂ bridge. Now, the *exo* face of the double bond is hindered by the anhydride ring. Hydrogenation will occur from the *endo* face. This pushes the two methyl groups into the *exo* position. The final minor product has both the anhydride ring's protons and the methyl groups on the C5-C6 bridge in the *exo* position.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are coupled through bonds.\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent (or weak) in the minor product's spectrum. We need to find a pair of protons that are close only in the major isomer.\n    *   **In the major product (hydrogenated *endo* adduct):** As determined above, the protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule are *endo*, and the methyl groups on the C5-C6 part of the skeleton are also *endo*. Due to the rigid, cage-like structure of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane system, these two sets of *endo* groups are forced into close proximity. Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **In the minor product (hydrogenated *exo* adduct):** The corresponding protons (on the anhydride) and methyl groups are both in the *exo* position. In the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework, *exo* groups on the C2/C3 bridge and the C5/C6 bridge are on opposite sides of the molecule and far apart. Thus, no significant NOE cross-peak is expected.\n    *   This analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Identify the Cross-Peak:**\n    *   We need to identify the signals for the two groups involved in the NOE of the major product.\n    *   **Signal 1: The protons on the anhydride ring.** The product has a plane of symmetry, making these two protons equivalent. They are attached to carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. Their chemical shift would be relatively high, around 3.0-4.0 ppm. The integral would be 2H. Looking at the options, **a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is a perfect match.\n    *   **Signal 2: The methyl groups at the C5 and C6 positions.** The symmetry plane also makes these two methyl groups equivalent. They are on saturated (sp³) carbons in a strained ring. Their signal would be a singlet with an integral of 6H. A typical chemical shift for such methyl groups is around 1-2 ppm. From the options, **a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is the most reasonable assignment. (The other 6H singlet at ~1 ppm likely corresponds to the bridgehead methyl groups, which are in a different chemical environment).\n    *   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak in the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (endo methyls) and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (endo anhydride protons).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The choice that matches this conclusion is: **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Anhydride Reactant**\n\n1.  The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n2.  The resulting anhydride's ¹H NMR spectrum has a single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak means all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (vinylic protons).\n3.  The anhydride's ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks: 165 ppm and 137 ppm. The peak at ~165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride. The peak at ~137 ppm is typical for a vinylic carbon.\n4.  For all protons to be equivalent and all vinylic carbons to be equivalent, and all carbonyl carbons to be equivalent, the molecule must be highly symmetrical.\n5.  The simplest structure that fits all this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). It has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. This perfectly matches the provided NMR data.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Reaction and Diene**\n\n1.  The anhydride (maleic anhydride) is reacted with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n2.  Maleic anhydride is an excellent dienophile (due to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene is a diene.\n3.  The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products**\n\n1.  The Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclic diene (cyclopentadiene derivative) and a dienophile can form two stereoisomers: an *endo* product and an *exo* product.\n2.  According to the **endo rule**, the product where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are tucked \"under\" the newly formed six-membered ring is the kinetically favored product. This means the **endo product is the major product**. The *exo* product, where the anhydride group points away, is the thermodynamically favored but kinetically slower-forming product, making it the **minor product**.\n3.  Let's visualize the structures:\n    *   The core structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n    *   The double bond of this system is substituted with four methyl groups (from the diene). For the purpose of analyzing the NOESY data, we can consider them as two sets: two methyl groups pointing \"up\" and two \"down\", but for simplicity, the crucial part is their location on the double bond. Wait, let's re-examine the diene. 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The double bonds are C1=C2 and C3=C4. Methyls are on C1, C2, C3, and C4. In the Diels-Alder reaction, the new double bond forms between the original C2 and C3. So the new double bond will have two methyl groups on it. The original C1 and C4 become the bridgehead carbons, and they will each have a methyl group.\n    *   The succinic anhydride ring is fused to the molecule.\n    *   Let's identify the key protons:\n        *   **Protons on the anhydride part (H_anhydride):** Two equivalent protons on the five-membered anhydride ring. Let's predict their signal: adjacent to carbonyls, they will be downfield, likely a **2H singlet around 3-4 ppm**.\n        *   **Methyl groups on the double bond (Me_vinylic):** Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond. Their signal will be a **6H singlet around 1.5-2.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (Me_bridgehead):** Two equivalent methyl groups on saturated carbons. Their signal will be a **6H singlet, upfield, around 1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Methylene bridge protons (H_bridge):** Two diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ bridge. They would likely form a complex multiplet (an AB quartet), probably in the 1-2 ppm range.\n    *   **Spatial Relationships in the Isomers:**\n        *   **Endo product (major):** The anhydride ring is on the same face as the double bond. Therefore, **H_anhydride are close in space to Me_vinylic**.\n        *   **Exo product (minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite face of the double bond. Therefore, **H_anhydride are far from Me_vinylic**. They are instead close to the H_bridge protons.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the NOESY Data and Answer the Question**\n\n1.  A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n2.  The problem states: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\"\n3.  This means we are looking for a pair of proton signals corresponding to protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n4.  Based on our analysis in Step 3, the pair of protons that fits this description is **H_anhydride and Me_vinylic**.\n5.  Now, we match these proton groups to the signals described in the options:\n    *   **H_anhydride** corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Me_vinylic** corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n6.  The question asks which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak. The answer is the resonance for H_anhydride and the resonance for Me_vinylic.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Option**\n\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinylic):** These are far apart in both isomers.\n*   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (one H_bridge):** These are likely close in both isomers. This cross-peak would not distinguish between major and minor.\n*   **C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (one H_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride):** These are close in the minor (*exo*) product, not the major (*endo*) product. This is the opposite of the observation.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinylic) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride):** These are close in the major (*endo*) product and far in the minor (*exo*) product. This perfectly matches the experimental description.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and the Reaction.**\n    *   The first reactant is described as a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene which dehydrates to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is given: a single peak at 7 ppm in ¹H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in ¹³C NMR.\n        *   The dehydration of a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid like maleic acid yields maleic anhydride.\n        *   Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry. The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, which would give a single peak in the ¹H NMR. The value of ~7 ppm is characteristic of deshielded alkene protons adjacent to carbonyl groups.\n        *   It also has two types of carbons: two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). This would give two signals in the ¹³C NMR. The shifts of ~137 ppm (alkene) and ~165 ppm (carbonyl) are consistent with this structure.\n        *   Therefore, the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry.**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring. When a cyclic diene reacts with a dienophile, it forms a bicyclic system. In this case, the product is a derivative of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene.\n    *   The molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ is consistent with the addition of C₉H₁₄ (the diene) and C₄H₂O₃ (the anhydride).\n    *   The reaction can produce two diastereomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct. This accounts for the major and minor products mentioned.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** Typically, the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital overlap in the transition state. The *endo* product is the kinetic product.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance Exception:** However, the diene used here is heavily substituted with four methyl groups. In the *endo* transition state, where the dienophile (maleic anhydride) tucks \"under\" the diene, there would be significant steric repulsion between the anhydride and the methyl groups on the diene. In such cases of severe steric hindrance, the *exo* transition state is lower in energy, and the *exo* product becomes the major product. This is a crucial exception to the general endo rule.\n    *   Therefore, we can hypothesize:\n        *   **Major product = *Exo* isomer**\n        *   **Minor product = *Endo* isomer**\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products and Predict the NMR Signals.**\n    *   Let's analyze the general structure of the product: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride. Due to a plane of symmetry passing through the C7 bridge and the middle of the C2=C3 and C5-C6 bonds, several groups of protons are equivalent.\n    *   We expect the following signals in the ¹H NMR:\n        *   **`Me(alkene)`:** The methyl groups on the double bond (at C2 and C3) are equivalent. They would appear as a **6H singlet**. Vinylic methyls typically resonate around 1.6-2.0 ppm.\n        *   **`Me(bridgehead)`:** The methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (at C1 and C4) are equivalent. They would appear as another **6H singlet**. These alkyl methyls would resonate further upfield, around 1.0 ppm.\n        *   **`H(anhydride)`:** The protons on the anhydride part of the ring (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. They are alpha to carbonyl groups and are deshielded. They should appear as a **2H singlet**, likely downfield (~3-4 ppm).\n        *   **`H(bridge)`:** The two protons of the CH₂ group at C7 are diastereotopic and would give more complex signals, likely two separate 1H multiplets.\n    *   Matching the expected signals with those in the options:\n        *   `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm` corresponds to **`Me(alkene)`**.\n        *   `6H singlet at ~1 ppm` corresponds to **`Me(bridgehead)`**.\n        *   `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` corresponds to **`H(anhydride)`**.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Data.**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a key cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. We need to find a pair of protons whose spatial proximity is different in the *exo* and *endo* isomers.\n    *   **Exo Isomer (Major Product):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (away) from the C7 bridge. This places the anhydride protons `H(anhydride)` on the same face of the bicyclic system as the C2=C3 double bond. Consequently, the `H(anhydride)` protons are **close** to the **`Me(alkene)`** groups. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **Endo Isomer (Minor Product):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (towards) the C7 bridge. This places the `H(anhydride)` protons on the opposite face from the C2=C3 double bond. The `H(anhydride)` protons are **far** from the **`Me(alkene)`** groups. No NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   This analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation: the cross-peak is present in the major (*exo*) product and absent in the minor (*endo*) product. The cross-peak is between the `H(anhydride)` protons and the `Me(alkene)` protons.\n\n5.  **Identify the Final Answer.**\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects the `H(anhydride)` protons and the `Me(alkene)` protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignments in step 3:\n        *   `H(anhydride)` resonates as a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n        *   `Me(alkene)` resonates as a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   We need to find the option that lists these two resonances.\n\n    *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\n    Option D correctly identifies the two resonances that are connected by the unique cross-peak in the major product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a Diels-Alder reaction and the interpretation of NMR data, specifically a 2D NOESY spectrum, to determine the structure of the major product.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants\n\n*   **Dienophile:** We are given a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which dehydrates to an anhydride. The anhydride has a very simple NMR spectrum:\n    *   ¹H NMR: one peak at 7 ppm. The high chemical shift is characteristic of alkene protons deshielded by electron-withdrawing groups (the anhydride carbonyls). A single peak means the protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). Two peaks imply that the two alkene carbons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent.\n    *   This description perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**, which is formed by the dehydration of *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). The two alkene protons are equivalent due to the molecule's C₂ᵥ symmetry.\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring with two conjugated double bonds.\n    *   Methyl groups are attached to all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4).\n    *   The fifth carbon (C5) is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n### Step 2: The Diels-Alder Reaction and its Products\n\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n*   The reaction between a cyclic diene and a substituted dienophile can yield two major stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** The Diels-Alder reaction is typically under kinetic control, favoring the formation of the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene and the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile during the transition state. Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* isomer**, and the minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n*   Let's visualize the structures:\n    *   **Product Skeleton:** A bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core is formed. The C5-CH₂ group of the diene becomes the C7 bridge of the product. A new six-membered ring is formed, containing a double bond between the original C2 and C3 of the diene.\n    *   **Substituents:**\n        *   Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4).\n        *   Two methyl groups on the alkene carbons (C2, C3).\n        *   An anhydride ring fused at C5 and C6. The two protons from maleic anhydride are on these carbons.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:**\n        *   ***Endo* product (major):** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side) to the C7-CH₂ bridge. The two protons on the anhydride part are therefore *anti* (on the opposite side) to the bridge and point \"up\" towards the C2=C3 double bond.\n        *   ***Exo* product (minor):** The anhydride ring is positioned *anti* to the C7-CH₂ bridge. The two protons on the anhydride part are therefore *syn* to the bridge and point \"down\" away from the C2=C3 double bond.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the NOESY Spectrum\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å apart). A cross-peak appears between the signals of two protons that have a mutual NOE.\n*   The problem states a crucial fact: a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n*   Let's analyze the spatial proximities in each isomer:\n    *   ***Endo* isomer (major):** The two anhydride protons (let's call them H_anhydride) point towards the C2=C3 double bond. They are spatially close to the methyl groups attached to this double bond (let's call them Me_alkene). A strong NOE is expected between H_anhydride and Me_alkene.\n    *   ***Exo* isomer (minor):** The H_anhydride protons point away from the double bond. They are far from the Me_alkene groups. No significant NOE is expected between them. Instead, the H_anhydride protons are now close to the *syn* proton of the C7-CH₂ bridge.\n\n*   The observed NOE (present in major, absent in minor) must therefore be between **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n\n### Step 4: Assign NMR Signals and Match to Options\n\nNow, we need to predict the ¹H NMR signals for these protons.\n*   **H_anhydride protons:** These are two equivalent protons on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. They are significantly deshielded. A chemical shift around **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable. Due to the molecule's symmetry and typical dihedral angles in this system, the coupling to bridgehead protons is often negligible, leading to a **singlet**. The integral is for **2H**. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Me_alkene protons:** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinylic methyls). Their chemical shift is typically in the range of 1.7-2.1 ppm. They are equivalent and have no protons on adjacent carbons to couple with, so they will appear as a **singlet**. The integral is for **6H**. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Other protons for comparison:**\n    *   **Me_bridgehead protons:** Two equivalent methyl groups on saturated bridgehead carbons. They are shielded and would appear at a lower chemical shift, around **~1.0 ppm**, as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   **CH₂ bridge protons:** These two protons are typically inequivalent and would show a more complex pattern (e.g., an AB quartet or two doublets) around ~1.5 ppm.\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak connects the signal for H_anhydride with the signal for Me_alkene. Based on our assignments, this is the cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect proton group/integral.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This perfectly matches our analysis.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect proton groups.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be an NOE between the bridgehead methyls and the alkene methyls. This interaction would exist in both *endo* and *exo* isomers and therefore does not fit the problem description.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the resonances for the vinylic methyl groups and the protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (indicating two equivalent vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl C=O). This is characteristic of maleic acid being dehydrated to maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride is a symmetric molecule, which accounts for the simple NMR spectra.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system at carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each of these carbons has a methyl group. Carbon 5 is a methylene (CH₂) group. This diene is also symmetric.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   This reaction is stereospecific and typically produces two stereoisomers when a cyclic diene is used: the *endo* product and the *exo* product.\n    *   According to the Alder rule, Diels-Alder reactions under kinetic control (which is the usual case) favor the formation of the *endo* product. Therefore, the *endo* adduct is the major product, and the *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products and Their Symmetry:**\n    *   The reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene framework with a fused anhydride ring.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of both the diene and the dienophile, the products (*endo* and *exo*) will each possess a plane of symmetry (Cₛ). This symmetry plane bisects the C=C double bond, the C7 methylene bridge, and the anhydride group.\n    *   This symmetry makes pairs of protons and methyl groups chemically equivalent. In the ¹H NMR spectrum, we expect to see:\n        *   One singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C5, C6). Let's call these **Me_alkene**. These are vinylic methyls and should have a chemical shift around 1.6-2.0 ppm. This is a **6H singlet**.\n        *   One singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4). Let's call these **Me_bridgehead**. These are methyls on saturated carbons and should appear upfield, around 1.0-1.3 ppm. This is another **6H singlet**.\n        *   One singlet for the two equivalent protons on the carbons carrying the anhydride ring (C2, C3). Let's call these **H_anhydride**. These protons are alpha to two carbonyl groups and should be downfield, around 3-4 ppm. This is a **2H singlet**.\n        *   The two protons of the C7 methylene bridge (H_syn and H_anti) are diastereotopic. They will couple to each other, giving rise to two **1H doublets** (an AB quartet), unless they are accidentally isochronous (have the same chemical shift).\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find an interaction that is unique to the *endo* geometry.\n    *   Let's visualize the 3D structures:\n        *   In the **endo adduct (major product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the C5-C6 double bond. This arrangement brings the **H_anhydride** protons (at C2 and C3) very close to the **Me_alkene** groups (at C5 and C6). A strong NOE between these two groups is expected.\n        *   In the **exo adduct (minor product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the C5-C6 double bond. This moves the **H_anhydride** protons far from the **Me_alkene** groups. Therefore, the corresponding NOE would be absent or very weak.\n    *   This confirms that the distinguishing cross-peak connects the **H_anhydride** protons and the **Me_alkene** protons.\n\n5.  **Match the Analysis to the Options:**\n    *   The cross-peak connects the signal for H_anhydride with the signal for Me_alkene.\n    *   Signal for H_anhydride: A **2H singlet** with a chemical shift around 3.5 ppm.\n    *   Signal for Me_alkene: A **6H singlet** with a chemical shift around 1.7 ppm.\n    *   Now we look at the choices:\n        *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\n    *   Option C perfectly matches our findings: a cross-peak between the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene) and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride). The chemical shifts are also very plausible for these groups.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene, which dehydrates to an anhydride. The anhydride's spectral data are key:\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent protons in the vinylic region (C=C-H).\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon, C=O).\n        *   The high symmetry (one proton signal, two carbon signals) and the nature of the precursor (*cis*-dicarboxylic acid) point unequivocally to **maleic anhydride**. It has a C₂ᵥ symmetry axis, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. The two sp² carbons of the double bond are also equivalent. Thus, we expect one ¹H signal and two ¹³C signals, which perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Diene:** This is explicitly given as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile.\n    *   This reaction is stereospecific and stereoselective. It typically yields two major stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and the *exo* adducts.\n    *   **Alder's Endo Rule:** For kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is favored. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the π-system of the diene and the unsaturated substituents on the dienophile in the transition state. The major product mentioned in the problem is the *endo* adduct, and the minor product is the *exo* adduct.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Structures (Endo vs. Exo):**\n    *   The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. Let's map the atoms from the reactants to the product:\n        *   The C1 and C4 of the diene become the bridgehead carbons of the product. They each bear a methyl group.\n        *   The C2 and C3 of the diene become the carbons of the new double bond (C5=C6 in standard norbornene nomenclature). They each bear a methyl group.\n        *   The C5 of the diene (a -CH₂- group) becomes the single-carbon C7 bridge.\n        *   The maleic anhydride moiety adds across the diene to form the C2-C3 part of the product, containing the two protons and the fused anhydride ring.\n    *   **The crucial definition of *endo* and *exo* in this system:** The *endo* position is *syn* (on the same face) to the longer bridge, which is the two-carbon C5=C6 bridge with the methyl groups. The *exo* position is *anti* to this bridge (and thus *syn* to the shorter C7 methylene bridge).\n    *   **Major Product (Endo):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C5=C6 double bond. This places the protons of the anhydride part (let's call them H_A) in close spatial proximity to the methyl groups on the double bond (let's call them Me_vinyl).\n    *   **Minor Product (Exo):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C5=C6 double bond. This places the H_A protons far from the Me_vinyl groups. Instead, they are close to the protons on the C7 bridge.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**. This must be the correlation that is unique to the *endo* geometry.\n    *   Based on our structural analysis in step 3, the unique spatial proximity in the major (*endo*) product is between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the vinylic methyl groups (Me_vinyl).\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in question connects the NMR signals for H_A and Me_vinyl.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Match to Options:**\n    *   Let's analyze the signals given in the options based on their integration and typical chemical shifts:\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This corresponds to the two equivalent anhydride protons (H_A). The chemical shift is reasonable for protons alpha to two carbonyl groups in a strained ring.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent vinylic methyl groups (Me_vinyl). The shift is characteristic for methyl groups attached to a double bond.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** This corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent bridgehead methyl groups. Methyl groups on saturated (sp³) carbons typically appear further upfield.\n        *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is likely one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge.\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major product is between H_A (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) and Me_vinyl (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet).\n    *   This correlation is described in option C.\n\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Bridgehead methyls and vinylic methyls. These are on opposite \"ends\" of the C1-C2-C3-C4 part of the ring and are too far apart.\n    *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** A bridge proton and the anhydride protons. This interaction would be characteristic of the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons. This matches our prediction for the major (*endo*) product.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** The bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton. This interaction is plausible but is not the key differentiator between the endo and exo isomers in the same way.\n\nThe correct answer is the option describing the spatial proximity unique to the major (*endo*) product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is given:\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   The symmetry suggested by a single ¹H peak for alkene protons points to a symmetrical molecule. The chemical shifts are characteristic of maleic anhydride. Maleic acid is the *cis*-dicarboxylic acid, and its dehydration product is maleic anhydride.\n    *   In maleic anhydride, the two alkene protons are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry, giving one singlet in the ¹H NMR spectrum. Their chemical shift around 7 ppm is expected due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   The two alkene carbons are equivalent (around 137 ppm), and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent (around 165 ppm). This matches the ¹³C NMR data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 and 3. There are four methyl groups on carbons C1, C2, C3, and C4. The remaining carbon, C5, is a methylene group (CH₂).\n\n**2. The Reaction: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   The reaction forms a bridged bicyclic product. The resulting skeleton is based on bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction can form two diastereomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* product is formed faster and is usually the major product under kinetic control (lower temperatures, shorter reaction times). The *exo* product is more thermodynamically stable and would be the major product under thermodynamic control (higher temperatures, longer reaction times). The problem statement implies a kinetic mixture by mentioning \"a major and a minor product,\" so it's safe to assume:\n        *   **Major product = Endo adduct**\n        *   **Minor product = Exo adduct**\n*   **Product Structure:** The molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ matches the sum of the reactants (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Anhydride C₄H₂O₃). The product is 1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride. Both isomers have a plane of symmetry.\n\n**3. Analyze the Product Structure and Predict ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nDue to the plane of symmetry in both isomers, we expect the following signals:\n*   **Two vinylic methyl groups (at C5, C6):** Equivalent, giving a **6H singlet**. These are on sp² carbons, so they will be somewhat deshielded (~1.7 ppm).\n*   **Two bridgehead methyl groups (at C1, C4):** Equivalent, giving a **6H singlet**. These are on sp³ carbons, so they will be more shielded (~1.0 ppm).\n*   **Two anhydride methine protons (at C2, C3):** Equivalent, giving a **2H singlet**. They are alpha to carbonyl groups and will be significantly deshielded (~3.5 ppm).\n*   **Two bridge methylene protons (at C7):** These are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They will appear as two separate signals, each integrating to 1H, and they will be coupled to each other (geminal coupling), likely forming an AB quartet (appearing as two doublets). A chemical shift of ~1.5 ppm for one of them is reasonable.\n\n**4. Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY shows correlations between protons that are close in space (< 5Å).\n*   The key information is: **A cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor product.**\n*   We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer (major product) but far apart in the *exo* isomer (minor product).\n\n*   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C7 bridge.\n    *   In this conformation, the anhydride methine protons (at C2, C3, signal at ~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the C7-bridge proton that is *anti* to the double bond. A strong NOE is expected between these protons.\n\n*   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is pointing \"away\" from the C7 bridge.\n    *   In this conformation, the anhydride methine protons (~3.5 ppm) are far from both C7-bridge protons. Therefore, the corresponding NOE cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n*   This analysis directly matches the experimental observation. The distinguishing cross-peak connects the anhydride protons with one of the C7-bridge protons.\n\n**5. Match the Analysis to the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on our analysis:\n*   The resonances involved are:\n    1.  The anhydride methine protons: a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    2.  One of the C7-bridge protons: a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n*   Now check the options:\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: (Bridgehead Me <-> Vinylic Me). These are far apart.\n    B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: (Vinylic Me <-> Anhydride H). This interaction is strong in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) one. This contradicts the data.\n    C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: (Bridgehead Me <-> Bridge H). This interaction is likely present in both isomers and is not the unique distinguishing feature.\n    D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: (Bridge H <-> Anhydride H). This perfectly matches our finding. This NOE is strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid anhydride derived from a *cis*-alkene. Its ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl). This perfectly matches the spectral data for **maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃)**. The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry, giving a singlet at ~7 ppm. The two alkene carbons are equivalent (~137 ppm), and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent (~165 ppm).\n    *   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄)**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4) and methyl groups attached to each of these four carbons. The C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic product.\n    *   The problem states that two products, a major and a minor one, are formed. In Diels-Alder reactions, this typically corresponds to the formation of *endo* and *exo* stereoisomers. According to the endo rule, the *endo* adduct is usually the kinetically favored (major) product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structures and NMR Signals:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between these two reactants forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   The CH₂ group of the cyclopentadiene becomes the one-carbon bridge (C7) of the bicyclic system.\n    *   The four methyl groups from the diene are now located at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and the vinylic positions (C2, C3) of the new product.\n    *   The anhydride moiety is fused to carbons C5 and C6. The two protons originally on the maleic anhydride are now on C5 and C6.\n    *   Both the *endo* and *exo* products possess a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2=C3 bond, the C7 bridge, and the anhydride group. This symmetry has important consequences for the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n        *   The two bridgehead methyl groups (at C1 and C4) are equivalent and will appear as a single 6H singlet. These are on sp³ carbons and would be upfield, around **~1 ppm**. Let's call them **Me_b**.\n        *   The two vinylic methyl groups (at C2 and C3) are equivalent and will appear as a single 6H singlet. These are on sp² carbons and would be more downfield, around **~1.7 ppm**. Let's call them **Me_v**.\n        *   The two protons on the anhydride-fused part (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. They are not coupled to adjacent protons (C1 and C4 have methyl groups, not protons). They will appear as a 2H singlet. Being adjacent to the electron-withdrawing anhydride group, they will be significantly downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**. Let's call them **H5/H6**.\n        *   The two protons on the C7 bridge (H7) are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the C2=C3 double bond, one is *anti*). They will appear as two distinct signals, likely two 1H doublets due to geminal coupling. They are on a saturated carbon, so their chemical shifts would be in the aliphatic region, plausibly around **~1.5 ppm** for one of them. Let's call them **H7_syn** and **H7_anti**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Data to Distinguish Isomers:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between nuclei that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\"\n    *   Major product = *endo* adduct.\n    *   Minor product = *exo* adduct.\n    *   We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n5.  **Compare Spatial Proximities in *Endo* and *Exo* Adducts:**\n    *   ***Endo* Adduct:** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C2=C3 double bond. The protons H5 and H6 are in the *exo* position, meaning they point away from the double bond and towards the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the *exo*-H5/H6 protons are close to the *anti*-H7 proton (the one on the C7 bridge that also points away from the double bond).\n    *   ***Exo* Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge, pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond. The protons H5 and H6 are in the *endo* position, pointing \"under\" the C1-C6/C4-C5 bonds towards the C2=C3 double bond. In this orientation, H5/H6 are now far from the *anti*-H7 proton but are close to the *syn*-H7 proton and the vinylic methyls (Me_v).\n\n    **Conclusion:** The key differentiating NOE is the one between **H5/H6** and the ***anti*-H7 proton**. This NOE will be strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent or very weak in the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n6.  **Match the Finding to the Answer Choices:**\n    *   The interacting protons are H5/H6 and one of the H7 protons (specifically H7_anti).\n    *   The resonance for H5/H6 is the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   The resonance for one of the H7 protons is a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n\n    Let's check the options:\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_b) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_v): An NOE between these is expected in both isomers.\n    B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_v) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H5/H6): An NOE is expected for the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) one.\n    C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_b) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H7 proton): An NOE is plausible in both isomers between Me_b and H7_anti.\n    D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H7 proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H5/H6): This corresponds to the H7_anti to H5/H6 interaction that is uniquely strong in the *endo* (major) product.\n\nThis perfectly matches our analysis.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the reaction type.**\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is given: ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   Maleic acid is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Its dehydration yields maleic anhydride.\n    *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃). Due to the molecule's symmetry (a C₂v point group), the two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, and the two alkene carbons are equivalent, as are the two carbonyl carbons.\n    *   ¹H NMR: The two equivalent vinyl protons would give a single peak. Being on a double bond conjugated to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, their chemical shift would be significantly downfield, around 7 ppm. This matches the data.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: We expect two signals. One for the two equivalent vinyl carbons (C=C) and one for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). Alkene carbons are typically 100-150 ppm (137 ppm fits well), and carbonyl carbons are 160-200 ppm (165 ppm fits well).\n    *   Conclusion: The dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene (C₉H₁₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure and stereochemistry of the products.**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction between maleic anhydride and the substituted cyclopentadiene will form a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system with an anhydride ring fused to it.\n*   The molecular formula of the product would be C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride) + C₉H₁₄ (diene) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem, confirming our structural assignment.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two main stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The **Endo Rule** states that for kinetically controlled reactions (which are typical for Diels-Alder), the *endo* product is favored. In the *endo* product, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed bicyclic system, which is the C=C double bond in this case. In simpler terms, the anhydride is tucked \"underneath\" the new double bond.\n    *   The *exo* product is typically the thermodynamically more stable but kinetically disfavored product.\n    *   Therefore, it is standard to assume: **Major Product = Endo isomer** and **Minor Product = Exo isomer**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the expected NOESY correlations for the Endo and Exo isomers.**\n*   The Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) is a through-space interaction observed between protons that are physically close to each other (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak in a 2D NOESY spectrum indicates such proximity.\n*   The question describes a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**. We must find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   Let's identify the key proton groups in the product and estimate their chemical shifts:\n    *   **Ha:** The two protons on the anhydride part of the structure. They are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry in the product. They are alpha to carbonyl groups and part of a strained ring, so they will be deshielded. A reasonable estimate is ~3-4 ppm. The `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` is a perfect match for these protons.\n    *   **Mv (Vinyl methyls):** The two methyl groups on the C=C double bond (from C2 and C3 of the diene). They are equivalent by symmetry. Their protons (6H total) will appear as a singlet. Vinylic methyls typically resonate around 1.5-2.0 ppm. The `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm` is a good assignment.\n    *   **Mb (Bridgehead methyls):** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (from C1 and C4 of the diene). They are also equivalent by symmetry. As methyls on saturated carbons, they will be the most shielded. The `6H singlet at ~1 ppm` fits well.\n    *   **H-bridge:** The two protons on the C7 methylene bridge (from C5 of the diene). These two protons (`syn` and `anti` to the double bond) are diastereotopic and should have different chemical shifts and couple to each other. The `1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm` corresponds to one of these bridge protons.\n\n*   **Spatial relationships:**\n    *   **In the Endo (major) product:** The anhydride ring (with Ha protons) is tucked underneath the C2=C3 double bond. This brings the **Ha** protons close to the **Mv** (vinyl methyl) groups. The Ha protons are also close to the *syn*-proton of the C7 bridge.\n    *   **In the Exo (minor) product:** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond. The **Ha** protons are now far from the **Mv** groups and the *syn*-proton of the C7 bridge. Instead, they are closer to the bridgehead methyl groups (Mb).\n\n*   **Conclusion:** A NOESY cross-peak between **Ha** and **Mv** is expected to be **strong in the endo isomer** and **absent in the exo isomer**. This exactly matches the description in the problem.\n\n**Step 4: Match the conclusion with the given options.**\n*   We need the cross-peak connecting the resonances for **Ha** and **Mv**.\n*   Based on our assignments:\n    *   Resonance for **Ha** is the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`.\n    *   Resonance for **Mv** is the `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm`.\n*   This corresponds to the pair described in option C.\n\nLet's check the other options:\n*   A) `Mb (~1 ppm)` and `Mv (~1.7 ppm)`: These groups are not particularly close in either isomer.\n*   B) `H-bridge (~1.5 ppm)` and `Ha (~3.5 ppm)`: This interaction (specifically with the *syn*-bridge proton) is also expected in the endo isomer but not the exo. However, the interaction between Ha and Mv (Option C) is the most direct consequence of the secondary orbital interactions that define the endo selectivity of the Diels-Alder reaction, making it the most characteristic cross-peak.\n*   D) `Mb (~1 ppm)` and `H-bridge (~1.5 ppm)`: An NOE between a bridgehead methyl and a C7 proton might exist, but it would not be the key differentiating peak between the endo and exo isomers in the same way as those involving the mobile anhydride ring protons.\n\nTherefore, the most logical and chemically significant cross-peak that distinguishes the major (endo) from the minor (exo) product is the one between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl groups.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants.**\n    *   **The Dienophile**: We are given a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in the ¹H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in the ¹³C NMR.\n        *   A single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm suggests two equivalent vinylic protons (CH=CH) in a symmetrical molecule. The shift is in the alkene/aromatic region.\n        *   Two ¹³C NMR peaks suggest only two types of carbons. A symmetrical structure would have two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and two equivalent vinylic carbons (C=CH). The chemical shifts of 137 ppm (vinylic C) and 165 ppm (anhydride carbonyl C) are highly characteristic.\n        *   The only molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**, formed from the dehydration of *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid).\n        *   The molecular formula for maleic anhydride is **C₄H₂O₃**.\n\n    *   **The Diene**: The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1,3 and methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. The 5th position is a CH₂ group.\n        *   Let's determine its molecular formula. Cyclopentadiene is C₅H₆. We replace the four vinylic hydrogens on C1, C2, C3, and C4 with four methyl groups.\n        *   Formula = C₅H₂(CH₃)₄ = C₅H₂ + C₄H₁₂ = **C₉H₁₄**.\n\n2.  **Verify the Product's Molecular Formula.**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition, a [4+2] reaction. The formula of the product is the sum of the formulas of the reactants.\n    *   Product Formula = C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**.\n    *   This matches the molecular formula given in the problem, confirming our identification of the reactants.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products.**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride will form a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   The reaction yields two products, a major and a minor one. These correspond to the *endo* and *exo* stereoisomers.\n    *   According to the **Alder endo rule**, for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* adduct is the major product. The *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n        *   **Endo adduct (Major Product)**: The bulky part of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is oriented *syn* (on the same side as) the C7-CH₂ bridge. This places the two hydrogens on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) in an *exo* position relative to the bicyclic system.\n        *   **Exo adduct (Minor Product)**: The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side of) the C7-CH₂ bridge. This places the H_anhydride protons in an *endo* position.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Expected NMR Signals.**\n    *   Due to a plane of symmetry in both the *endo* and *exo* products, we expect the following signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n        *   **A 2H singlet for the anhydride protons (H_anhydride)**. These are methine protons (CH) alpha to two carbonyl groups, so they will be significantly deshielded. The value of **~3.5 ppm** is a reasonable estimate.\n        *   **Two 6H singlets for the methyl groups**. There are two bridgehead methyls (on sp³ carbons) and two vinylic methyls (on sp² carbons of the double bond). They are inequivalent. Vinylic methyls are typically downfield from alkyl methyls.\n            *   Vinylic methyls (**Me_vinyl**): **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**.\n            *   Bridgehead methyls (**Me_bridgehead**): **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet)**.\n        *   **Two 1H signals for the C7 bridge protons**. These two protons (H_syn and H_anti) are diastereotopic and will couple to each other, likely forming a pair of doublets (an AB system). A chemical shift of **~1.5 ppm** for one of them is reasonable.\n\n5.  **Use NOESY to Differentiate Isomers.**\n    *   A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two sets of protons are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. We need to find a proton-proton distance that is short in the *endo* adduct but long in the *exo* adduct.\n    *   Let's analyze the spatial relationships for each option based on the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) structures. The key is the position of the H_anhydride protons.\n        *   **Major (*endo*) product**: H_anhydride are in the *exo* position (pointing \"outward\" and away from the C7 bridge).\n        *   **Minor (*exo*) product**: H_anhydride are in the *endo* position (pointing \"inward\" into the molecular cage, toward the C7 bridge).\n\n    *   **Evaluation of the Options:**\n        *   **A) Me_bridgehead (~1.0 ppm) and Me_vinyl (~1.7 ppm):** The distance between these groups is fixed by the rigid bicyclic skeleton and should be very similar in both *endo* and *exo* isomers. This cannot be the distinguishing cross-peak.\n        *   **B) Me_bridgehead (~1.0 ppm) and H_bridge (~1.5 ppm):** The bridgehead methyls are adjacent to the C7 bridge. Their distance to the C7 protons is short and similar in both isomers. Not a distinguishing feature.\n        *   **C) Me_vinyl (~1.7 ppm) and H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm):**\n            *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the H_anhydride protons are in the *exo* position. This points them towards the C5=C6 double bond bridge where the Me_vinyl groups are located. They are relatively close in space. **A NOESY cross-peak is expected.**\n            *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the H_anhydride protons are in the *endo* position, pointing into the cage and away from the Me_vinyl groups. They are far apart. **A NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak.**\n            *   This scenario perfectly matches the experimental observation given in the question.\n        *   **D) H_bridge (~1.5 ppm) and H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm):**\n            *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, H_anhydride are *exo* and thus far from the C7 bridge protons. **No NOE expected.**\n            *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, H_anhydride are *endo* and point directly at the C7 bridge. They are very close to the *syn*-C7 proton. **Strong NOE expected.**\n            *   This is the opposite of the experimental observation.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    The cross-peak that is present in the major product (endo) and absent in the minor product (exo) is between the vinylic methyl protons (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet) and the anhydride methine protons (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic acid to anhydride**: The problem describes the dehydration of a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid to an anhydride. The anhydride's spectral data (1H NMR: 7 ppm singlet; 13C NMR: 137, 165 ppm) are highly characteristic of maleic anhydride.\n        *   Maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid) dehydrates to maleic anhydride.\n        *   **Symmetry**: Maleic anhydride is a symmetrical molecule (C2v). This explains the single peak in the 1H NMR for the two equivalent vinylic protons (Ha=Hb). A chemical shift of ~7 ppm is appropriate for these protons.\n        *   **Symmetry**: It also explains the two peaks in the 13C NMR: one for the two equivalent vinylic carbons (C=C, ~137 ppm) and one for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O, ~165 ppm).\n        *   **Conclusion**: The dienophile in the reaction is maleic anhydride (C4H2O3).\n\n    *   **Diene**: The diene is explicitly named as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n        *   This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 & 3.\n        *   Methyl groups are attached to all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4).\n        *   The remaining carbon of the ring is a CH2 group (at C5).\n        *   The molecular formula is C9H14.\n        *   This diene is locked in a *cisoid* conformation, making it highly reactive in Diels-Alder reactions.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Let's check the molecular formula: C9H14 (diene) + C4H2O3 (dienophile) → C13H16O3. This matches the formula given for the products.\n    *   Like most Diels-Alder reactions, this one can form two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct. The problem states that two products (major and minor) are formed, which corresponds to these two isomers.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and Major/Minor Products:**\n    *   **Endo Rule**: Diels-Alder reactions are often under kinetic control, favoring the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene and the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile.\n    *   **Steric Effects**: However, this rule can be overridden by steric hindrance. In this case, the diene is heavily substituted with four methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C2 and C3 positions will cause a severe steric clash with the approaching maleic anhydride in the *endo* transition state.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The *exo* transition state is much less sterically hindered. Therefore, the *exo* adduct will be the major product, and the *endo* adduct will be the minor product.\n\n4.  **Relate Stereochemistry to NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY detects protons that are close in space (< 5Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n    *   The question states a unique cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor one. This difference must arise from the different 3D structures of the *exo* (major) and *endo* (minor) isomers.\n\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Major Product)**:\n        *   The anhydride ring is oriented *away* from the C=C double bond of the norbornene system (i.e., *syn* to the C7 bridge).\n        *   This places the methine protons on the anhydride ring (let's call them H-5 and H-6) in an *endo* orientation relative to the norbornene skeleton, tucking them under the C=C double bond.\n        *   Therefore, in the *exo* adduct, H-5 and H-6 are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups (at C2 and C3). **An NOE is expected between {H-5, H-6} and {vinylic methyls}.**\n\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Minor Product)**:\n        *   The anhydride ring is oriented *towards* the C=C double bond.\n        *   This places the methine protons H-5 and H-6 in an *exo* orientation, pointing away from the C=C double bond and towards the C7 methylene bridge.\n        *   Therefore, in the *endo* adduct, H-5 and H-6 are far from the vinylic methyls but are close to the C7 bridge protons. An NOE would be expected between {H-5, H-6} and the {C7 protons}.\n\n    *   **The Distinguishing NOE**: The NOE between the anhydride methine protons {H-5, H-6} and the vinylic methyls {Me-2, Me-3} is present in the major (*exo*) product and absent in the minor (*endo*) product. This is the cross-peak described in the question.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Identify the Correct Option:**\n    *   The product molecule is highly symmetrical (possesses a plane of symmetry), simplifying the NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Vinylic methyls {Me-2, Me-3}**: These two equivalent methyl groups are attached to a double bond. Their signal will be a **6H singlet at ~1.6-1.8 ppm**. This matches the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** in the options.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyls {Me-1, Me-4}**: These two equivalent methyl groups are on saturated, bridgehead carbons. They are relatively shielded. Their signal will be a **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Anhydride methine protons {H-5, H-6}**: These two equivalent protons are on carbons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing anhydride group.

    "Here is a detailed reasoning analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The starting material is described as an anhydride formed from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The NMR data for this anhydride are a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This high degree of symmetry (equivalent protons, two types of equivalent carbons) and the characteristic chemical shifts point unambiguously to **maleic anhydride**. Maleic acid is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid, and its dehydration product is maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃).\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene** (C₉H₁₄). It is a cyclic diene locked in the reactive *s-cis* conformation.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition. The molecular formula of the products (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) matches the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃).\n\n**2. Stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\n*   Diels-Alder reactions between cyclic dienes and dienophiles typically produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. This corresponds to the major and minor products mentioned in the question.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** predicts that the *endo* isomer is usually the kinetically favored (major) product.\n*   However, this rule can be overridden by severe **steric hindrance**. In this case, the diene has four bulky methyl groups. During the formation of the *endo* product, the incoming anhydride ring would be sterically crowded by the diene's methyl groups. The transition state for the *exo* product is much less hindered.\n*   Due to this significant steric clash, the normal selectivity is reversed. The **exo adduct is the major product**, and the **endo adduct is the minor product**. This is a well-established exception to the endo rule.\n\n**3. Analysis of Product Structure and NOESY Data**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy):** This 2D NMR technique reveals which protons are close to each other in 3D space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of spatially proximate protons.\n*   **The Key Information:** A cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent (or weak) in the minor product's spectrum. We must find a spatial interaction that is unique to the **exo** adduct (the major product).\n\n*   **Proton Signal Assignments:** Based on typical chemical shifts and the provided options, we can assign the key signals:\n    *   **H_anhydride:** The two equivalent protons on the carbons originating from maleic anhydride. Being alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained ring, they are deshielded. This is the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Me_vinylic:** The two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond of the product. This is the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Me_bridgehead:** The two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. This is the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **H_bridge:** The two diastereotopic protons of the C7-CH₂ bridge. One of them corresponds to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships in the Isomers:**\n    *   **Major (exo) Product:** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same face as) to the C7 bridge. This orients the H_anhydride protons on the *endo* face, tucking them into the \"cage\" of the bicyclic system. This brings them very close to the **Me_vinylic** groups on the C=C double bond. Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between H_anhydride and Me_vinylic is expected.\n    *   **Minor (endo) Product:** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* to the C7 bridge. The H_anhydride protons are on the *exo* face, pointing away from the bicyclic system. They are now far from the **Me_vinylic** groups, and the NOE between them would be absent or weak. (In this isomer, an NOE would be observed between H_anhydride and the C7-bridge protons).\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe observed cross-peak (present in the major product, absent in the minor) must arise from the unique proximity in the major (exo) adduct. This proximity is between the H_anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n*   H_anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   Me_vinylic protons: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\nThis interaction is described by Option D. The overwhelming majority of the candidate answers, despite often having flawed reasoning about the major product being endo, ultimately identify this pair of resonances as the correct answer. The robustness of this conclusion across different lines of reasoning (some correct, some incorrect) points to its reliability.\n\n<<<D>>>"

This anhydride has a very simple NMR spectrum: a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The single ¹H peak at 7 ppm suggests two chemically equivalent protons on a double bond (vinylic protons).

In this isomer, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed bicyclic system. In this case, it's the C=C double bond bridge from the original diene. More simply, the anhydride is \"tucked under\" the diene's original π system.\n    *   The minor product is the more thermodynamically stable *exo* isomer, where the anhydride part is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side).\n    *   Therefore: **Major Product = Endo Adduct**, **Minor Product = Exo Adduct**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and Predict NOESY Cross-Peaks**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially close protons.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n\n    Let's analyze the proton proximities in both isomers:\n    *   **Proton Groups in the Product:**\n        *   **H_fused**: The two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring is fused. These came from the dienophile. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent.\n        *   **Me_vinyl**: The two methyl groups on the double bond (at positions C2 and C3 of the bicyclo[2.2.1] system). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent.\n        *   **Me_bridgehead**: The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent.\n        *   **CH₂_bridge**: The two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic and not equivalent.\n\n    *   **In the Endo (Major) Product:** The anhydride ring is tucked under the C2=C3 double bond. This brings the **H_fused** protons very close to the **Me_vinyl** groups. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them. The H_fused protons are far from the CH₂_bridge protons.\n\n    *   **In the Exo (Minor) Product:** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond and towards the C7 CH₂ bridge. This brings the **H_fused** protons very close to the **CH₂_bridge** protons. An NOE cross-peak is expected between them. The H_fused protons are now far from the Me_vinyl groups.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** The NOE cross-peak between **H_fused** and **Me_vinyl** is unique to the major (*endo*) product, and it will be absent (or very weak) in the minor (*exo*) product. This matches the description in the question.\n\n4.  **Assign NMR Signals and Identify the Correct Option**\n    *   Now we need to assign the proton groups to the chemical shifts and multiplicities given in the options.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**: This corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups on saturated sp³ carbons, which are the **Me_bridgehead** groups.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: This corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups on a C=C double bond, which are the **Me_vinyl** groups. Their shift is downfield from the other methyls due to the double bond's anisotropy.\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This corresponds to the two equivalent **H_fused** protons. They are alpha to two carbonyl groups, which strongly deshields them, justifying the ~3.5 ppm shift. Their equivalence leads to a singlet.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic **CH₂_bridge** protons.\n\n    *   The NOE cross-peak unique to the major product is between **H_fused** and **Me_vinyl**.\n    *   Based on our assignments, this is a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - **This matches our conclusion.**\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) - These are not uniquely close in the endo isomer.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (CH₂_bridge) - These are reasonably close in both isomers.\n        *   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (CH₂_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_fused) - This cross-peak is characteristic of the *minor (exo)* product, not the major one.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the resonances of the vinylic methyl groups and the protons on the fused anhydride ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid.\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent protons in the alkene region. The high chemical shift is due to deshielding by two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon, C=O). The presence of only two peaks confirms a highly symmetrical structure.\n    *   These spectral data perfectly match **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinyl protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, which aligns with the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   **Product Formula:** The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Major vs. Minor Product):**\n    *   The Alder-endo rule generally predicts that the *endo* adduct is the major kinetic product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   However, the diene in this reaction is highly sterically hindered by four methyl groups. In the transition state leading to the *endo* product, the methyl groups on the diene (specifically at the C1 and C4 positions) would severely clash with the anhydride ring of the dienophile.\n    *   To avoid this steric clash, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the *exo* transition state.\n    *   Therefore, in this specific case, the usual outcome is reversed:\n        *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n        *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n**3. Analyze the NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   **NOESY Principle:** Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), even if they are not connected by chemical bonds.\n*   **The Discriminating Cross-Peak:** The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product (*exo* adduct) but absent or weak in the minor product (*endo* adduct). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* structure but far apart in the *endo* structure.\n\n**4. Compare the *Exo* and *Endo* Structures**\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene products.\n*   Let **H_a** be the two equivalent protons originating from maleic anhydride. They are attached to the carbons of the former dienophile double bond.\n*   Let **H_b** be the two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge (the former CH₂ group of the cyclopentadiene).\n\n*   ***Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. This forces the two **H_a** protons into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they point \"up\" towards the C7 bridge. One of the bridge protons, **H_b(syn)**, also points towards the C2=C3 double bond. The proximity between **H_a** and **H_b(syn)** is very short. **A strong NOE is expected between H_a and H_b(syn).**\n\n*   ***Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 bridge. This forces the two **H_a** protons into the *exo* position, where they point \"down\" and away from the C7 bridge. The distance between **H_a** and the **H_b** protons is large. **No significant NOE is expected.**\n\nThis analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation: the cross-peak is present in the major (*exo*) product and absent in the minor (*endo*) product. Thus, the cross-peak connects protons **H_a** and **H_b(syn)**.\n\n**5. Assign NMR Signals to Protons**\n\nNow we match these protons to the signals described in the options.\n\n*   **H_a protons:** These are two equivalent protons on sp³ carbons that are alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained ring. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is very reasonable. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n*   **H_b protons:** These are the two protons on the C7 bridge. They are typically found in the 1-2 ppm range. The question describes one of them (the one giving the NOE) as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This chemical shift is appropriate, and the \"doublet\" description refers to its geminal coupling with the other C7 proton.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak connects the signal for the **H_a** protons (the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) with the signal for the **H_b(syn)** proton (the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm).\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Incorrect: This implies an interaction between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyls, which is not the unique interaction distinguishing the isomers).\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Correct)**\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Incorrect: Interaction between methyl groups, present in both isomers).\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Incorrect: Interaction between bridgehead methyls and a C7 proton, present in both isomers).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its ¹³C spectrum.\n    *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride. Due to the molecule's symmetry (a C₂v symmetry plane), the two alkene protons are chemically equivalent. This would result in a single peak (a singlet) in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is appropriate for vinylic protons attached to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   Similarly, the two alkene carbons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent. This leads to two signals in the ¹³C NMR spectrum. The chemical shift of ~137 ppm is in the alkene region (C=C), and ~165 ppm is in the carbonyl region (C=O).\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction typically produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* product and the *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product is formed when the dienophile approaches the diene such that its electron-withdrawing groups (the anhydride part) are tucked \"under\" the forming cyclohexene ring, pointing towards the diene's π-system. The endo product is usually the kinetically favored product, meaning it is formed faster and is typically the **major product**.\n    *   The *exo* product is formed when the electron-withdrawing groups point \"away\" from the π-system. The exo product is usually more thermodynamically stable but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n*   The products are bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivatives. The major product is the *endo* adduct, and the minor product is the *exo* adduct. The molecular formula of the products is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (from C₉H₁₄ diene + C₄H₂O₃ anhydride), which matches the problem statement.\n\n**3. Analyze the Structure and Predicted NMR Signals of the Products**\n\nLet's visualize the structure of the product, 1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n\nThere are four distinct sets of protons that will appear as singlets due to the molecule's symmetry:\n*   **Anhydride Protons (Ha):** The two protons on the carbons originating from maleic anhydride (C2 and C3). They are equivalent. These are methine protons adjacent to carbonyl groups. Expected chemical shift: ~3-4 ppm. The problem provides a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Vinylic Methyl Protons (Hb):** The two methyl groups attached to the double bond (at C5 and C6). They are equivalent. Expected chemical shift for vinylic methyls: ~1.5-2.0 ppm. The problem provides a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (Hd):** The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). They are equivalent. Expected chemical shift for saturated methyl groups on a quaternary carbon: ~1.0-1.5 ppm. The problem provides a **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n*   **Bridge Methylene Protons (Hc):** The two protons of the CH₂ bridge at C7. These are not relevant to the options involving only singlets.\n\n**4. Use NOESY Spectroscopy to Differentiate the Products**\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak appears between the signals of two protons if they are spatially close.\n\nThe problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons whose spatial distance changes significantly between the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n*   **In the Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride ring is *syn* (on the same face) to the C5=C6 double bond. This means the anhydride protons (**Ha**, ~3.5 ppm) are located on the same side of the molecule as the vinylic methyl groups (**Hb**, ~1.7 ppm). They are close in space. **Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between Ha and Hb is expected.**\n\n*   **In the Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite face) to the C5=C6 double bond. This means the anhydride protons (**Ha**, ~3.5 ppm) are far away from the vinylic methyl groups (**Hb**, ~1.7 ppm). **Therefore, the NOE cross-peak between Ha and Hb should be absent or very weak.**\n\nThis exactly matches the description in the problem. The cross-peak that differentiates the major and minor products is the one connecting the anhydride protons (Ha) and the vinylic methyl protons (Hb).\n\n**5. Match the Analysis to the Options**\n\n*   The cross-peak connects the resonance for the anhydride protons (**Ha**: 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and the resonance for the vinylic methyl protons (**Hb**: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm).\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect signal description.\n*   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect signal description.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This matches our identified protons Hb and Ha.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This corresponds to the bridgehead methyls (Hd) and vinylic methyls (Hb). While an NOE might exist, it wouldn't be the key differentiating peak as their relative distance doesn't change as dramatically as the Ha-Hb distance between the two isomers.\n\nThus, the cross-peak present in the major product's spectrum connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which upon dehydration forms an anhydride. This is the classic reaction of maleic acid to form maleic anhydride.\n    *   Maleic acid: *cis*-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH\n    *   Dehydration (-H₂O) → Maleic anhydride: A five-membered ring containing O-C(=O)-CH=CH-C(=O)-.\n*   **NMR Data of the Anhydride:**\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This corresponds to the two chemically equivalent vinylic protons (CH=CH), confirming the symmetry of maleic anhydride.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks. One for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) at ~165 ppm and one for the two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C) at ~137 ppm. This confirms the structure is maleic anhydride.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a substituted diene. The cyclopentadiene ring has methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. The C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n**2. Predict the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction produces a bicyclic adduct. Because the dienophile (maleic anhydride) can approach the plane of the diene from two different faces, two stereoisomeric products can be formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   **The Endo Rule:** For Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the major product because it is formed faster (kinetically favored). The *exo* product is the minor product.\n*   **Structure of the Products:** The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride portion of the molecule is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C=C double bond bridge of the bicycloheptene system.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride portion is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C=C double bond bridge.\n\n**3. Analyze the Expected ¹H NMR Spectra of the Products**\n\n*   Both the *endo* and *exo* products possess a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=C bond and the ether oxygen of the anhydride. This simplifies the NMR spectra.\n*   We can identify four main types of protons in the products:\n    1.  **Alpha-protons (Hα):** The two protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. Based on their chemical environment (alpha to a carbonyl, in a strained ring), a chemical shift around **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable.\n    2.  **Vinylic Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. They are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Methyl groups on a double bond typically resonate around **~1.7 ppm**.\n    3.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups attached to the bridgehead carbons (the carbons where the rings are fused). They are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. These are on sp³ carbons and should be more shielded (at a lower ppm) than the vinylic methyls, likely around **~1.0 ppm**.\n    4.  **Bridge Methylene Protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ group that forms the one-carbon bridge. These two protons are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic) and would typically give rise to two separate signals, each coupled to the other. The question mentions a \"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\", which likely corresponds to one of these protons.\n\n**4. Use NOESY Data to Distinguish Between Major and Minor Products**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are bonded.\n*   The question states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**. We need to find a pair of protons whose spatial proximity is significantly different in the *endo* vs. the *exo* isomer.\n*   **In the *endo* isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is folded *under* the C=C bridge. This brings the alpha-protons (Hα, ~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) which are part of that C=C bridge. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between these two groups.\n*   **In the *exo* isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring is folded *away* from the C=C bridge. The alpha-protons (Hα) and the vinylic methyl groups are now far apart. Therefore, the NOE cross-peak between them would be absent or very weak.\n\n**5. Match the Finding with the Given Options**\n\n*   The key differentiating NOE interaction connects the alpha-protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n*   Alpha-protons signal: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   Vinylic methyl protons signal: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n*   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the resonances at ~1.7 ppm and ~3.5 ppm.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This is an interaction between a bridge proton and the alpha-protons. This interaction likely exists in both isomers, although the specific protons involved might differ. It's not the clearest differentiating peak.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: This is between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. They are too far apart for a significant NOE in either isomer.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This corresponds to the interaction between the vinylic methyl protons and the alpha-protons. As determined above, this interaction is strong in the *endo* (major) product and weak/absent in the *exo* (minor) product. This is the correct answer.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: This is between the bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton. They are relatively close in both isomers, so an NOE would be expected in both.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   The first reactant is a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which is dehydrated to an anhydride. This is the classic preparation of maleic anhydride from maleic acid. The 1H NMR (one peak at 7 ppm for two equivalent vinyl protons) and 13C NMR (two peaks for two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons) confirm the symmetric structure of **maleic anhydride**. This is our dienophile.\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is our diene.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring, resulting in a bicyclic adduct.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** Generally, the *endo* product is the kinetically favored (major) product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance Exception:** However, in this specific case, the diene has four bulky methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene sterically hinder the approach of the anhydride in the *endo* orientation. This steric clash is so significant that it overrides the electronic preference for the *endo* product. Therefore, the **exo adduct is the major product**, and the *endo* adduct is the minor product. This is a well-known exception to the endo rule.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures for NOESY Correlations:**\n    *   The NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two protons that are spatially close.\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* adduct (major) but far apart in the *endo* adduct (minor).\n\n    *   Let's visualize the key protons in both isomers:\n        *   **Hb:** The two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule.\n        *   **Me-A:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (vinylic methyls).\n        *   **Me-B:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons.\n\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the newly formed C=C double bond bridge. This geometry brings the anhydride protons (**Hb**) close to the vinylic methyl groups (**Me-A**). Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between Hb and Me-A is expected.\n\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the C=C double bond bridge. This geometry places the anhydride protons (**Hb**) far away from the vinylic methyl groups (**Me-A**). No significant NOE cross-peak between Hb and Me-A is expected.\n\n    *   This perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem. The cross-peak that distinguishes the major product from the minor product is the one between **Hb** and **Me-A**.\n\n5.  **Assign the 1H NMR Signals:**\n    *   We need to match the proton types (Hb and Me-A) to the signals given in the options. Based on typical chemical shifts:\n        *   **Hb:** These are two equivalent protons on sp3-hybridized carbons that are alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained bicyclic system. Their signal will be a **2H singlet** (due to a plane of symmetry) at a relatively downfield position, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Me-A:** These are six protons from two equivalent methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinylic methyls). Their signal will be a **6H singlet** at around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Me-B:** These are six protons from two equivalent methyl groups on saturated bridgehead carbons. They would be the most upfield signal, a **6H singlet** at **~1 ppm**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The distinguishing NOESY cross-peak in the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons (Hb) and the vinylic methyl groups (Me-A).\n    *   This corresponds to the connection between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\nLet's verify this against the given options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me-B) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (part of CH2 bridge).\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me-B) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me-A).\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me-A) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Hb).\n*   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (part of CH2 bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Hb).\n\nOur analysis points directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a highly symmetric structure, as indicated by its NMR spectra:\n        *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This corresponds to two chemically equivalent vinylic protons.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons, C=O).\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**, which is formed from the dehydration of *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). The two vinylic protons are equivalent, as are the two vinylic carbons and the two carbonyl carbons. Maleic anhydride will act as the dienophile in the subsequent reaction.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. Its structure is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, each bearing a methyl group. The 5th position is a CH₂ group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. Specifically, it creates a **bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene** core structure.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants:\n        *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). This matches the formula given in the problem.\n\n3.  **Identify the Products and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the ***endo*** and ***exo*** products.\n    *   According to the **Alder endo rule**, the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored product and therefore the **major product**. The *exo* product is the thermodynamically more stable but kinetically disfavored product, making it the **minor product**.\n    *   Let's visualize the difference:\n        *   ***Endo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the one-carbon bridge (the CH₂ group at C7). The two protons on the carbons where the anhydride is fused (let's call them H_α at C2 and C3) are positioned under the C5=C6 double bond.\n        *   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 CH₂ bridge. The H_α protons point away from the C5=C6 double bond.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NMR Spectra and the NOESY Cross-Peak:**\n    *   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected by chemical bonds.\n    *   The question states that a particular cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent or weak in the minor product**. This means we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product has a plane of symmetry, making pairs of groups chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Vinylic methyl groups:** Two methyl groups on the C5=C6 double bond. They are equivalent. This should be a 6H singlet. Their chemical shift would be around **~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** Two methyl groups on the C1 and C4 bridgehead carbons. They are equivalent. This should be a 6H singlet. Their chemical shift would be in the typical alkyl region, around **~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Anhydride methine protons (H_α):** The two protons at the ring junction (C2, C3). They are equivalent and are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups of the anhydride, so they will be significantly deshielded. This should be a 2H singlet at a higher chemical shift, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridge methylene protons:** The two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic (one *syn*, one *anti* to the double bond) and would likely appear as two separate signals (e.g., two 1H doublets due to geminal coupling). Their chemical shift would be around **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n6.  **Relate NOESY Data to Structure:**\n    *   Let's examine the key distances in the two isomers:\n        *   **In the *endo* (major) product:** The anhydride methine protons (H_α at ~3.5 ppm) are located directly under the double bond. This brings them very **close** to the **vinylic methyl groups** (~1.7 ppm). A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n        *   **In the *exo* (minor) product:** The anhydride methine protons (H_α at ~3.5 ppm) are pointed away from the double bond. They are **far** from the **vinylic methyl groups** (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, the corresponding NOE cross-peak would be absent or very weak. Conversely, these protons would be close to the C7 bridge protons (~1.5 ppm).\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product must be the one connecting the anhydride methine protons and the vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   Based on our assignments, this is the cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\n8.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> Interaction strong in *minor* product.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm -> Interaction present in both products.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm -> Interaction present in both products.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> Interaction strong in *major* product. This matches our analysis.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's spectral data are key:\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent and are in a vinylic or aromatic environment.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene/aromatic region) and 165 ppm (carbonyl region).\n        *   The only simple structure that fits this data is **maleic anhydride**. It has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. This results in one ¹H signal and two ¹³C signals, with chemical shifts matching the data provided. Maleic anhydride is a classic dienophile for the Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The second reactant is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic, conjugated diene, perfect for a Diels-Alder reaction. The structure is a five-membered ring with a CH₂ group at position 5 and methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition**.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   According to the Alder endo rule, the *endo* adduct is typically the major product, formed via a transition state with stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. The *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Anhydride C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃), which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Structures and NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene core structure.\n        *   Methyl groups are at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and the vinylic positions (C2, C3).\n        *   The anhydride ring is fused to the C5-C6 bridge.\n        *   The C7 position is a CH₂ bridge.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry (a plane bisecting the C2=C3 and C5-C6 bonds), we can predict the ¹H NMR signals:\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls (on C1, C4):** These two methyl groups are equivalent. They are attached to saturated, quaternary carbons. They will appear as a **6H singlet** at a relatively low chemical shift, around **~1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyls (on C2, C3):** These two methyl groups are also equivalent. They are attached to a double bond. They will appear as a **6H singlet** at a higher shift than the bridgehead methyls, typically **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride Protons (on C5, C6):** These two methine protons are equivalent. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups. They will appear as a **2H singlet** at a significantly higher shift, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Methylene Bridge Protons (on C7):** These two protons are diastereotopic and would likely form a complex pattern (an AB quartet), not a simple singlet.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Data:**\n    *   NOESY shows through-space correlations between protons that are close to each other (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** and **absent in the minor product**. This means we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Let's analyze the stereochemistry:\n        *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) to the C7 methylene bridge. In this arrangement, the protons on the anhydride bridge (H5, H6) are in the *exo* position (pointing away from the C7 bridge). The vinylic methyl groups (on C2, C3) are also on the \"top\" or *exo* face of the bicyclic system. Because the *exo*-protons (H5, H6) and the vinylic methyls are on the same face of the molecule, they are spatially close. **A NOE cross-peak is expected.**\n        *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. In this case, the protons on the anhydride bridge (H5, H6) are in the *endo* position (pointing towards the C7 bridge). The vinylic methyls remain on the *exo* face. Now, the anhydride protons (*endo*) and the vinylic methyls (*exo*) are on opposite faces of the molecule and are far apart. **No significant NOE is expected.**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The NOE cross-peak observed only in the major product connects the vinylic methyl protons and the anhydride methine protons.\n    *   Matching this to our signal assignments:\n        *   Vinylic methyls: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n        *   Anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid (HOOC-CH=CH-COOH).\n    *   Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride.\n    *   Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinyl protons (-CH=CH-) chemically equivalent. Their chemical shift is typically around 7 ppm, which matches the description.\n    *   Maleic anhydride has two types of carbon atoms: two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and two equivalent vinyl carbons (-CH=CH-). This leads to two signals in the ¹³C NMR spectrum. The carbonyl carbons appear around 165 ppm, and the vinyl carbons around 137 ppm. This perfectly matches the provided data.\n    *   Therefore, the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a conjugated diene, suitable for a Diels-Alder reaction. Its structure is a five-membered ring with a CH₂ group at position 5, double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4, and methyl groups attached to C1, C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   **The Products:** This reaction typically produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed. In Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is usually the kinetically favored (major) product, while the *exo* product is the thermodynamically favored (minor) product.\n*   **Molecular Formula Check:** The diene (C₉H₁₄) reacts with the anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) to form an adduct with the formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the molecular formula given in the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Structures of the Major and Minor Products**\n\nThe key difference between the *endo* and *exo* products lies in the relative stereochemistry of the fused anhydride ring. We need to determine which protons are close in space in one isomer but far apart in the other.\n\n*   **Standard Convention for Cyclopentadiene Adducts:**\n    *   ***Endo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the one-carbon bridge (the CH₂ group, C7 in bicyclic numbering). This orientation places the anhydride ring \"under\" the C2=C3 double bond of the original diene system. This allows for stabilizing secondary orbital interactions, making it the kinetic product.\n    *   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the CH₂ bridge. This is sterically less hindered and thus more thermodynamically stable.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the NOESY NMR Data**\n\n*   **NOESY Principle:** 2D NOESY NMR spectroscopy shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity.\n*   **The Differentiating Cross-Peak:** The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximity Analysis:**\n    *   In the ***endo* (major) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the molecule. This brings the two protons on the anhydride moiety (let's call them H_a) into close proximity with the two methyl groups on the C=C double bond (let's call them Me_vinyl).\n    *   In the ***exo* (minor) product**, the anhydride ring is flipped up. The H_a protons are now far away from the Me_vinyl groups. Instead, they are closer to the CH₂ bridge protons.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major product must be between the anhydride protons (H_a) and the vinyl methyl protons (Me_vinyl).\n\n**Step 5: Assign NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option**\n\nNow, we need to assign the expected ¹H NMR signals to these groups and match them to the given options. The product has a high degree of symmetry (a C_s plane).\n\n*   **Anhydride Protons (H_a):** There are two of them. They are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing anhydride group.\n    *   **Integral:** 2H\n    *   **Multiplicity:** Singlet (any long-range coupling is likely unresolved).\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Typically ~3.5 ppm.\n\n*   **Vinyl Methyl Protons (Me_vinyl):** There are two methyl groups on the double bond. They are equivalent by symmetry.\n    *   **Integral:** 6H (2 x CH₃)\n    *   **Multiplicity:** Singlet.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** For methyl groups on a double bond, typically ~1.7 ppm.\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak connects these two signals. We are looking for an option that describes a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n*   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect integral (1H).\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect integral (1H).\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** - This perfectly matches our prediction for the vinyl methyl protons (6H, ~1.7 ppm) and the anhydride protons (2H, ~3.5 ppm).\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be an interaction between the two different sets of methyl groups (vinyl and bridgehead). The relative orientation of these groups is the same in both the *endo* and *exo* isomers, so this cross-peak would be present in both spectra, not just the major product's.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak unique to the major product connects the resonances described in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates that all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. A peak around 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, and a peak around 137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon.\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid). Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's check if maleic anhydride fits the NMR data. Maleic anhydride is a planar, five-membered ring with a C=C double bond and two C=O groups. It possesses a high degree of symmetry. The two alkene protons are equivalent, and the two alkene carbons are equivalent. The two carbonyl carbons are also equivalent. This would lead to one ¹H signal and two ¹³C signals, which matches the data provided. The chemical shifts (¹H at 7 ppm, ¹³C at 137 ppm for C=C and 165 ppm for C=O) are also fully consistent with the structure of maleic anhydride.\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile in the reaction is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated system.\n\n**Step 2: The Reaction and Its Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n*   When a cyclic diene like cyclopentadiene reacts, two stereoisomeric products can be formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   According to the **Alder endo rule**, the kinetically controlled product, which is typically the major product, is the *endo* adduct. In the *endo* adduct, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the bicyclic system (in this case, the C=C bond from the diene). A more intuitive way for cyclopentadiene adducts is that the dienophile substituents are on the same side as the C7 methylene bridge.\n*   Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* adduct** and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Structure and NMR of the Products for NOESY**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of J-coupling.\n*   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to identify a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   **Proton Assignments in the Product:**\n    1.  **H_anhydride**: The two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring is fused (let's call them C5 and C6). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent and deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls. They correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    2.  **Me_vinylic**: The two methyl groups on the double bond (C2, C3). They are equivalent due to symmetry. Their chemical shift is typical for vinylic methyls. They correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    3.  **Me_bridgehead**: The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). They are equivalent due to symmetry and are in an allylic/aliphatic environment. They correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n    4.  **C7-H**: The two protons on the methylene bridge (C7). They are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They are coupled to each other, so they should appear as a pair of doublets (an AB quartet). The problem mentions a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, which must be one of these two protons.\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships (Proximity):**\n    *   ***Endo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons (at ~3.5 ppm) are pointing into the bicyclic \"cage\". This brings them close to:\n        *   The **C7-H** protons (e.g., the one at ~1.5 ppm).\n        *   The **Me_vinylic** groups (~1.7 ppm), which are located at the other end of the cage.\n    *   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons now point away from the cage. This makes them:\n        *   **Far** from the C7-H protons.\n        *   **Far** from the Me_vinylic groups.\n        *   **Close** to the Me_bridgehead groups (~1.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Identifying the Differentiating Cross-Peak:**\n    The cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product must arise from a proximity that exists only in the *endo* isomer. Based on our analysis, two such proximities exist:\n    1.  **H_anhydride** (~3.5 ppm) <=> **C7-H** (~1.5 ppm) -> This corresponds to **Option A**.\n    2.  **H_anhydride** (~3.5 ppm) <=> **Me_vinylic** (~1.7 ppm) -> This corresponds to **Option D**.\n\n*   **Choosing Between Option A and Option D:**\n    Both describe valid NOEs that confirm the *endo* structure. However, we must choose the best answer. Let's consider the expected intensity of the NOE cross-peak. The intensity of a cross-peak in a NOESY spectrum is related (among other things) to the number of protons giving rise to the signals.\n    *   Option A involves an interaction between a 2H singlet and a 1H doublet.\n    *   Option D involves an interaction between a 2H singlet and a 6H singlet.\n    *   The interaction between the 2H and 6H groups involves a much larger number of protons than the interaction between the 2H and 1H groups. For a similar distance, this will result in a significantly more intense and easily observable cross-peak.\n    *   Furthermore, the NOE between the anhydride protons and the vinylic substituents is the classic, textbook example used to assign *endo* stereochemistry in Diels-Alder adducts of cyclopentadiene.\n\n    Therefore, the most prominent and characteristic cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product is the one between the vinylic methyl groups and the anhydride protons.\n\nFinal Answer Selection: The cross-peak connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinylic) and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride). This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1.

In Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the kinetic product and thus the **major product**, while the *exo* product is the thermodynamic product and typically the **minor product**.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n    *   The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative: **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry and Structure of the Products**\n\n*   Let's define the stereochemistry for this system. The *endo* adduct is the one where the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) of the bicyclic system as the methylene bridge (C7). In this conformation, the two protons on the anhydride part (Hₐ) are pointing towards the C=C double bond.\n*   The *exo* adduct is the one where the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the bicyclic system from the methylene bridge (C7). In this conformation, the two protons on the anhydride part (Hₐ) are pointing away from the C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** The protons Hₐ are directed towards the C=C bond, which bears the vinylic methyl groups (Meᵥ).\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** The protons Hₐ are directed away from the C=C bond and the vinylic methyl groups (Meᵥ).\n\n**4. Analyze the NMR Spectra and the NOESY Cross-Peak**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy):** This technique reveals which protons are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals means the corresponding protons are in close proximity.\n*   **The Key Information:** A cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n*   Based on our structural analysis in Step 3, the distance between the anhydride protons (Hₐ) and the vinylic methyl groups (Meᵥ) is short in the *endo* (major) product and long in the *exo* (minor) product. Therefore, the unique cross-peak in the major product's spectrum must be between **Hₐ** and **Meᵥ**.\n\n**5. Assign the NMR Signals**\n\nNow we need to assign the signals described in the options to the specific protons in the molecule. Both isomers have a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Signal Types and Integrals:**\n    *   **Vinylic Methyls (Meᵥ):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond. Signal: **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls (Me_bh):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. Signal: **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (Hₐ):** Two equivalent protons where the anhydride ring is fused. Signal: **2H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridge Protons (H_b):** Two diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ bridge. They would likely give two 1H signals, coupled to each other (e.g., two doublets or an AB quartet). The \"1H doublet\" in the options likely refers to one of these.\n\n*   **Chemical Shift (δ) Assignment:**\n    *   Vinylic methyls are deshielded compared to saturated alkyl methyls. A reasonable shift is **~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   Bridgehead methyls are on saturated carbons. A reasonable shift is **~1 ppm**.\n    *   Anhydride protons (Hₐ) are α to carbonyl groups in a strained ring. They will be significantly deshielded. A reasonable shift is **~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   Bridge protons (H_b) are in a saturated, bicyclic environment. A reasonable shift is **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\n*   The NOESY cross-peak unique to the major product connects the vinylic methyl protons (Meᵥ) and the anhydride protons (Hₐ).\n*   Our assignment for these signals is:\n    *   **Meᵥ:** 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   **Hₐ:** 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n*   This corresponds to the pair of resonances described in option D.\n\nLet's check the other options:\n*   A) Me_bh (~1 ppm) and H_b (~1.5 ppm): This distance should be similar in both isomers.\n*   B) H_b (~1.5 ppm) and Hₐ (~3.5 ppm): The distance between these depends on which bridge proton (syn or anti) and which isomer (endo or exo) is considered. It's not as clear-cut as the Hₐ-Meᵥ interaction for differentiating the isomers.\n*   C) Me_bh (~1 ppm) and Meᵥ (~1.7 ppm): These are on adjacent carbons, and their distance should be short and similar in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly identifies a pair of protons that are close in the major (*endo*) isomer and far in the minor (*exo*) isomer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **The Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in its ¹³C NMR.\n        *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃). Due to its C₂ᵥ symmetry, the two protons on the double bond are equivalent, leading to a single peak in the ¹H NMR. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of olefinic protons deshielded by two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n        *   Similarly, there are only two types of carbon atoms: the two equivalent olefinic carbons and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons. This leads to two peaks in the ¹³C NMR. The chemical shifts of ~137 ppm (olefinic C=C) and ~165 ppm (carbonyl C=O) are consistent with this structure.\n        *   Therefore, the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n    *   **The Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a conjugated diene with the formula C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct. The reaction yields two diastereomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n    *   The molecular formula of the products will be the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n\n3.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction typically follows the \"endo rule,\" where the major product is the *endo* adduct due to favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   However, the endo rule can be overridden by significant steric hindrance. In this case, the diene has four methyl groups, including two at the reacting carbons (C1 and C4). In the *endo* transition state, the anhydride molecule tucks \"under\" the diene, leading to a significant steric clash with the methyl groups at C1 and C4. The *exo* transition state, where the anhydride is further away from these methyl groups, is less sterically hindered.\n    *   Therefore, for this specific reaction, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *endo* adduct**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures and NOESY Spectra**\n    *   **NOESY** (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the major (*exo*) product but far apart in the minor (*endo*) product.\n    *   Let's analyze the proton signals and their positions in the two isomers. The products have a plane of symmetry, leading to four main types of proton signals in the ¹H NMR:\n        *   **H_alpha (2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm):** The two protons on the anhydride part of the molecule.\n        *   **Me_vinyl (6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm):** The two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Me_bridgehead (6H singlet, ~1.0 ppm):** The two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons.\n        *   **H_bridge (2H, complex signal):** The two diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ bridge (not relevant for the options provided).\n\n    *   **Structure of the Major (*exo*) Product:**\n        *   In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (away from) the CH₂ bridge. This orients the **H_alpha** protons towards the C=C double bond.\n        *   This geometry brings the **H_alpha** protons very close to the **Me_vinyl** groups.\n        *   Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between **H_alpha** and **Me_vinyl**.\n\n    *   **Structure of the Minor (*endo*) Product:**\n        *   In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) the CH₂ bridge. This orients the **H_alpha** protons away from the C=C double bond.\n        *   In this geometry, the **H_alpha** protons and the **Me_vinyl** groups are far apart.\n        *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak between **H_alpha** and **Me_vinyl** will be absent or very weak.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product.\n    *   Our analysis shows that the cross-peak between **H_alpha** (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) and **Me_vinyl** (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet) fits this description perfectly.\n    *   This corresponds to the pair of resonances described in option A.\n\nFinal Answer Selection:\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_alpha)**: This matches our conclusion.\n*   B), C), D): These describe interactions that are either weak, absent, or not unique to the major product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes the dehydration of a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid to an anhydride.\n        *   ¹H NMR of the anhydride: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent vinylic protons (a chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons deshielded by adjacent carbonyl groups).\n        *   ¹³C NMR of the anhydride: Two peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).\n        *   The only structure that fits this data is **maleic anhydride**, which is formed from *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). It is a planar molecule with a C₂v symmetry axis, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two vinylic carbons equivalent, as well as the two carbonyl carbons equivalent.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, each bearing a methyl group, and a CH₂ group at position 5.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**\n    *   The reaction between the anhydride (dienophile) and the diene is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The product's molecular formula is C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₄H₂O₃ for maleic anhydride and C₉H₁₄ for the diene).\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **endo rule** predicts that the major product is typically the *endo* adduct, due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by significant steric hindrance. The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, has bulky methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions, which are involved in the new bond formation. These methyl groups sterically hinder the *endo* approach of the dienophile.\n    *   Therefore, in this specific case, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *endo* adduct**. This is a known exception to the endo rule, confirmed by literature.\n        *   **Major Product = Exo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the *exo* face of the bicyclic system (on the same side as the C7 methylene bridge).\n        *   **Minor Product = Endo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the *endo* face (on the opposite side of the C7 bridge).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Product Structure and Proton NMR Signals**\n    *   The product has a plane of symmetry passing through the C7 bridge and the center of the C=C and anhydride bonds.\n    *   This symmetry makes pairs of protons and methyl groups equivalent. We expect the following signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n        *   **Vinylic Methyls (`Me_alkene`):** Two methyl groups on the C=C double bond (at C2, C3). They are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Chemical shift for vinylic methyls is typically ~1.6-2.0 ppm.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls (`Me_bridgehead`):** Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). They are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Chemical shift for saturated methyls is typically lower, ~1.0-1.5 ppm.\n        *   **Anhydride Protons (`H_anhydride`):** Two protons on the carbons from maleic anhydride (at C5, C6). They are equivalent. Signal: **2H singlet**. Being alpha to carbonyl groups, they are deshielded, with a typical shift of ~3.0-4.0 ppm.\n        *   **Bridge Protons (`H_bridge`):** Two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge. They would likely appear as two separate signals (e.g., two doublets), but are not central to the options provided.\n\n5.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) cross-peak indicates that two sets of protons are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent/weak in the minor product**.\n    *   We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* adduct (major) but far apart in the *endo* adduct (minor).\n\n    *   **In the Exo Adduct (Major Product):**\n        *   The anhydride ring is *exo*. The two `H_anhydride` protons are on the *endo* face. This means they point \"down\" towards the C2=C3 double bond.\n        *   The `Me_alkene` groups are also on the \"bottom\" part of the structure.\n        *   Therefore, the *endo* `H_anhydride` protons are **spatially close** to the `Me_alkene` protons. A strong NOE is expected.\n\n    *   **In the Endo Adduct (Minor Product):**\n        *   The anhydride ring is *endo*. The two `H_anhydride` protons are on the *exo* face. This means they point \"up\" away from the C2=C3 double bond and towards the C7 bridge.\n        *   Therefore, the *exo* `H_anhydride` protons are **spatially far** from the `Me_alkene` protons. The NOE would be absent or very weak.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** The distinguishing cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the `H_anhydride` protons and the `Me_alkene` protons.\n\n6.  **Match with the Given Options**\n    *   We are looking for the signals corresponding to `H_anhydride` and `Me_alkene`.\n    *   `H_anhydride` = 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   `Me_alkene` = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n\n    Let's evaluate the options:\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This perfectly matches the signals for `Me_alkene` and `H_anhydride`, which are the protons that show proximity in the major (*exo*) product.\n    *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This describes an interaction between a bridge proton and the anhydride protons, which is not the key differentiating interaction.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: Describes an interaction between the bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: Describes an interaction between the two different types of methyl groups, which are not uniquely close in the major product.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n        *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically and magnetically equivalent vinylic protons. The chemical shift is downfield due to electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. Maleic acid is *cis*-butenedioic acid, and its dehydration yields the five-membered cyclic anhydride. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent.\n\n    *   **Reactant 2:** **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene. The structure has a five-membered ring with double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4. Methyl groups are attached to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. Carbon 5 is a CH₂ group. The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* product is typically the major product, formed under kinetic control. The *exo* product is the minor product.\n    *   Major product = *endo* adduct.\n    *   Minor product = *exo* adduct.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula of the product: C₄H₂O₃ (maleic anhydride) + C₉H₁₄ (diene) → C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Products and Assign Protons:**\n    Let's draw the product and use standard bicyclic numbering.\n    *   The diene's C1-C4 and the dienophile's two carbons form a new six-membered ring.\n    *   A new C=C double bond is formed between the diene's C2 and C3 positions. These carbons each bear a methyl group.\n    *   The diene's C1 and C4 become the bridgehead carbons. These carbons also each bear a methyl group.\n    *   The diene's C5 (the CH₂ group) becomes the C7 bridge of the bicyclic system.\n    *   The maleic anhydride carbons become C5 and C6, with the anhydride ring fused to the structure. The two protons from the maleic anhydride are on C5 and C6.\n\n    Let's predict the ¹H NMR signals for the product:\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). These are shielded and should appear upfield. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Vinyl Methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the new C=C double bond (C2, C3). These are deshielded compared to the bridgehead methyls. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (Hₐ):** Two equivalent protons on C5 and C6. They are alpha to carbonyl groups, so they are significantly deshielded. The adjacent bridgehead carbons (C1, C4) are quaternary, so these protons will not be split. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridge Protons (C7-H):** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the C=C double bond, one is *anti*). They will couple to each other (geminal coupling) but not to the quaternary bridgehead carbons. They should appear as two doublets. The problem mentions a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, which is one of these protons.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra to Distinguish *Endo* and *Exo* Isomers:**\n    *   **NOESY** (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find a pair of protons that are uniquely close in the *endo* isomer.\n    *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** In the *endo* configuration, the anhydride ring (and its protons, Hₐ) is tucked underneath the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C7 bridge. This brings the anhydride protons (Hₐ on C5/C6) into close proximity with the protons on the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** In the *exo* configuration, the anhydride ring points away from the C7 bridge. The Hₐ protons are now far from the C7 bridge protons.\n\n    Therefore, the NOE cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product is between the **anhydride protons (Hₐ)** and the **C7 bridge protons**.\n\n5.  **Match the Protons to the Resonances in the Options:**\n    *   The anhydride protons (Hₐ) give the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   One of the C7 bridge protons gives the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n    The NOESY cross-peak in the major product will connect these two signals.\n\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 bridge proton). These are not uniquely close in the endo isomer.\n    B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). These would be close in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) product.\n    C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. These are two different methyl groups. An NOE between them would likely exist in both isomers.\n    D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). This matches our analysis perfectly. This spatial proximity is the defining characteristic of the *endo* isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   The first reactant is an anhydride derived from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The NMR data for this anhydride is given: `1H NMR` shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and `13C NMR` shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   Let's analyze the NMR data for the anhydride:\n        *   `1H NMR`: A single peak at 7 ppm indicates two or more protons that are chemically equivalent and are in the vinylic or aromatic region.\n        *   `13C NMR`: Two peaks. The peak at 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O). The peak at 137 ppm is characteristic of a vinylic carbon (C=C).\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride.\n    *   Let's check if maleic anhydride fits the data:\n        *   Structure: A five-membered ring containing O-C(=O)-CH=CH-C(=O)-.\n        *   Symmetry: The molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, as well as the two vinylic carbons equivalent.\n        *   `1H NMR`: One signal for the two equivalent vinylic protons. The chemical shift is indeed around 7.08 ppm.\n        *   `13C NMR`: Two signals. One for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm) and one for the two equivalent vinylic carbons (~135 ppm).\n    *   The data perfectly matches maleic anhydride. So, the first reactant is maleic anhydride (C4H2O3).\n    *   The second reactant is explicitly named: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C9H14).\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride). This is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   The product is a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula is C4H2O3 + C9H14 = C13H16O3, which matches the information provided.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the Alder rule, the *endo* adduct is the kinetic product and is typically the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamic product and is typically the **minor product**.\n    *   Let's establish the structure of these adducts. The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene skeleton.\n        *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite face) to the C7 methylene bridge. This places the two protons on the anhydride-fused carbons (let's call them H-2 and H-3) in the *exo* position (pointing towards the C7 bridge).\n        *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same face) to the C7 methylene bridge. This places H-2 and H-3 in the *endo* position (pointing away from the C7 bridge, towards the C=C double bond).\n\n3.  **Analyze the NMR Spectra of the Products:**\n    *   Due to a plane of symmetry in both the *endo* and *exo* products, the `1H NMR` spectrum is expected to show:\n        *   A 6H singlet for the two equivalent bridgehead methyl groups (on C1 and C4).\n        *   A 6H singlet for the two equivalent vinylic methyl groups (on C5 and C6).\n        *   A 2H singlet for the two equivalent protons H-2 and H-3. A chemical shift of ~3.5 ppm is reasonable for these protons, which are alpha to carbonyl groups.\n        *   Two signals for the two diastereotopic protons of the C7 methylene bridge. These would likely appear as a pair of doublets (an AB quartet). A chemical shift of ~1.5 ppm is reasonable for these aliphatic protons.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Data:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5Å).\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists only in the *endo* adduct.\n    *   Let's analyze the spatial relationships in each isomer:\n        *   **Major Product (Endo adduct):**\n            *   The protons H-2 and H-3 are in the *exo* position.\n            *   In this orientation, the *exo* protons are close to the bridgehead substituents. Here, the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4) have methyl groups. Therefore, an NOE is expected between the H-2/H-3 protons and the bridgehead methyl protons.\n            *   The *exo* H-2/H-3 protons are relatively far from the C7 bridge protons and the vinylic methyl groups.\n        *   **Minor Product (Exo adduct):**\n            *   The protons H-2 and H-3 are in the *endo* position.\n            *   In this orientation, the *endo* protons are far from the bridgehead methyl groups.\n            *   They are, however, close to the vinylic methyl groups (on C5, C6) and the C7 bridge protons.\n\n5.  **Match the Analysis with the Options:**\n    *   The unique NOE in the major product is between the H-2/H-3 protons and the bridgehead methyl protons.\n    *   Let's identify the corresponding signals from the options:\n        *   The H-2/H-3 protons give the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`.\n        *   The bridgehead methyl protons give one of the `6H singlets` (e.g., the one at `~1.7 ppm`).\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` and a `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm`.\n\n    *   This corresponds directly to **Option D**.\n\n    *   Let's quickly check why other options are incorrect:\n        *   A) 6H singlet and 6H singlet: Interaction between the two sets of methyl groups. This interaction would be present in both isomers.\n        *   B) 6H singlet and 1H doublet: Interaction between a methyl group and a C7 proton. This would also likely be present in both isomers to some extent.\n        *   C) 1H doublet and 2H singlet: Interaction between a C7 proton and the H-2/H-3 protons. This interaction is characteristic of the *minor (exo)* product, not the major one.\n\nFinal conclusion is that the cross-peak is between the H-2/H-3 protons and the bridgehead methyl groups, which is described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n\n    *   **Dienophile (from the dicarboxylic acid):** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's spectral data is key:\n        *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift (7 ppm) is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond).\n        *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. A peak around 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), and a peak around 137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon (C=C).\n        *   The simplest structure that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, resulting in the observed simple NMR spectra. The chemical shifts are also consistent with those of maleic anhydride.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4. It has methyl groups on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at C5.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Diels-Alder Reaction and Products**\n\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The product's molecular formula is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (from C₉H₁₄ diene + C₄H₂O₃ anhydride), which matches the information given.\n    *   Like most Diels-Alder reactions, this one can produce two stereoisomeric products: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n        *   The **endo adduct** is generally the major product due to kinetic control arising from favorable secondary orbital interactions. In this product, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the one-carbon bridge (the C7 methylene bridge).\n        *   The **exo adduct** is generally the minor product. In this product, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the one-carbon bridge.\n\n3.  **Relate Structure to the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates a spatial proximity between the corresponding protons.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or very weak) in the minor product. This means we must find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and Proton Proximity**\n\n    *   Let's visualize the structures:\n        *   **Endo Product (Major):** The bicyclic system has a V-shape. In the endo isomer, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the newly formed cyclohexene ring. This places the two protons that came from maleic anhydride (let's call them **H_anhydride**) very close to the methyl groups on the double bond of the bicyclic system (let's call them **Me_vinyl**).\n        *   **Exo Product (Minor):** In the exo isomer, the anhydride ring is flipped away. This moves the **H_anhydride** protons far away from the **Me_vinyl** groups. Instead, they are now closer to the protons on the C7 methylene bridge.\n\n    *   Therefore, the unique NOE interaction in the major (endo) product is between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **Me_vinyl** protons.\n\n5.  **Predict the ¹H NMR Signals for the Interacting Protons**\n\n    *   **H_anhydride:** These two protons are on the carbons adjacent to the anhydride's carbonyl groups. They are chemically equivalent due to a plane of symmetry in the product. They have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they will appear as a **singlet**. Their integral will be **2H**. Being next to electron-withdrawing carbonyls, they will be deshielded, appearing at a chemical shift of approximately **3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Me_vinyl:** These are the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond in the product (originally on C2 and C3 of the diene). They are also equivalent by symmetry. They will appear as a **singlet** with an integral of **6H**. The typical chemical shift for vinylic methyl groups is around **1.7 ppm**.\n\n6.  **Match the Prediction with the Given Options**\n\n    *   We are looking for a NOESY cross-peak connecting a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_anhydride) and a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (Me_vinyl).\n    *   Let's examine the options:\n        *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect signal type/integral (1H doublet).\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect signal type/integral (1H doublet).\n        *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This perfectly matches our prediction.**\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be an interaction between the bridgehead methyls (~1 ppm) and the vinyl methyls (~1.7 ppm). This interaction would exist in both isomers and is not the unique interaction differentiating the major and minor products.\n\nThe cross-peak present in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects the 6H singlet from the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) and the 2H singlet from the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's spectral data is given:\n        *   `1H NMR`: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   `13C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This indicates two types of carbon atoms.\n    *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. Maleic anhydride is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). It has a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent (shift ~7.0 ppm) and the two alkene carbons equivalent (~137 ppm). The two carbonyl carbons are also equivalent (~165 ppm).\n    *   The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a substituted cyclopentadiene, which acts as the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. Its structure is a five-membered ring with a CH₂ group and four methyl groups on the four carbons of the conjugated diene system.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. Specifically, it will form a **bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene** derivative.\n    *   The reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the ***endo*** and ***exo*** products. The problem states that two products are formed (a major and a minor one).\n\n3.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products**\n    *   The **Alder-endo rule** predicts that the *endo* product is typically the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. This places the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) underneath the newly formed cyclohexene ring.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by significant **steric hindrance**. In this case, the diene has four methyl groups. In the *endo* transition state, the incoming anhydride ring would be on the same face as the CH₂ bridge, but it would also be very close to the methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 of the diene (which become the bridgehead positions in the product). This creates substantial steric repulsion.\n    *   The *exo* transition state, where the anhydride ring points away from the diene's methyl groups, is sterically much more favorable.\n    *   Therefore, in this specific reaction, the **exo product is the major product**, and the *endo* product is the minor product.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures of the Products and their Spatial Relationships**\n    *   Let's draw the skeleton of the product, a 1,4,5,6-tetramethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride. This name is complex, let's focus on the key structural features and proton locations for NOESY analysis. The product has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Proton environments:**\n        *   **Me-alkene:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2=C3). Total 6H. Expected shift for vinylic methyls is ~1.7-2.0 ppm.\n        *   **Me-bridgehead:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). Total 6H. Expected shift for alkyl methyls is lower, ~1.0-1.3 ppm.\n        *   **H-anhydride:** Two equivalent protons on the carbons where the anhydride is fused (C5, C6). Total 2H. Expected shift for protons alpha to a carbonyl is ~3-4 ppm.\n        *   **CH₂-bridge:** Two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge. Total 2H.\n    *   **NOESY relies on through-space proximity (< 5 Å).** We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the major product but far in the minor product.\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Major Product):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* to the CH₂ bridge. This places the H-anhydride protons (at C5 and C6) in the *endo* position, meaning they are tucked underneath the C2=C3 double bond. This brings them very close to the **Me-alkene** groups.\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Minor Product):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is *syn* to the CH₂ bridge. This places the H-anhydride protons in the *exo* position, pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond. They are far from the **Me-alkene** groups but are close to the **Me-bridgehead** groups.\n\n5.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum and Assign Resonances**\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present** in the major product's spectrum but absent/weak in the minor product's.\n    *   Based on our analysis, the close proximity between **H-anhydride** and **Me-alkene** is the unique feature of the **exo (major)** product.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in question connects the signals for H-anhydride and Me-alkene.\n    *   Now, we assign the chemical shifts given in the options to our proton types:\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This corresponds to the two equivalent **Me-alkene** groups.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** This corresponds to the two equivalent **Me-bridgehead** groups.\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This corresponds to the two equivalent **H-anhydride** protons.\n        *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is one of the diastereotopic **CH₂-bridge** protons.\n    *   The cross-peak in the major product connects the **Me-alkene** protons and the **H-anhydride** protons.\n    *   This corresponds to the resonances at **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)** and **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)**.\n\n6.  **Select the Correct Answer**\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me-bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me-alkene). These are far apart.\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (CH2 bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H-anhydride). This interaction (between H-anhydride and the bridge) would be strong in the *endo* (minor) product, not the major one.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me-alkene) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H-anhydride). This matches our conclusion perfectly.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me-bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (CH2 bridge). This distance is fixed in the bicyclic frame and should be similar in both isomers.\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene, which dehydrates to an anhydride.\n        *   The anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all its protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   It has two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This indicates two types of carbon atoms.\n        *   The only structure that fits these data is maleic anhydride. It has C₂v symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, and the two alkene carbons equivalent. The chemical shifts are also consistent with this structure.\n        *   Structure of maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃): A five-membered ring with an oxygen atom, two C=O groups, and a C=C double bond (O=C-CH=CH-C=O).\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄). This is a five-membered ring with a CH₂ group at C5 and methyl groups at positions C1, C2, C3, and C4.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the problem statement.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   According to the Alder-Eberius rule (the *endo* rule), the major product of a kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reaction is the *endo* adduct. The minor product is the *exo* adduct.\n    *   The question focuses on the **major product**, which is the **endo adduct**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry and Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the one-carbon bridge (the C7 bridge, which is a CH₂ group). In this conformation, the two protons that originated from the maleic anhydride are tucked underneath the newly formed six-membered ring.\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. The protons from the anhydride point away from the bicyclic system.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY NMR Data:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent or weak in the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   This means we must identify a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n5.  **Assign Proton Signals and Identify the Key NOE:**\n    *   Let's identify the different types of protons in the product and estimate their chemical shifts:\n        *   **H(anhydride):** The two protons from the maleic anhydride moiety. By symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. Being adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring, they will be downfield. A shift of **~3.5 ppm** is a reasonable estimate.\n        *   **Me(vinyl):** The two methyl groups on the C=C double bond of the newly formed ring (at positions C2 and C3). By symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Vinylic methyl groups typically resonate around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Me(bridgehead):** The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). By symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as another **6H singlet**. Tertiary alkyl methyl groups are typically more shielded (upfield), so a shift of **~1.0 ppm** is reasonable.\n        *   **H(bridge):** The two protons on the C7 bridge (the CH₂ group). They are diastereotopic and will appear as two distinct signals, likely coupled to each other (geminal coupling), forming an AB quartet or two doublets. Their shift would be in the aliphatic region, around **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n    *   Now, let's look for protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but not the *exo*:\n        *   In the *endo* structure, the H(anhydride) protons are held under the C2=C3 double bond. This places them very close to the **Me(vinyl)** groups.\n        *   In the *exo* structure, the H(anhydride) protons point away from the C2=C3 double bond, and the distance to the Me(vinyl) groups is much larger.\n        *   Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak between the H(anhydride) protons and the Me(vinyl) protons is expected for the major (*endo*) product, and this peak would be absent or very weak for the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   The key NOE connects the H(anhydride) protons and the Me(vinyl) protons.\n    *   H(anhydride) signal: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   Me(vinyl) signal: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This corresponds exactly to the description in **Option B**.\n\n    *   Let's briefly check the other options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me(bridgehead)) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H(bridge)): These are close in both isomers.\n        *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H(bridge)) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H(anhydride)): This interaction also exists in the *endo* adduct but not the *exo*. However, the interaction described in B is a classic example used to determine *endo* stereochemistry, directly probing the spatial relationship between the original diene and dienophile components.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me(bridgehead)) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me(vinyl)): These are on adjacent carbons and are close in both isomers.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most defining NOE cross-peak that distinguishes the major (*endo*) from the minor (*exo*) product is the one between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride.\n        *   **1H NMR of Anhydride:** A single peak at 7 ppm. This chemical shift is in the vinylic/aromatic region. A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n        *   **13C NMR of Anhydride:** Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). The presence of only two peaks also indicates high molecular symmetry.\n        *   The only common structure that fits this data is **maleic anhydride**, formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinylic protons (giving a singlet at ~7.0 ppm) and two sets of equivalent carbons (two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons), consistent with the NMR data.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The second reactant is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a conjugated diene substituted with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n    *   The molecular formula of the diene is C9H14, and the anhydride is C4H2O3. The adduct's formula is C13H16O3, which matches the problem statement.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two main stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which correspond to these two isomers.\n\n3.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry):**\n    *   The *endo* rule states that the kinetically favored (usually major) product is the one where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are oriented under the newly forming ring (syn to the longer bridge).\n    *   **However, this rule is often reversed by significant steric hindrance.** In this case, the diene has methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). In the *endo* approach, the maleic anhydride moiety would clash sterically with these methyl groups.\n    *   In the *exo* approach, the anhydride is oriented away from these methyl groups, resulting in a much less sterically hindered transition state.\n    *   Therefore, due to overwhelming steric hindrance, the **major product will be the *exo* isomer**, and the **minor product will be the *endo* isomer**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures and Predicted NMR Signals:**\n    *   Let's visualize the two products and identify the key proton groups. Both products are highly symmetrical.\n        *   **H-anhydride:** The two protons on the anhydride part of the skeleton (at positions C2 and C3). They are equivalent due to symmetry in both isomers. They are alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained ring, so a chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable. This would be a **2H singlet**.\n        *   **Me-alkene:** The two methyl groups on the C=C double bond (at C5 and C6). They are equivalent. As vinylic methyl groups, their shift would be around **~1.7 ppm**. This would be a **6H singlet**.\n        *   **Me-bridgehead:** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (at C1 and C4). They are also equivalent. Being on a saturated, quaternary carbon, they would be more shielded, with a shift likely around **~1.0 ppm**. This would be another **6H singlet**.\n        *   (Note: The protons on the C7 bridge are not relevant to the options provided).\n\n5.  **Correlate Structure with NOESY Data:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n    *   The problem states: A cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**.\n    *   Since we determined that **Major = *exo*** and **Minor = *endo***, we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* isomer but far apart in the *endo* isomer.\n\n    *   Let's examine the spatial relationships:\n        *   ***Exo* isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C5=C6 double bond. This brings the **H-anhydride protons** (~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the **Me-alkene groups** (~1.7 ppm). **A strong NOE cross-peak is expected.**\n        *   ***Endo* isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C5=C6 double bond (it is *syn* to the C7 bridge). The H-anhydride protons and the Me-alkene groups are far apart. **No significant NOE is expected.**\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The observed NOE cross-peak, which is present only in the major product, must connect the H-anhydride protons and the Me-alkene protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignments, these correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a very simple NMR spectrum:\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent protons on a double bond. The downfield shift to 7 ppm is characteristic of vinyl protons attached to electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).\n    *   These data perfectly match the structure of **maleic anhydride**. It is symmetrical, so the two vinyl protons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, as are the two vinyl carbons.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a new six-membered ring, resulting in a bicyclic adduct.\n\n**3. Address the Molecular Formula Discrepancy**\n\n*   Let's calculate the molecular formula of the expected Diels-Alder product:\n    *   Maleic anhydride: C₄H₂O₃\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene: C₉H₁₂\n    *   Diels-Alder Adduct: C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₂ = **C₁₃H₁₄O₃**\n*   The problem states the products have a molecular formula of **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This differs by two hydrogen atoms (H₂), suggesting a reduction (hydrogenation) of a double bond might have occurred after the Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   However, let's analyze the consequences. If the product were reduced, the characteristic NOE pattern that distinguishes *endo* and *exo* Diels-Alder products would be altered in a way that contradicts the problem statement (this will be shown below). It is most likely that the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ is a typo in the question and we should proceed by analyzing the direct Diels-Alder adducts (C₁₃H₁₄O₃), as this leads to a logical and consistent answer.\n\n**4. Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   **Endo Rule:** In most Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is formed faster and is the **major product** (kinetic control). The *exo* product is usually more stable but forms slower, making it the **minor product**.\n    *   **Endo Adduct:** The electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride part) is oriented \"under\" the π-system of the newly formed ring (originally the diene).\n    *   **Exo Adduct:** The anhydride part is oriented \"away\" from the π-system.\n\n*   Let's visualize the structures:\n    *   **Major Product (Endo):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C=C bridge that bears the four methyl groups. The two protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) are spatially close to the methyl groups on the double bond (let's call them Me_vinyl).\n    *   **Minor Product (Exo):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C=C bridge. The H_anhydride protons are far from the Me_vinyl groups.\n\n**5. Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\"\n*   Based on our structural analysis:\n    *   In the **major (endo) product**, the H_anhydride protons and the Me_vinyl groups are close. A NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n    *   In the **minor (exo) product**, these protons are far apart. No significant NOESY cross-peak is expected.\n*   This perfectly matches the experimental observation. Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product is between the H_anhydride protons and the Me_vinyl protons.\n\n**6. Assign the NMR Resonances**\n\n*   We now need to assign the signals described in the answer choices to the protons in our structure.\n    *   **H_anhydride:** These are two equivalent protons (due to symmetry) on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. They are deshielded and should appear as a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Me_vinyl:** These are four methyl groups attached to the double bond. By symmetry, they fall into two sets of two. However, in many similar systems, the difference is small, and they might appear as a single peak. The question describes them as singlets. Let's look closer: there are two methyls on the \"front\" of the double bond (e.g., C1, C4) and two on the \"back\" (C2, C3 of the original diene). The adduct has C2v symmetry. The methyls at C1 and C4 of the diene become the bridgehead methyls. The methyls at C2 and C3 of the diene remain on the double bond of the product. The problem simplifies this by referring to the signals for the products. Let's re-examine the diene: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The product is 1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n        *   The methyls at positions 1 and 4 are bridgehead methyls. They are on saturated carbons. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**. They should be a **6H singlet at ~1.0-1.5 ppm**.\n        *   The methyls at positions 5 and 6 are on the double bond. Let's call them **Me_vinyl**. They are deshielded relative to the bridgehead methyls. They should be a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   The key NOE is between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl.\n*   The corresponding signals are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\n**7. Match with the Options**\n\n*   Let's review the options based on our assignments:\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl)\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride)\n    *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (likely a bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride)\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (likely a bridge proton)\n\nOur analysis shows the cross-peak connects the resonances for Me_vinyl and H_anhydride. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\ntrl95>He\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride:** The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. Upon dehydration, it forms an anhydride with a very simple NMR spectrum:\n    *   ¹H NMR: one singlet at 7.0 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent and are in the vinylic region.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons, C=O).\n    *   The only molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry that makes the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, resulting in the simple spectra described.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene (C₉H₁₄) that is substituted with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product would be the sum of the reactants: C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product. According to the Alder rule, the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored product and is therefore the **major product**. The *exo* product is the thermodynamically favored but kinetically slower-forming product, making it the **minor product**.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Major and Minor Products**\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products. The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n\n*   **Common features of both isomers:**\n    *   A C=C double bond with two methyl groups attached (from C2 and C3 of the diene). Let's call these **vinylic methyls**.\n    *   Two bridgehead carbons, each with a methyl group attached (from C1 and C4 of the diene). Let's call these **bridgehead methyls**.\n    *   A fused anhydride ring (from maleic anhydride). The two protons on the carbons where the ring is fused originate from the maleic anhydride. Let's call these **anhydride protons**.\n    *   A one-carbon bridge (a CH₂ group from C5 of the diene).\n\n*   **Key stereochemical difference:**\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C=C double bond bridge. The anhydride protons point \"under\" the C=C bridge.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C=C double bond bridge.\n\nBoth products possess a plane of symmetry that passes through the CH₂ bridge and the oxygen of the anhydride. This means that in both isomers:\n*   The two vinylic methyl groups are equivalent.\n*   The two bridgehead methyl groups are equivalent.\n*   The two anhydride protons are equivalent.\n\n**4. Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on typical chemical shifts, we can assign the signals mentioned in the options to the different types of protons in the product:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Protons on carbons adjacent to two carbonyl groups (the anhydride protons) are highly deshielded. This is a very characteristic shift.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinylic methyls) typically appear around 1.6-2.0 ppm.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Methyl groups on saturated carbons (bridgehead methyls) typically appear around 0.8-1.2 ppm.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This must be one of the two protons on the CH₂ bridge. These two protons are diastereotopic (not equivalent) and would couple to each other, forming two doublets (an AB system, which can look like two doublets if Δν >> J).\n\n**5. Analyze the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (through-space interaction, not through bonds). A cross-peak connects the signals of two protons that are spatially near (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the **major** product but absent/weak in the **minor** product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   **In the Endo (Major) Product:**\n    *   The anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are positioned directly under the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). They are very close in space.\n    *   Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl protons** is expected.\n\n*   **In the Exo (Minor) Product:**\n    *   The anhydride ring is flipped away from the vinylic methyl groups. The distance between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons is now large.\n    *   Therefore, the NOE cross-peak between these two groups would be absent or very weak.\n    *   (In the *exo* product, a new NOE between the anhydride protons and the bridgehead methyls (~1.0 ppm) would appear, as these groups are now close).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak that is strong in the major product and absent/weak in the minor product is the one connecting the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl protons**.\n*   Signal for vinylic methyl protons: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n*   Signal for anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n\nThis corresponds to the pair of resonances described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   **The Dienophile:** We start with a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. Dehydration of this acid yields an anhydride.\n        *   The anhydride's 1H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7.0 ppm. This indicates that all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent. A chemical shift of 7.0 ppm is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The fact that they are equivalent suggests a high degree of symmetry.\n        *   The anhydride's 13C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon region) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon region). This indicates there are only two types of carbon atoms.\n        *   The only structure that fits all this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). It has two equivalent vinylic protons (which give the singlet at ~7 ppm) and two types of carbons: two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n    *   **The Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds (a cyclopentadiene core).\n        *   Methyl groups are attached to all four carbons involved in the double bonds (positions 1, 2, 3, and 4).\n        *   The fifth carbon of the ring is a CH2 group.\n        *   The structure is symmetrical.\n\n*   **Step 2: The Reaction and Products.**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition typically produces two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** adduct and the ***exo*** adduct.\n    *   According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* product is formed faster and is usually the **major product** under kinetic control. The *exo* product is more thermodynamically stable and would be the minor product.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3, which is consistent with the sum of the reactants' formulas (Diene C9H14 + Dienophile C4H2O3 = C13H16O3).\n    *   Both the *endo* and *exo* products are bicyclic compounds (specifically, they are derivatives of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene). Both products possess a plane of symmetry, making them achiral (meso compounds).\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of the Products.**\n    *   Due to the plane of symmetry in both products, the number of distinct proton signals is reduced. We expect four signals:\n        1.  **H_anhydride:** The two protons on the part of the structure derived from maleic anhydride. They are equivalent. Expected signal: a **2H singlet**. Based on similar structures, their chemical shift should be downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        2.  **Me_alkene:** The two methyl groups attached to the double bond of the bicyclic system. They are equivalent. Expected signal: a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift should be typical for vinylic methyls, around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        3.  **Me_bridgehead:** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. They are equivalent. Expected signal: a **6H singlet**. They are on quaternary saturated carbons and should be relatively upfield, around ~1.0 ppm.\n        4.  **CH2_bridge:** The two protons of the CH2 bridge. They are enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry and thus are NMR-equivalent. Expected signal: a **2H singlet**, likely between 1.5-2.0 ppm.\n\n*   **Step 4: Interpret the NOESY Spectrum.**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This must be due to a difference in spatial proximity between the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) isomers.\n    *   Let's visualize the stereochemistry:\n        *   In the ***endo*** **(major) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked *under* the newly formed six-membered ring, on the same side as the C7-CH2 bridge. In this orientation, the `H_anhydride` protons are brought into close proximity with the methyl groups on the double bond (`Me_alkene`).\n        *   In the ***exo*** **(minor) product**, the anhydride ring points *away* from the C7-CH2 bridge. In this orientation, the `H_anhydride` protons are far from the `Me_alkene` groups.\n    *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product must be the one connecting the `H_anhydride` protons and the `Me_alkene` protons.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the Resonances to the Options.**\n    *   The key NOE is between the `H_anhydride` protons (a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and the `Me_alkene` protons (a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm).\n    *   Let's examine the choices:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect signal types and resonances.\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect signal type.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be an NOE between `Me_bridgehead` and `Me_alkene`. This proximity exists in both isomers, so it wouldn't be the differentiating peak.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This corresponds exactly to the `Me_alkene` and `H_anhydride` protons. The chemical shifts are reasonable, the signal types match our analysis, and this NOE is characteristic of the major (*endo*) product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   The first reactant is an anhydride derived from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The NMR data provided for this anhydride (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   The single ¹H peak at 7 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent vinylic protons.\n        *   The ¹³C peak at ~137 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent alkene carbons, and the peak at ~165 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n        *   The *cis* geometry of the precursor (maleic acid) is necessary to form the cyclic anhydride upon dehydration.\n\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a conjugated diene.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The *endo* product is usually the major product formed under kinetic control due to favorable secondary orbital interactions, while the *exo* product is the minor (and usually more thermodynamically stable) product. The question explicitly states a major and a minor product are formed.\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of the resulting bicyclic adduct. The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene derivative.\n        *   The cyclopentadiene provides the C1-C4 and C7 carbons of the bicyclic system. The methyl groups from the diene are located at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and the vinylic positions (C2, C3). The methylene group (CH₂) of the diene becomes the C7 bridge.\n        *   The maleic anhydride moiety fuses to the C5 and C6 positions. The two protons from the maleic anhydride are now attached to C5 and C6.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify:\n        *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) → Adduct (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). This matches the given formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and the NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   The key difference between the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products lies in the spatial arrangement of the fused anhydride ring. A NOESY spectrum shows through-space correlations (Nuclear Overhauser Effect) between protons that are close to each other (< 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates the corresponding protons are in close proximity.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor product. This means we must find a pair of proton groups that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n    *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C2=C3 double bond. In this conformation, the protons on the anhydride ring (at C5 and C6) are spatially close to the methyl groups attached to the double bond (the vinylic methyls at C2 and C3).\n\n    *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented away from the C2=C3 double bond. In this conformation, the protons at C5 and C6 are far from the vinylic methyl groups at C2 and C3.\n\n    *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product must be the one connecting the **protons at C5/C6** and the **vinylic methyl groups at C2/C3**.\n\n4.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Resonances:**\n    *   Due to a plane of symmetry in both isomers, pairs of groups are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Protons at C5 and C6:** These two protons are equivalent. They are on sp³ carbons, but they are alpha to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups in the anhydride ring. This deshielding effect will shift their resonance significantly downfield. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is very reasonable for these protons. Since they are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with (C1 and C4 have methyl groups, not protons), they will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **Vinylic Methyl Groups (at C2 and C3):** These two methyl groups are equivalent. They are attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. A typical chemical shift for vinylic methyls is in the range of 1.6-2.0 ppm. Therefore, the signal at **~1.7 ppm** is the correct assignment. As they are equivalent, they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyl Groups (at C1 and C4):** These two methyl groups are also equivalent. They are attached to saturated tertiary carbons. Their chemical shift would be further upfield, around **~1.0-1.2 ppm**. The **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm** in option D corresponds to this group.\n    *   The \"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\" mentioned in options A and B does not correspond to any of the major symmetric groups and likely represents one of the non-equivalent methylene bridge protons at C7.\n\n5.  **Identify the Correct Answer:**\n    *   The key NOE cross-peak connects the protons at C5/C6 and the vinylic methyl groups at C2/C3.\n    *   Based on our assignment, this corresponds to the cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\nLet's review the choices:\nA) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. (Incorrect group)\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. (Incorrect groups; NOE between bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton would not be the defining difference)\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. (This correctly identifies the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons, which show the characteristic NOE difference between endo and exo isomers).\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. (This would be an NOE between bridgehead and vinylic methyls, which should be present in both isomers).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride.\n        *   ¹H NMR of the anhydride: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. A signal at ~7 ppm is typical for vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond) that are deshielded by adjacent electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   ¹³C NMR of the anhydride: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).\n        *   The simplest structure fitting this data is **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent vinylic protons (explaining the single ¹H peak) and two types of equivalent carbons (two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons), explaining the two ¹³C peaks. Maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid) is the corresponding *cis*-dicarboxylic acid.\n\n        ```\n             O\n            // \\\n           C   C=O\n          / \\ /\n        H--C=C--H\n        Maleic Anhydride\n        ```\n\n    *   **Diene:** The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with four methyl groups on the conjugated double bond system (C1-C4) and a CH₂ group at C5.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n3.  **Predict the Products and their Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The stereochemistry of the addition can be either *endo* or *exo*.\n    *   The **endo rule** for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions states that the major product results from the orientation where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are positioned under the newly formed ring, allowing for stabilizing secondary orbital overlap. In this case, the anhydride part of the dienophile will be oriented towards the C=C double bond of the resulting bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   Therefore:\n        *   **Major product = *endo* adduct**\n        *   **Minor product = *exo* adduct**\n    *   The molecular formula of the products is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 3D Structures and NMR Spectra:**\n    *   The problem relies on a 2D NOESY NMR experiment. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The key information is: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor product.\"\n    *   This means we must find a pair of protons that are spatially close in the *endo* isomer (major) but far apart in the *exo* isomer (minor).\n    *   Let's identify the proton signals based on the provided options and general chemical shift knowledge. Both isomers have a plane of symmetry, simplifying the spectra.\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride). They are on carbons C2 and C3 of the bicyclic system.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (the vinylic methyls on C5 and C6).\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4).\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7).\n\n5.  **Correlate Structure with NOESY Data:**\n    *   Let's examine the spatial relationships in the two isomers.\n\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** The anhydride group (and its protons, H_anhydride) is oriented \"endo,\" meaning it points towards the C5=C6 double bond. This brings the H_anhydride protons very close to the vinylic methyl groups attached to C5 and C6. A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two groups of protons.\n\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** The anhydride group (and H_anhydride) is oriented \"exo,\" meaning it points away from the C5=C6 double bond. The distance between the H_anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups is now significantly larger. The NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n    *   This analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem. The cross-peak that distinguishes the major from the minor product is the one between the H_anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   The H_anhydride protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The vinylic methyl protons correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak connects these two signals.\n\n    Let's check the options again:\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm -> Bridgehead Me and Bridge CH. Distances likely similar in both isomers.\n    B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm -> Bridgehead Me and Vinyl Me. Distances are fixed by the rigid frame and are identical in both isomers.\n    C) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** -> Vinyl Me and H_anhydride. Close in endo, far in exo. This is the correct answer.\n    D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> Bridge CH and H_anhydride. These are actually closer in the *exo* (minor) isomer than in the *endo* isomer. This is the opposite of the observation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a chemical reaction and the spectroscopic data of its products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene:** The simplest such acid is *cis*-butenedioic acid, commonly known as maleic acid.\n    *   **Dehydration to an anhydride:** Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride. Let's verify the NMR data provided for this anhydride.\n        *   Structure: Maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring containing an oxygen atom, two carbonyl (C=O) groups, and a C=C double bond. The structure is planar and symmetrical.\n        *   ¹H NMR: Due to the plane of symmetry, the two protons on the double bond are chemically equivalent. Therefore, they should produce a single peak. The problem states a single peak at 7 ppm, which is a typical chemical shift for vinylic protons deshielded by adjacent carbonyl groups. This matches maleic anhydride.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: There are two distinct types of carbon atoms. The two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, and the two alkene carbons are equivalent. This should result in two signals. The problem states two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons), which are characteristic shifts for these functional groups. This confirms the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **The other reactant:** The problem states the anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The cyclopentadiene provides the 4-π electron system, and the double bond of maleic anhydride provides the 2-π electron system.\n    *   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n        *   ***Endo* product:** The electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is oriented on the same side as the newly formed double bond bridge. This is typically the kinetically favored and therefore the **major product**.\n        *   ***Exo* product:** The anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side of the double bond bridge. This is typically the thermodynamically more stable but kinetically disfavored, and therefore the **minor product**.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Check:**\n        *   Diene (C9H14) + Dienophile (C4H2O3) → Adduct (C13H16O3). This matches the formula provided in the problem.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Structures and NMR Spectra:**\n    *   We need to find a feature in the 2D NOESY spectrum that distinguishes the major (*endo*) from the minor (*exo*) product. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (typically < 5 Å). We are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   **Let's visualize the structures:**\n        *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond of the bicyclic system. This brings the two protons from the maleic anhydride moiety very close to the two vinyl methyl groups on that C=C bond.\n        *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the C=C double bond. In this conformation, the anhydride protons are far from the vinyl methyl groups.\n    *   **The Key NOESY Correlation:** The spatial proximity between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl groups is unique to the *endo* isomer. Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between the signals for these two groups of protons will be present (or strong) in the spectrum of the major product (*endo*) and absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor product (*exo*).\n\n4.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product molecule has a plane of symmetry, simplifying the spectrum.\n    *   **Vinyl methyl groups:** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. They will appear as a 6H singlet. Being allylic, their typical chemical shift is around 1.5-2.0 ppm. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is the best fit.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** These are two equivalent methyl groups on saturated, quaternary bridgehead carbons. They are in a shielded environment and will appear as a 6H singlet at a higher field (lower ppm). The **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** is the best fit for these.\n    *   **Anhydride protons:** These are two equivalent protons, each adjacent to two carbonyl groups. They are heavily deshielded and will appear as a 2H singlet. Their chemical shift will be far downfield. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the best fit.\n    *   **Methylene bridge protons:** These two protons are diastereotopic (non-equivalent) and couple to each other, forming two doublets (an AB quartet). One of these would correspond to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Identify the Cross-Peak:**\n    *   Based on our analysis, the cross-peak that distinguishes the major product is between the **anhydride protons** and the **vinyl methyl groups**.\n    *   Using our signal assignments:\n        *   Anhydride protons = 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   Vinyl methyl groups = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl Me). Incorrect.\n    *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge CH) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride H). This interaction would be stronger in the *exo* product. Incorrect.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge CH). Incorrect.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl Me) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride H). **Correct**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has key NMR features: a single proton peak at 7 ppm (¹H NMR) and two carbon peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm (¹³C NMR).\n        *   A single ¹H peak at 7.0 ppm suggests two chemically equivalent protons on a double bond.\n        *   A ¹³C peak at 137 ppm is characteristic of sp² carbons in a double bond (C=C).\n        *   A ¹³C peak at 165 ppm is characteristic of carbonyl carbons (C=O) in an anhydride.\n        *   The simplest molecule fitting this description is **maleic anhydride** (derived from *cis*-butenedioic acid, i.e., maleic acid). It has C₂ᵥ symmetry, making the two vinyl protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. The chemical shifts provided are consistent with this structure.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with a five-membered ring. Four methyl groups are on the four carbons of the conjugated diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4), and a CH₂ group is at C5. This molecule also possesses C₂ᵥ symmetry.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   This reaction is stereospecific. When a cyclic diene reacts with a dienophile, two stereoisomeric products can be formed: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** The Diels-Alder reaction is typically under kinetic control, meaning the product that forms faster is the major product. The *endo* adduct is formed faster due to favorable secondary orbital interactions between the π-system of the diene and the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile. Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structures of the Products:**\n    *   The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton.\n    *   Let's visualize the structures of the endo and exo products. The product is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the newly formed six-membered ring, placing it on the opposite side of the CH₂ bridge (the C7 bridge). This means the anhydride part is spatially close to the double bond (C2=C3) and the methyl groups attached to it.\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"above\" the newly formed six-membered ring, placing it on the same side as the CH₂ bridge. This means the anhydride part is spatially far from the double bond and its methyl groups, but close to the CH₂ bridge.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY NMR Data:**\n    *   A 2D NOESY experiment shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the **major product** but absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the **minor product**.\n    *   This means we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n    *   From our structural analysis:\n        *   In the **endo (major)** product, the protons on the anhydride part (let's call them Hₐ, at positions C5 and C6) are close to the vinylic methyl groups (Meᵥ, at C2 and C3).\n        *   In the **exo (minor)** product, the protons Hₐ are far from the vinylic methyl groups Meᵥ. (Instead, in the exo product, Hₐ would be close to the CH₂ bridge protons).\n    *   Therefore, the unique cross-peak observed in the major product connects the resonances of protons **Hₐ** and the **vinylic methyl groups Meᵥ**.\n\n5.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Resonances:**\n    *   We need to assign the chemical shifts and integrals provided in the options to the different types of protons in the product molecule. The total proton count is 16 (2 from anhydride + 14 from diene).\n    *   **Protons on the anhydride part (Hₐ):** These are two equivalent protons (due to symmetry) on sp³ carbons alpha to carbonyl groups. Their chemical shift should be in the range of 3.0-4.0 ppm. They will appear as a **2H singlet** (or a simple multiplet).\n    *   **Vinylic methyl groups (Meᵥ):** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. Their chemical shift is typically around 1.6-2.0 ppm. They will appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl groups (Meₑₕ):** These are two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These carbons are sterically hindered, and the methyl groups are usually shielded, appearing at a lower chemical shift, around 0.8-1.3 ppm. They will appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Methylene bridge protons (Hₑ):** These two protons at C7 are not equivalent (diastereotopic). They will likely appear as two separate signals (e.g., a pair of doublets due to geminal coupling), integrating to 1H each. Their shifts can vary, but ~1.5 ppm is a reasonable value for one of them.\n\n6.  **Match the Analysis with the Given Options:**\n    *   The cross-peak in the major product is between Hₐ and Meᵥ.\n    *   Our assignment for Hₐ is a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   Our assignment for Meᵥ is a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Meₑₕ) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (one Hₑ proton). This interaction should be present in both isomers.\n        *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Meᵥ) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Hₐ).** This matches our prediction perfectly. This interaction is unique to the endo (major) product.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Meₑₕ) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Meᵥ). This interaction should be present in both isomers as the groups are on adjacent carbons.\n        *   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (one Hₑ proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Hₐ). This interaction would be strong in the exo (minor) product, which is the opposite of what is observed.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects the 6H singlet of the vinylic methyls (~1.7 ppm) and the 2H singlet of the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is key:\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. A signal in this region is typical for vinylic protons (H-C=C-H). A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon, C=O).\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. The chemical shifts are characteristic for this compound.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a C₅ ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 and 3, and a methyl group on each of carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. The C5 carbon is a CH₂ group, but this is an error in typical representation, since C1-C4 have methyls, C5 is just a carbon atom with 2 hydrogens. A quick check of the formula shows: C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n    *   The product is a bicyclic compound. The core structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene system.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula of the product:\n        *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃).\n        *   This matches the molecular formula given in the problem.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (Major and Minor Products)**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** Typically, the major product is the *endo* adduct, formed faster (kinetic product) due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. The minor product is the *exo* adduct, which is usually more stable (thermodynamic product).\n    *   **Steric Effects:** However, the diene used here, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. The four methyl groups create significant steric hindrance. In an *endo* approach, the anhydride ring would be positioned under the diene, leading to severe steric clashes with the methyl groups. In an *exo* approach, the anhydride points away, which is sterically much more favorable.\n    *   For highly substituted dienes like this, it's very common for steric hindrance to override the electronic preference, making the **exo adduct the major product**.\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude:\n        *   **Major Product = *exo* adduct**\n        *   **Minor Product = *endo* adduct**\n\n4.  **Analyze the 3D Structure and NOESY Spectra**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect SpectroscopY) detects protons that are close in space (< ~5 Å). The problem states there is a cross-peak in the major product's spectrum that is absent in the minor one. We need to find an interaction unique to the *exo* adduct.\n    *   Let's analyze the proton positions in each adduct:\n        *   **Major (*exo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the *exo* face (away from the C7 bridge). This means the two protons on the anhydride part of the ring (let's call them **H-anhydride**) are oriented on the **endo** face, tucked \"under\" the newly formed six-membered ring.\n        *   **Minor (*endo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the *endo* face. The **H-anhydride** protons are on the **exo** face.\n    *   Now, let's identify key spatial proximities:\n        *   In the **major (*exo*) adduct**, the **endo-oriented H-anhydride protons** are very close to the **vinylic methyl groups** (the ones on the C=C double bond). A strong NOE is expected between them.\n        *   In the **minor (*endo*) adduct**, the **exo-oriented H-anhydride protons** are far from the vinylic methyl groups. No NOE is expected between them.\n    *   This perfectly explains the observation: an NOE cross-peak between the H-anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons will be present in the major (*exo*) product and absent in the minor (*endo*) product.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option**\n    *   We need to assign the chemical shifts to the protons involved in this distinguishing NOE.\n        *   **H-anhydride protons:** These are two equivalent protons on sp³ carbons adjacent to two carbonyl groups in a rigid bicyclic system. Their chemical shift is typically downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**. They are equivalent, so they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n        *   **Vinylic methyl groups:** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to a double bond (-C=C-CH₃). Their chemical shift is typically around **~1.7 ppm**. They are equivalent and each is a CH₃, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n        *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** These are two equivalent methyl groups on quaternary sp³ carbons. They are more shielded and appear at a higher field (lower ppm), typically around **~1.0 ppm**. They would also be a **6H singlet**.\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak connects the H-anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) and the vinylic methyl protons (~1.7 ppm).\n    *   Let's examine the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n        *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n    *   Option A perfectly matches our deduction: a cross-peak between the 6H singlet of the vinylic methyls (~1.7 ppm) and the 2H singlet of the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Reactants\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum (7 ppm) and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum (137 ppm, 165 ppm).\n    *   A single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm suggests two chemically equivalent protons on a double bond.\n    *   Two ¹³C NMR peaks confirm the high symmetry: one peak for the two equivalent alkene carbons (~137 ppm is a typical chemical shift for electron-deficient alkene carbons) and one peak for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm is a typical shift for an anhydride carbonyl).\n    *   The only molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**, which is formed by the dehydration of *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid).\n    *   **Structure of Maleic Anhydride (the dienophile):**\n        ```\n             O\n            // \\\\\n        H--C----C--H\n          ||    ||\n        O=C----C=O\n            \\  /\n             O\n        ```\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds. There are methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. Position 5 is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n    *   **Structure of the Diene:**\n        ```\n               CH3   CH3\n                \\   /\n                 C = C\n                /     \\\n             H₂C       C=C\n                \\     /  \\\n                 CH3    CH3\n        ```\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reaction and Products\n\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction** between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   This reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Due to the stereochemistry of the approach of the dienophile to the diene, two main stereoisomers can be formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the *endo* adduct is kinetically favored and is therefore the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is thermodynamically more stable but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Structures of the Major and Minor Products\n\n*   **Endo Product (Major):** In the Diels-Alder reaction with cyclopentadiene derivatives, the *endo* configuration means the substituents from the dienophile are on the same side (*syn*) as the one-carbon bridge (the C7 bridge). In this case, the anhydride ring is tucked under the C7 bridge. This places the two protons that were originally on the maleic anhydride (let's call them H_a) on the outer, convex face of the molecule.\n*   **Exo Product (Minor):** The *exo* configuration means the substituents from the dienophile are on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. The anhydride ring points away from the C7 bridge. This places the H_a protons on the inner, concave face of the molecule, close to the C7 bridge.\n\nLet's visualize the key protons/groups in the major (*endo*) product:\n\n```\n      Major (Endo) Product         \n                                      \n             Me   Me  <-- Vinylic Methyls (~1.7 ppm)\n              \\   /                      \n               C=C                       \n              /   \\                      \n      Me----C-------C----Me  <-- Bridgehead Methyls (~1.0 ppm)\n           / \\     / \\                    \n         Ha--C-------C--Ha   <-- Anhydride Protons (~3.5 ppm)\n             \\  \\ /  /                    \n              \\  O  /                     \n               \\ | /\n              O=C-C=O\n                 |\n             C₇H₂ Bridge (behind)\n```\n\nIn the *endo* (major) product, the anhydride protons (H_a) are on the same face as the vinylic methyl groups. They are spatially close.\n\n### 4. Interpret the NOESY Spectra\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å), causing a cross-peak between their signals.\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor product. We need to find an interaction that is unique to the *endo* isomer.\n*   **In the major (endo) product:** The anhydride protons (H_a) and the vinylic methyl groups are on the same convex face of the molecule. Their proximity will generate a strong NOE cross-peak.\n*   **In the minor (exo) product:** The anhydride protons (H_a) are on the concave face, while the vinylic methyl groups are on the convex face. They are far apart, so there will be no NOE cross-peak between them. Instead, H_a protons would be close to the C7 bridge protons in the exo isomer.\n*   Therefore, the differentiating cross-peak connects the anhydride protons (H_a) and the vinylic methyl groups.\n\n### 5. Assign NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option\n\nNow, let's assign the chemical shifts (ppm) to the relevant proton groups based on typical values:\n\n*   **Anhydride Protons (H_a):** These two protons are on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring system. Their chemical shift will be relatively high. A value of **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable. They are chemically equivalent due to a plane of symmetry, so they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n*   **Vinylic Methyls:** These are methyl groups attached to a C=C double bond. A typical chemical shift is **~1.7 ppm**. There are two such groups, and they are equivalent, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyls:** These are methyl groups on saturated, quaternary carbons. A typical shift is **~1.0 ppm**. There are two such groups, and they are equivalent, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n*   **C7 Bridge Protons:** These are two protons on a methylene bridge in a strained bicyclic system. Their shift would be around **~1.5 ppm**. (The \"1H doublet\" in the options is likely a simplification or refers to a potential loss of symmetry, but it is not relevant for identifying the correct NOE pair).\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons. Based on our assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between:\n*   The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (vinylic methyls)\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (anhydride protons)\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nC) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\nOption D perfectly matches our conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene. Dehydration forms an anhydride.\n    *   **NMR of Anhydride:**\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak means all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl).\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).\n    *   These spectral data perfectly match **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making its two vinylic protons equivalent (a singlet at ~7.0-7.3 ppm) and its two carbonyl carbons equivalent (~165 ppm) and its two vinylic carbons equivalent (~137 ppm).\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4) and methyl groups attached to each of these four carbons. The fifth carbon (C5) is a -CH₂- group.\n\n2.  **The Reaction: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a **bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene** derivative.\n    *   The reaction produces two stereoisomers: the **endo** and **exo** products. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry: Endo vs. Exo Selectivity**\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** Typically, Diels-Alder reactions favor the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. This would make the *endo* product the major kinetic product.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** However, the diene used here is extremely bulky. It has four methyl groups on the reacting carbon atoms (C1, C2, C3, C4). This significant steric hindrance can override the electronic preference for the *endo* transition state, making the less hindered *exo* pathway faster.\n    *   Therefore, in this specific case, it is very likely that the **exo product is the major product** (kinetic control) and the **endo product is the minor product**.\n\n4.  **Structure of the Products and NOESY Analysis**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows a cross-peak between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* adduct (major) but far apart in the *endo* adduct (minor).\n    *   Let's analyze the proton signals and their positions in the two isomers.\n        *   **Product Protons:**\n            *   **Vinylic methyls (Me_vinyl):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the newly formed C=C bond. (6H singlet). Expected shift ~1.7 ppm.\n            *   **Bridgehead methyls (Me_bridgehead):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. (6H singlet). Expected shift ~1.0-1.5 ppm.\n            *   **Anhydride protons (H_anhydride):** Two equivalent protons on the carbons originating from maleic anhydride. They are alpha to carbonyls. (2H singlet). Expected shift ~3.0-4.0 ppm.\n            *   **Methylene bridge protons:** Two protons on the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Spatial Proximity in Isomers:**\n        *   **Exo Adduct (Major):** In the *exo* structure, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the C7 bridge. This places its two protons (**H_anhydride**) on the *endo* face of the molecule, pointing \"underneath\" the C=C double bond. This brings them very close to the **vinylic methyl groups (Me_vinyl)**. A strong NOE is expected between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl**.\n        *   **Endo Adduct (Minor):** In the *endo* structure, the anhydride ring points towards the C7 bridge. This places its two protons (**H_anhydride**) on the *exo* face, pointing \"away\" from the C=C double bond and its methyl groups. They are far apart. The NOE between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** would be absent or very weak.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The cross-peak that is present in the major product (exo) but absent in the minor product (endo) must be between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n    *   Let's match these protons to the options provided:\n        *   **Anhydride protons (H_anhydride):** A 2H singlet at a downfield shift, ~3.5 ppm is a very reasonable assignment.\n        *   **Vinylic methyl protons (Me_vinyl):** A 6H singlet around ~1.7 ppm is a very reasonable assignment.\n    *   Now we check the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm -> Incorrect protons/multiplicity.\n        *   B) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** -> This perfectly matches our prediction for the NOE between Me_vinyl and H_anhydride in the major (exo) product.\n        *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> Incorrect protons/multiplicity.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm -> This would be an NOE between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. This interaction would likely exist in both isomers and is not the key distinguishing feature.\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single 1H NMR peak at 7 ppm (alkene region) and two 13C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl C).\n        *   The single 1H peak indicates that the two alkene protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   The two 13C peaks indicate two types of equivalent carbons.\n        *   This data is perfectly consistent with **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by dehydrating *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, matching the NMR data.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   The structure is a five-membered ring with a CH₂ group at C5 and conjugated double bonds at C1=C2 and C3=C4. Each of the four sp² carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) bears a methyl group.\n        *   The molecular formula of the diene is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile.\n    *   The total molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions typically yield two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to these two isomers.\n    *   According to the **Alder endo rule**, the transition state leading to the *endo* product is kinetically favored due to secondary orbital interactions. Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* isomer**, and the **minor product is the *exo* isomer**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry and Structure of the Products:**\n    *   The product has a **bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene** core structure.\n    *   We need to determine the relative positions of the substituents in the *endo* and *exo* isomers to understand their 3D structure and predict NOESY correlations.\n    *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** In the *endo* transition state, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are positioned \"under\" the diene's π-system. In the resulting product, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the six-membered ring from the C7 bridge (the former CH₂ group of the diene). This means the two protons attached to the anhydride-derived part of the skeleton (let's call them H_anhydride, at positions C5 and C6) point *towards* the C7 bridge. They are also situated underneath the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** In the *exo* product, the anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge. The H_anhydride protons point *away* from the C7 bridge.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Assign Proton Signals and Evaluate Spatial Proximities:**\n    *   Based on typical chemical shifts, we can assign the signals mentioned in the options:\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Vinylic methyl groups on C2 and C3 (**Me_vinyl**). They are equivalent due to symmetry.\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Bridgehead methyl groups on C1 and C4 (**Me_bridgehead**). Also equivalent.\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Protons on the anhydride part (**H_anhydride** at C5 and C6). They are α to carbonyls and equivalent.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This describes one of the two diastereotopic protons of the C7 bridge (**H_bridge**). Let's call them H7_syn and H7_anti. They couple to each other, so they appear as two doublets. This resonance represents one of them.\n\n    *   Now, let's analyze the spatial proximities for the NOE interaction unique to the major (*endo*) product.\n\n    *   **In the *endo* (major) isomer:**\n        *   The H_anhydride protons are on the same side as the C7 bridge. Specifically, they are very close to the *anti* proton of the bridge (H7_anti).\n        *   The H_anhydride protons are under the C=C double bond, and thus are relatively far from the Me_vinyl groups.\n\n    *   **In the *exo* (minor) isomer:**\n        *   The H_anhydride protons are on the opposite side of the C7 bridge and are far from its protons.\n        *   The H_anhydride protons are on the same side as the C=C double bond and are close to the Me_vinyl groups.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge):** The bridgehead methyls are close to the C7 bridge in *both* isomers. This NOE is not unique to the major product.\n    *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride):** In the major (*endo*) isomer, the H_anhydride protons are close to the H_bridge protons. In the minor (*exo*) isomer, they are far apart. This matches the condition perfectly.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl):** These adjacent methyl groups are close in *both* isomers. This NOE is not unique to the major product.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride):** These groups are close in the minor (*exo*) isomer, but far apart in the major (*endo*) isomer. This is the opposite of what the question asks for.\n\nConclusion: The only interaction that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product is the one between the bridge protons and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in its ¹³C spectrum.\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Its dehydration product is maleic anhydride.\n    *   Let's check if maleic anhydride's spectral data matches the description. Maleic anhydride has a C₂v symmetry axis.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** The two protons on the double bond are chemically equivalent. They are deshielded by the adjacent electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. A chemical shift around 7 ppm is expected. So, a single peak for these two protons at 7 ppm is consistent with the structure of maleic anhydride.\n        *   **¹³C NMR:** Due to symmetry, there are only two unique carbon environments: the two equivalent olefinic carbons (C=C) and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). Olefinic carbons typically resonate around 100-150 ppm (137 ppm is a good fit), and carbonyl carbons resonate around 160-180 ppm (165 ppm is a good fit).\n    *   Therefore, the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 and 3, methyl groups attached to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a CH₂ group at position 5.\n    *   Molecular formula of maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) + Molecular formula of the diene (C₉H₁₄) gives the product formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   **Stereochemistry and Isomers:** Diels-Alder reactions often produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **endo rule** predicts that the major product is typically the *endo* isomer, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are oriented under the newly formed six-membered ring.\n    *   The *exo* isomer is typically the minor product.\n    *   Thus, the **major product is the *endo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Structure of the Products and Predict NMR Signals**\n\nLet's visualize the structure of the bicyclic adducts and predict their ¹H NMR signals. Both products possess a plane of symmetry that bisects the double bond and the anhydride ring.\n\n*   **Proton Types and Expected Signals:**\n    1.  **Anhydride Protons (H-a):** The two protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. Due to the plane of symmetry, they are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **2H singlet**. Their position, being alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained ring system, would be relatively downfield. The value of **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable.\n    2.  **Vinylic Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the double bond of the newly formed ring. They are equivalent by symmetry. They will appear as a **6H singlet**. Methyl groups on a double bond are typically deshielded compared to those on sp³ carbons. A value of **~1.7 ppm** is a reasonable estimate.\n    3.  **Bridgehead Methyls:** The two methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons. They are also equivalent by symmetry and will appear as a **6H singlet**. These are on saturated (sp³) carbons and should be more shielded (further upfield) than the vinylic methyls. A value of **~1.0 ppm** is plausible.\n    4.  **Methylene Bridge Protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ group that forms the bridge. These two protons are diastereotopic and thus not equivalent. They would likely appear as two separate signals, each coupling with the other (geminal coupling), forming a pair of doublets (an AB system). One of these could correspond to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** mentioned in the options.\n\n**4. Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   **NOESY Principle:** A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected by chemical bonds.\n*   **The Distinguishing Cross-Peak:** The problem states there is a cross-peak present in the major product's spectrum but absent (or weak) in the minor product's spectrum. This means we must find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer (major) but far apart in the *exo* isomer (minor).\n*   **Spatial Analysis of Isomers:**\n    *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond. This geometry brings the **anhydride protons (H-a)** into close spatial proximity with the **vinylic methyl groups**. A strong Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) and thus a strong cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring points away from the C=C double bond. In this arrangement, the **anhydride protons (H-a)** are now far away from the **vinylic methyl groups**. The NOE between them would be very weak or absent.\n\n**5. Match the Interacting Protons to the NMR Signals**\n\n*   The NOESY cross-peak that distinguishes the major and minor products connects the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyls.\n*   From our signal assignment in step 3:\n    *   Anhydride protons = **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n    *   Vinylic methyls = **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n*   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\nThis corresponds perfectly with option A.\n\n*   **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    *   **B) 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This is an interaction between a bridge proton and the anhydride protons. While an interaction might exist, a similar (or even stronger) interaction would also exist in the *exo* isomer, so it would not be a distinguishing peak.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This is between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. They are close in both isomers, so an NOE would be seen in both spectra.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is between the bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton. They are close in both isomers, so an NOE would be seen in both spectra.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which dehydrates to an anhydride. The anhydride has a ¹H NMR spectrum with a single peak at 7 ppm and a ¹³C NMR spectrum with two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   A single ¹H peak suggests the protons are chemically equivalent. The high chemical shift (7 ppm) is characteristic of vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond) that are part of an electron-deficient system.\n    *   Two ¹³C peaks suggest two types of carbon atoms. The peak at 165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl (C=O) carbon in an anhydride. The peak at 137 ppm is in the range for an olefinic (C=C) carbon.\n    *   The simplest molecule fitting this description is **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent vinylic protons (hence one ¹H signal) and two sets of equivalent carbons (two olefinic carbons and two carbonyl carbons, hence two ¹³C signals). Its symmetry and electronic structure perfectly match the provided spectral data.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system where each of the four sp²-hybridized carbons bears a methyl group, and the fifth carbon is a CH₂ group.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\nThe reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a classic [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition. This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Products (Major and Minor)**\n\nThe Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and the *exo* product.\n*   The **endo rule** states that, under kinetic control (which is typical for most Diels-Alder reactions), the major product is the *endo* isomer. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the π-system of the diene and the electron-withdrawing groups (the carbonyls) of the dienophile in the transition state.\n*   The **exo** isomer is usually thermodynamically more stable but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n\nLet's visualize the products:\n*   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene (norbornene) framework.\n*   **Proton/Group Locations:**\n    *   **Vinylic Methyls (Me_V):** Two methyl groups on the double bond of the norbornene ring. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent and appear as a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift should be around 1.7-2.0 ppm.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls (Me_BH):** Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. They are also equivalent by symmetry and appear as another **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically lower, around 1.0-1.3 ppm.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (H_A):** The two protons on the carbons originating from the maleic anhydride. They are equivalent and appear as a **2H singlet**. Being adjacent to carbonyl groups, their shift will be downfield for aliphatic protons, around 3.0-4.0 ppm.\n    *   **Bridge Protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ bridge (C7) are diastereotopic and would likely give two separate signals, possibly coupled to each other.\n\n*   **Structural Difference between *Endo* and *Exo* isomers:**\n    *   In the **endo product (Major)**, the anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond of the norbornene skeleton. This places the anhydride protons (H_A) in close spatial proximity to the vinylic methyl groups (Me_V).\n    *   In the **exo product (Minor)**, the anhydride ring points away from the C=C double bond. This makes the distance between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the vinylic methyl groups (Me_V) much larger.\n\n**4. Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This must correspond to a through-space interaction that is unique to the *endo* (major) isomer.\n*   Based on our structural analysis, the close proximity between the **anhydride protons (H_A)** and the **vinylic methyls (Me_V)** is the defining feature of the *endo* isomer. Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that distinguishes the major product connects these two groups.\n\n**5. Match with the Provided Options**\n\nWe need to find the option that describes the interaction between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the vinylic methyls (Me_V).\n\n*   **Anhydride Protons (H_A):** A 2H singlet with a chemical shift around 3.5 ppm.\n*   **Vinylic Methyls (Me_V):** A 6H singlet with a chemical shift around 1.7 ppm.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This perfectly matches our assignment for the vinylic methyls (Me_V) and the anhydride protons (H_A). The NOE between these two is the key identifier for the major *endo* product.\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This would be an interaction between a bridge proton and the anhydride protons. While an NOE might exist, it's not the most distinct difference between the *endo* and *exo* forms.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This would be an interaction between the bridgehead methyls (~1.0 ppm) and the vinylic methyls (~1.7 ppm). The distance between them is fixed by the rigid frame and should be similar in both isomers.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This would be an interaction between the bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton. Again, this distance is not dependent on the *endo/exo* stereochemistry.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak unique to the major product connects the resonances described in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a \"dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene\" that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The resulting anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride. Due to its C₂ᵥ symmetry, the two vinyl protons are chemically and magnetically equivalent. They appear as a single peak. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is appropriate for vinyl protons next to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   Also due to symmetry, there are only two types of carbon atoms: the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and the two equivalent vinyl carbons (C=C). The peak at ~165 ppm is characteristic for an anhydride carbonyl carbon, and the peak at ~137 ppm is characteristic for a double-bond carbon.\n        *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride** (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   Let's determine its molecular formula to verify the product's formula later. The cyclopentadiene ring has 5 carbons. Four are substituted with methyl groups (C₁-C₄) and C₅ has two hydrogens. There are no other hydrogens on the ring itself. The four methyl groups contribute 4 x 3 = 12 hydrogens. Total hydrogens = 2 (at C₅) + 12 (from methyls) = 14. The formula is **C₉H₁₄**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   The product has a molecular formula of C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's check: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the information given.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes typically form two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the **endo rule**, the *endo* adduct is usually the major product because its transition state is stabilized by secondary orbital overlap. The *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Major Product (Endo Adduct):**\n    *   The product is a tricyclic compound with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   The diene is symmetric (it has a C₂ symmetry axis passing through C₅ and the midpoint of the C₂=C₃ bond). The dienophile is also symmetric. Therefore, the product will have a plane of symmetry (Cs symmetry).\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes pairs of protons and methyl groups chemically equivalent. Let's identify the proton signals we expect in the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls:** The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C₁ and C₄ of the original diene) are equivalent. They are attached to saturated quaternary carbons and should appear as a **6H singlet** at a high field (e.g., ~1.0 ppm).\n        *   **Vinyl Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the double bond (C₂ and C₃ of the original diene) are equivalent. They should appear as a **6H singlet** at a lower field than the other methyls (e.g., ~1.7 ppm).\n        *   **Bridge Protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ bridge (C₅ of the original diene) are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They should appear as a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift is sensitive to the endo/exo geometry.\n        *   **Fused Methine Protons:** The two protons from the maleic anhydride moiety are equivalent. They are alpha to carbonyl groups and should be significantly deshielded, appearing as a **2H singlet** at a low field (e.g., ~3.5 ppm).\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Cross-Peak:**\n    *   The question states that a specific NOESY cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two nuclei are close in space (typically < 5 Å). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Let's compare the spatial arrangement in the two isomers:\n        *   **Endo Isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the diene, on the same side (*syn*) as the C₅H₂ bridge. The two methine protons from the anhydride part (let's call them H_fused) are on the *exo* face of the newly formed ring, pointing \"upwards\". The vinyl methyl groups are also on the \"top\" of the molecule. Therefore, the **H_fused protons are close to the vinyl methyl groups**.\n        *   **Exo Isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C₅H₂ bridge. This means the H_fused protons are now on the *endo* face, pointing \"downwards\". The vinyl methyl groups are still on top. Therefore, the **H_fused protons are far from the vinyl methyl groups**.\n\n    *   This analysis reveals that a NOE between the **vinyl methyl groups** and the **H_fused protons** will be a unique feature of the major (*endo*) product.\n\n5.  **Match Analysis with a Multiple-Choice Option:**\n    *   We need to find the option that describes a cross-peak between the vinyl methyls and the H_fused protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignment in step 3:\n        *   Vinyl methyls = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n        *   H_fused protons = 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   Let's examine the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls). This NOE would likely be present in both isomers, as the distance between these groups is fixed by the carbon skeleton.\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The \"1H doublet\" is inconsistent with the expected symmetry of the product.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. The \"1H doublet\" is inconsistent with the expected symmetry.\n        *   D) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.** This perfectly matches our prediction for the vinyl methyl protons and the H_fused protons, which show a unique spatial proximity in the major (endo) product.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the resonance of the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) and the resonance of the fused methine protons (~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **The Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n        *   ¹H NMR of the anhydride: a single peak at 7 ppm.\n        *   ¹³C NMR of the anhydride: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride.\n        *   Let's check if the NMR data for maleic anhydride matches the description. Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry.\n            *   **¹H NMR:** The two vinylic protons are chemically equivalent. They would show up as a single peak. Protons on a double bond next to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups are expected to be significantly downfield, so a shift of 7 ppm is very reasonable.\n            *   **¹³C NMR:** There are two types of carbons: the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and the two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C). This would result in two peaks. Carbonyl carbons typically resonate around 160-180 ppm (165 ppm fits). Alkene carbons resonate around 100-150 ppm (137 ppm fits).\n        *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃)**.\n\n    *   **The Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The C5 carbon is a CH₂ group.\n        *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition**, a [4+2] reaction between a diene and a dienophile.\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). The molecular formula provided for the products matches the expected sum.\n    *   The reaction yields a major and a minor product. In Diels-Alder reactions, this typically corresponds to the formation of **endo** and **exo** diastereomers. The major product is usually the kinetically favored *endo* adduct, while the minor product is the thermodynamically favored *exo* adduct.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Products**\n    *   The reaction between a cyclic diene (cyclopentadiene derivative) and a dienophile produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton.\n    *   In our case, the product is **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2=C3 bond, the C5-C6 bond, and passes through the C7 atom.\n    *   **Protons in the product:**\n        *   Two bridgehead methyl groups (at C1 and C4). They are equivalent by symmetry. This gives a **6H singlet**.\n        *   Two vinylic methyl groups (at C2 and C3). They are also equivalent by symmetry. This gives a **6H singlet**.\n        *   Two protons on the anhydride part (at C5 and C6). They are equivalent by symmetry and not coupled to any other protons. This gives a **2H singlet**.\n        *   Two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the C=C double bond, one is *anti*). They are geminally coupled to each other, so they will appear as a pair of doublets (an AB system or, if the coupling constant is small compared to the chemical shift difference, an AX system). The problem refers to one of them as a **1H doublet**.\n\n4.  **Assign the NMR Signals**\n    *   We need to assign the given chemical shifts to the proton signals we've identified.\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Protons on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups are downfield. This signal corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring (H5 and H6).\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Vinylic methyl groups (protons on a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond) typically resonate around 1.6-2.5 ppm. This signal corresponds to the methyl groups at C2 and C3.\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Methyl groups on a saturated, tertiary carbon (like a bridgehead) resonate further upfield, typically 0.8-1.5 ppm. This signal corresponds to the methyl groups at C1 and C4.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This corresponds to one of the C7 bridge protons.\n\n5.  **Interpret the NOESY Data**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that is unique to the major (endo) isomer.\n    *   **Endo vs. Exo Stereochemistry:**\n        *   In the **endo** adduct (the major product), the anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the C=C double bond of the bicyclic system due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions during the transition state. This places the anhydride protons (H5, H6) close to the vinylic substituents (the methyl groups at C2, C3).\n        *   In the **exo** adduct (the minor product), the anhydride ring is oriented away from the C=C double bond. The anhydride protons (H5, H6) are far from the vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion from NOESY:** The NOESY cross-peak that is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product must be between the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl groups**.\n\n6.  **Match the Finding to the Options**\n    *   We identified the key NOE as being between:\n        *   The anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   The vinylic methyl protons: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This corresponds directly to option D.\n\n    *   Let's review the other options to confirm:\n        *   A) 6H singlet (~1 ppm) and 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm): Bridgehead methyls and a C7 proton. This proximity might exist in both isomers.\n        *   B) 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm) and 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm): A C7 proton and the anhydride protons. This proximity is expected in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) product.\n        *   C) 6H singlet (~1 ppm) and 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm): Bridgehead methyls and vinylic methyls. The distance is fixed by the rigid bicyclic frame and would be the same in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the only option that describes a NOESY cross-peak characteristic of the major (endo) adduct is the one connecting the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   The first reactant is a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene, which upon dehydration forms an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is given:\n        *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. The value of 7 ppm is in the aromatic/alkene region. A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene region) and 165 ppm (carbonyl region). Two peaks imply there are only two types of carbon atoms in the molecule.\n    *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. Maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid) is a cis-dicarboxylic acid. Its dehydration product, maleic anhydride, has a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. This gives one ¹H signal and two ¹³C signals, consistent with the provided data.\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is the diene for the Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition** between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n\n2.  **Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclic diene and a dienophile can produce two diastereomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   According to the Alder endo rule, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product and is typically the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically more stable product and is typically the **minor product**.\n    *   The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed. We can confidently assign the major product as the *endo* isomer and the minor product as the *exo* isomer.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products:**\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of the resulting bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n        *   The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The diene system involves carbons C1, C2, C3, and C4. The reaction happens between C1 and C4 of the diene and the two carbons of the maleic anhydride double bond.\n        *   In the product, the original C1 and C4 of the diene become the bridgehead carbons, each bearing a methyl group (**bridgehead methyls**).\n        *   The original C2 and C3 of the diene form the new double bond in the bicyclic system, each bearing a methyl group (**vinyl methyls**).\n        *   The original C5 of the diene (a CH2 group) becomes the one-carbon bridge (the **methylene bridge**, C7). This bridge has two diastereotopic protons: **H_syn** (pointing towards the double bond) and **H_anti** (pointing away).\n        *   The carbons from the maleic anhydride form the two-carbon bridge, which includes the anhydride functionality. The two protons on this bridge (**H_b**) are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry in the molecule.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Spatial Relationships (NOE):**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). We need to find an NOE interaction that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride part of the molecule is tucked \"under\" the main six-membered ring, on the same side as the methylene (C7) bridge.\n        *   This geometry places the anhydride protons (**H_b**) very close to the **H_syn** proton on the methylene bridge. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between H_b and H_syn.\n        *   The H_b protons are far from the H_anti proton.\n        *   The bridgehead methyl groups point generally \"up and away\" from the center of the bicyclic cage, making them distant from the endo H_b protons.\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride part is oriented \"up\", away from the methylene bridge.\n        *   This geometry places the anhydride protons (**H_b**) far from the **H_syn** proton. The NOE cross-peak between H_b and H_syn will be absent or very weak.\n        *   The H_b protons are now close to the H_anti proton.\n        *   The H_b protons are also now on the same side as the bridgehead methyl groups, so an NOE may be observed between them.\n\n5.  **Identify the Differentiating Cross-Peak and Match with Options:**\n    *   The NOE interaction that is strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent/weak in the minor (*exo*) product is the one between the anhydride protons (**H_b**) and the **H_syn** proton of the methylene bridge.\n    *   Now, let's assign the NMR signals given in the options to these protons:\n        *   **H_b**: These two equivalent protons are on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. They will be deshielded. The `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` is the correct assignment for H_b.\n        *   **H_syn / H_anti**: These are the two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic and couple to each other (geminal coupling), so they should appear as a pair of doublets. H_syn is shielded by the anisotropy of the nearby C=C bond, so it will appear at a higher field (lower ppm) than H_anti. The `1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm` is a reasonable assignment for one of these protons, most likely H_syn.\n        *   **Methyl groups**: There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the two bridgehead methyls and the two vinyl methyls. These will appear as two `6H singlets`, for example at `~1.0 ppm` and `~1.7 ppm`.\n    *   The diagnostic cross-peak for the major product is between **H_b** and **H_syn**.\n    *   This corresponds to an interaction between the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` and the `1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm`.\n    *   This matches the description in Option D.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: NOE between the two different methyl groups. This is not the primary peak that distinguishes endo from exo.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: NOE between a set of methyl groups and H_b. As argued above, this interaction is expected to be strong in the *minor (exo)* product (between H_b and bridgehead methyls), not the major (endo) product.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: NOE between a methyl group and a bridge proton. This is possible, but the NOE between H_b and H_syn is the classic and most conclusive evidence for the endo geometry.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak present in the major product and absent in the minor product connects the resonances of H_b and H_syn.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n    *   The dienophile is formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. This describes the conversion of maleic acid to maleic anhydride. The NMR data provided for the anhydride (¹H: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are consistent with the symmetric structure of maleic anhydride.\n    *   The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄. The structure consists of a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds (a cyclopentadiene system) and four methyl groups attached to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. The carbon at position 5 is a CH₂ group.\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, matches the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄).\n\n2.  **Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes typically produce two diastereomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n    *   According to the Alder rule, the *endo* product is usually the kinetically favored product (the major product under standard conditions) due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   However, significant steric hindrance can override this electronic preference. In the diene, there are methyl groups at the bridgehead-forming carbons (C1 and C4). For the *endo* transition state, the anhydride moiety of the dienophile must approach from underneath the diene ring, leading to a severe steric clash with these bridgehead methyl groups.\n    *   In the *exo* transition state, the anhydride moiety points away from the bridgehead methyls, though it gets closer to the vinyl methyl groups (on C2 and C3). This steric interaction is generally considered less severe than the clash with the bridgehead methyls in the *endo* approach.\n    *   Therefore, due to steric hindrance, the **exo adduct is the major product**, and the *endo* adduct is the minor product.\n\n3.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n    *   The problem provides four distinct NMR signals and their integrals. Let's assign them to the protons in the product structure (a tetramethyl-substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride). The product has a plane of symmetry, simplifying the spectrum.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinyl methyls) typically resonate around 1.6-1.8 ppm. There are two such equivalent methyl groups (on C2 and C3 of the original diene). This signal corresponds to the **vinyl methyls**.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** Methyl groups on a saturated carbon atom typically resonate around 0.9-1.2 ppm. There are two such equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). This signal corresponds to the **bridgehead methyls**.\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two protons originating from the maleic anhydride. They are now on a saturated carbon framework and are alpha to carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Their equivalence due to symmetry leads to a singlet. This signal corresponds to the **anhydride-derived protons (H_alkane)**.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal represents one of the two diastereotopic protons of the methylene bridge (C7). The other proton would be a separate signal. This corresponds to one of the **bridge protons (H_bridge)**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations between protons that are close in three-dimensional space (typically < 5 Å apart).\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that is unique to the major (*exo*) adduct.\n    *   Let's visualize the structures:\n        *   **Exo Adduct (Major):** The anhydride part (and its protons, H_alkane) is on the same side of the molecule as the C2=C3 double bond. The H_alkane protons (~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the **vinyl methyls** (~1.7 ppm). They are far from the methylene bridge protons.\n        *   **Endo Adduct (Minor):** The anhydride part is tucked underneath, on the same side as the methylene bridge. The H_alkane protons (~3.5 ppm) are far from the vinyl methyls. However, they are close to the **bridge protons** (~1.5 ppm).\n    *   The NOE interaction that is characteristic of the **major (exo) adduct** is the one between the **H_alkane protons** and the **vinyl methyl protons**.\n    *   The NOE interaction that is characteristic of the **minor (endo) adduct** is the one between the **H_alkane protons** and the **bridge protons**.\n    *   Since the observed cross-peak is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product, it must be the correlation unique to the *exo* form.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the H_alkane protons with the vinyl methyl protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic acid:** The problem describes a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid that dehydrates to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   A single ¹H peak at 7 ppm suggests two equivalent vinylic (alkene) protons.\n        *   Two ¹³C peaks suggest a high degree of symmetry. The shifts at 137 ppm (alkene C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl C) are characteristic.\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**, which is formed from the dehydration of *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid).\n        *   Reactant 1 (after dehydration) is maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a cyclic diene (C₅H₂(CH₃)₄), with a molecular formula of C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the formula given in the problem.\n\n3.  **Determine the Products' Stereochemistry:**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes and dienophiles typically produce two stereoisomers: the ***endo*** adduct and the ***exo*** adduct.\n    *   According to the **Alder endo rule**, the *endo* product is kinetically favored and is usually the **major product**. The *exo* product is thermodynamically more stable but forms slower, making it the **minor product**.\n    *   **Endo adduct (Major):** The substituents on the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are oriented on the same side as the bridge formed from the diene (the C7 methylene bridge) and are \"tucked under\" the newly formed six-membered ring.\n    *   **Exo adduct (Minor):** The anhydride ring points away from the C7 bridge.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NMR Data and Structures:**\n    *   The key to solving the problem is the **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** data. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close to each other in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product (*endo*)** but **absent in the minor product (*exo*)**. We need to find the pair of protons that fits this description.\n    *   Let's visualize the *endo* and *exo* structures and identify the key protons and their spatial relationships.\n        *   **Anhydride Protons:** There are two protons on the portion of the molecule that came from maleic anhydride. Due to a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule, these two protons are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a **2H singlet**. Based on the options, this signal is at **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Methyl Protons:** There are four methyl groups attached to the double bond. The same plane of symmetry makes them equivalent in two pairs.\n            *   One pair of methyl groups is on the \"endo\" face, closer to the anhydride ring.\n            *   The other pair is on the \"exo\" face, further from the anhydride ring.\n            *   This results in two distinct **6H singlets**. Based on the options, their shifts are **~1.0 ppm** and **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridge Protons:** The C7 methylene bridge has two protons that are not equivalent (diastereotopic). They will likely appear as two separate signals, each coupling with the other (e.g., two doublets). One of these is given as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Identify the Distinguishing NOE Interaction:**\n    *   We need an interaction that exists *only* in the major (*endo*) product.\n    *   **In the *endo* isomer:** The anhydride ring is tucked under the main ring system. This brings the **anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm)** very close to the pair of **methyl groups on the \"endo\" face**. This close proximity will result in a strong NOE cross-peak.\n    *   **In the *exo* isomer:** The anhydride ring points away from the main ring system. The anhydride protons are now very far from all four methyl groups. Therefore, the NOE between the anhydride protons and the methyl groups will be absent or extremely weak.\n    *   This interaction perfectly fits the description. The cross-peak is between the anhydride protons and one of the methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   The interaction is between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (anhydride protons) and one of the **6H singlets** (methyl protons).\n    *   Let's analyze the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Methyl <=> Bridge Proton): This interaction is likely present in both isomers to some extent.\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Bridge Proton <=> Anhydride Proton): This NOE would be stronger in the *endo* isomer, but the interaction between the anhydride and methyl groups is geometrically more direct and a more classic diagnostic tool for this stereochemistry.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Methyl <=> Methyl): These groups are on opposite sides of a double bond and far apart. No NOE is expected.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Methyl <=> Anhydride Proton): This matches our analysis perfectly. The methyl groups closer to the electron-withdrawing anhydride group are expected to be deshielded (have a higher ppm value), so assigning them the ~1.7 ppm shift is reasonable. This NOE is characteristic of the *endo* adduct.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the resonances of the anhydride protons and the nearby methyl groups.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which upon dehydration forms an anhydride. The spectral data for this anhydride are a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   Let's analyze maleic anhydride, which is formed from *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid).\n        *   **Structure:** Maleic anhydride is a planar, five-membered ring with a C=C double bond and C₂ᵥ symmetry.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** Due to symmetry, the two protons on the double bond are chemically equivalent. They are vinyl protons adjacent to carbonyl groups, so their chemical shift is expected to be significantly downfield. A single peak at ~7 ppm is a perfect match.\n        *   **¹³C NMR:** There are two sets of equivalent carbons: the two vinyl carbons (C=C) and the two carbonyl carbons (C=O). This would give two signals. Carbonyl carbons typically resonate at 160-180 ppm (matching 165 ppm), and alkene carbons at 100-150 ppm (matching 137 ppm).\n    *   Conclusion: The anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction and products.**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The specific skeleton formed from a cyclopentadiene derivative is a **bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene** system.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is given as C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify this.\n        *   Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄) → C₁₃H₁₆O₃. The formula is correct.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two main stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. According to the \"endo rule,\" the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product, while the *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically favored product.\n    *   **Major product = Endo adduct.**\n    *   **Minor product = Exo adduct.**\n    *   Let's visualize the structures. The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene skeleton.\n        *   The anhydride ring is fused at positions C2 and C3.\n        *   Methyl groups are at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and on the double bond (C5, C6).\n        *   A CH₂ group forms the C7 bridge.\n    *   In the **endo adduct (major)**, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side as) the C7 bridge. The two protons on the anhydride part (at C2 and C3) are therefore on the *exo* face.\n    *   In the **exo adduct (minor)**, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side of) the C7 bridge. The two protons at C2 and C3 are on the *endo* face.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the NOESY spectrum.**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially proximate protons.\n    *   We are looking for a cross-peak present in the major product (endo) but absent in the minor product (exo). This requires finding a pair of protons that are close in the endo isomer but far apart in the exo isomer.\n    *   Let's consider the key protons:\n        *   **H(anhydride):** The two equivalent protons at C2 and C3.\n        *   **H(bridge):** The two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge, H-syn (pointing towards the C5=C6 double bond) and H-anti (pointing away from it).\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        *   **In the endo (major) product:** The H(anhydride) protons are on the *exo* face. They are spatially close to the **H-syn** proton on the C7 bridge. They are far from the H-anti proton.\n        *   **In the exo (minor) product:** The H(anhydride) protons are on the *endo* face. They are spatially close to the **H-anti** proton on the C7 bridge. They are far from the H-syn proton.\n    *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak between **H(anhydride) and H-syn** will be present (strong) in the major product and absent (or very weak) in the minor product. This is the distinguishing feature.\n\n*   **Step 4: Assign the NMR signals from the options.**\n    *   The options provide the following signals:\n        *   A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm\n        *   A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n        *   A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n        *   A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n    *   Let's assign these based on typical chemical shifts and the molecular structure:\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are protons on sp³ carbons (C2, C3) adjacent to two carbonyl groups in a strained ring system. This chemical shift is highly characteristic of the **H(anhydride)** protons.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Methyl groups on a double bond (vinylic methyls) typically resonate around 1.6-2.0 ppm. This is likely the two equivalent methyl groups on C5 and C6.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** Methyl groups on a saturated, sp³ bridgehead carbon typically resonate further upfield. This is likely the two equivalent methyl groups on C1 and C4.\n        *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This must correspond to one of the C7 bridge protons (**H-syn** or H-anti). Given that we are looking for its interaction with H(anhydride) in the major product, this signal must be for **H-syn**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Identify the correct option.**\n    *   We have established that the unique cross-peak in the major product is between H(anhydride) and H-syn.\n    *   Based on our signal assignment, this corresponds to a cross-peak between:\n        *   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H(anhydride))\n        *   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (H-syn)\n    *   This matches option B.\n\n    Let's re-check the other options:\n    *   A) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H-syn): An NOE might exist with H-anti, not H-syn. Not the distinguishing feature.\n    *   C) 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl Me) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H(anhydride)): These protons are far apart in both isomers.\n    *   D) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl Me): These are on adjacent carbons, so an NOE is expected in both isomers. Not a distinguishing feature.\n\nThe only option describing an interaction unique to the major (endo) product is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is given:\n    *   `1H NMR`: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two equivalent protons in the same chemical environment, likely vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond) that are deshielded.\n    *   `13C NMR`: Two peaks at 137 ppm (characteristic of C=C carbons) and 165 ppm (characteristic of carbonyl C=O carbons).\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Its dehydration product is **maleic anhydride**. Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinylic protons and a plane of symmetry, matching the `1H` NMR data. It also has two equivalent vinylic carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, matching the `13C` NMR data. Therefore, the anhydride reactant is maleic anhydride.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The second reactant is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene suitable for a Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the reaction and the products.**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The general structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system fused with the anhydride ring.\n*   The reaction produces two stereoisomers: the **endo** and **exo** products. Typically in Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is kinetically favored and thus the **major product**, while the *exo* product is the **minor product**.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3. Let's verify:\n    *   Diene (C9H14): 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    *   Dienophile (C4H2O3): Maleic anhydride.\n    *   Product (C9H14 + C4H2O3 - H2O?) No, it's an addition reaction. Formula of diene is C5H2(CH3)4 = C9H14. Formula of dienophile is C4H2O3. Total: C(9+4)H(14+2)O3 = C13H16O3. The formula given in the question is correct.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of the products and predict their NMR signals.**\n\n*   The product molecule (both endo and exo isomers) has a plane of symmetry.\n*   Let's identify the different types of protons and their expected signals in the `1H NMR` spectrum:\n    1.  **Bridgehead Methyls (`Me_bridgehead`)**: Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Expected chemical shift: ~1.0-1.3 ppm (shielded, attached to sp3 C).\n    2.  **Vinylic Methyls (`Me_vinyl`)**: Two methyl groups on the double bond carbons (C5 and C6). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Expected chemical shift: ~1.7-2.0 ppm (deshielded, attached to sp2 C).\n    3.  **Anhydride Protons (`H_anhydride`)**: Two protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (C2 and C3). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **2H singlet**. Expected chemical shift: ~3.0-4.0 ppm (deshielded by adjacent C=O).\n    4.  **Bridge Protons (`H_bridge`)**: Two protons of the CH2 group at the C7 bridge. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **2H singlet** or an AB quartet. Expected chemical shift: ~1.5-2.5 ppm.\n\n**Step 4: Use the NOESY data to distinguish between the major and minor products.**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The question states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we need to find a pair of proton groups that are close in the major (*endo*) isomer but far apart in the minor (*exo*) isomer.\n*   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 bridge. This geometry places the `H_anhydride` protons (which point away from the bridge) close to the `Me_vinyl` groups on the C5=C6 double bond. **A strong NOE cross-peak between `H_anhydride` and `Me_vinyl` is expected.**\n*   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. This geometry places the `H_anhydride` protons far away from the `Me_vinyl` groups. **The NOE cross-peak between `H_anhydride` and `Me_vinyl` would be absent or very weak.**\n*   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak connects the `H_anhydride` protons and the `Me_vinyl` protons.\n\n**Step 5: Match the proton groups to the signals described in the options.**\n\n*   Based on our chemical shift predictions:\n    *   `H_anhydride` ≈ 3.5 ppm (a 2H singlet)\n    *   `Me_vinyl` ≈ 1.7 ppm (a 6H singlet)\n*   The distinguishing cross-peak in the major product connects the resonance at ~1.7 ppm (6H) and the resonance at ~3.5 ppm (2H).\n*   Let's check the options:\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (problematic signal description).\n    *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (problematic) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`).\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`). The distance between these groups is similar in both isomers, so an NOE would be present in both, not just the major one.\n    *   D) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`)**. This matches our analysis perfectly. The NOE between these two groups is strong in the major (endo) product and weak/absent in the minor (exo) product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic acid and anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride is characterized by:\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak indicates that all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift (7 ppm) is in the vinylic (alkene) region.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. A value around 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride, while a value around 137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon (C=C).\n    *   The high symmetry (one ¹H peak, two ¹³C peaks) and the cis-alkene origin strongly point to **maleic anhydride**. Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry, making its two alkene protons equivalent and its two carbonyl carbons equivalent. The two alkene carbons are also equivalent. This perfectly matches the NMR data.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated system (C1, C2, C3, C4).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and its products.**\n\n*   **Reaction type:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This reaction forms a six-membered ring, resulting in a bicyclic adduct.\n*   **Stoichiometry:** The molecular formula of the diene is C₉H₁₄, and the dienophile is C₄H₂O₃. The product's molecular formula would be C₉₊₄H₁₄₊₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Endo vs. Exo):** Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes typically produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The **Alder Endo Rule** states that the kinetically favored product is the *endo* isomer. This is usually the **major product**.\n    *   The *exo* isomer is thermodynamically more stable but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n    *   The key structural difference between the *endo* and *exo* adducts of cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride lies in the relative orientation of the anhydride ring with respect to the newly formed bicyclic system.\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) the alkene bridge (`-C(Me)=C(Me)-`). This places the protons on the anhydride part (let's call them Hα) in close spatial proximity to the methyl groups on the double bond.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side of) the alkene bridge. This places the Hα protons far away from the methyl groups on the double bond.\n\nLet's visualize the major (*endo*) product:\n```\n         // Endo Isomer (Major Product) //\n\n               CH2 (C7 bridge)\n              /   \\\n      (Me)C1-------C4(Me) (bridgehead)\n         |         |\n      (Me)C5=======C6(Me)  <-- Alkene Methyls are close to...\n           \\       /\n            \\     /\n           Hα-C-----C-Hα    <-- Anhydride Protons\n             |       |\n           O=C-------C=O\n               \\   /\n                 O\n```\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the NOESY NMR data.**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect SpectroscopY)** shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds.\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This cross-peak must correspond to a spatial proximity that exists only in the *endo* isomer.\n*   Based on our structural analysis, the unique proximity in the *endo* (major) product is between the **anhydride protons (Hα)** and the **alkene methyl protons**.\n*   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak connects the signals for these two sets of protons.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the ¹H NMR signals and match with the options.**\n\nNow we need to predict the chemical shifts and multiplicities for the relevant protons in the product.\n\n1.  **Anhydride Protons (Hα):**\n    *   These are two equivalent protons on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups.\n    *   They are equivalent by symmetry, so they should appear as a **singlet**.\n    *   Their integral will be **2H**.\n    *   Their chemical shift will be downfield due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the anhydride. A typical range is **~3.5-4.0 ppm**.\n    *   So, we look for a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n\n2.  **Alkene Methyl Protons:**\n    *   These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to a double bond.\n    *   They are equivalent by symmetry, so they should appear as a **singlet**.\n    *   Their integral will be **6H**.\n    *   The typical chemical shift for vinylic methyl groups is **~1.6-2.0 ppm**.\n    *   So, we look for a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\n3.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:**\n    *   These are two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. They will also be a **6H singlet** but at a higher field (more shielded), typically **~1.0-1.3 ppm**.\n\n4.  **Methylene Bridge Protons (C7-H):**\n    *   These two protons are non-equivalent and would likely form a complex multiplet or an AB quartet.\n\nThe cross-peak in the major product connects the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons. We are looking for the option that describes these two signals.\n\n*   **Signal 1:** 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Anhydride protons)\n*   **Signal 2:** 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Alkene methyls)\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\nOption B perfectly matches our prediction for the two interacting groups of protons. The `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm` corresponds to the alkene methyls, and the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` corresponds to the anhydride protons (Hα). This interaction is unique to the major *endo* isomer, as required by the problem description.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of this anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two equivalent vinylic protons.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This also points to a symmetrical molecule.\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is *cis*-butenedioic acid, also known as maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) perfectly matches the NMR data. The two vinylic protons are equivalent, giving a singlet around 7 ppm. The two vinylic carbons are equivalent (around 137 ppm), and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent (around 165 ppm).\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene** (C₉H₁₄).\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction and its products.**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene) and maleic anhydride (the dienophile).\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is given as C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify this: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. The formula is correct.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n    *   The *Alder endo rule* predicts that the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product, due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene and the dienophile's electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. In our diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, there are methyl groups at carbons C1 and C4, the positions that form the new sigma bonds.\n    *   In the *endo* transition state, the maleic anhydride ring approaches from under the diene ring, causing a significant steric clash between the anhydride and the methyl groups at C1 and C4.\n    *   In the *exo* transition state, the maleic anhydride ring approaches from above, pointing away from the methyl groups at C1 and C4, minimizing steric hindrance.\n    *   Due to this severe steric clash, the **exo adduct is the major product**, and the *endo* adduct is the minor product. This is a classic exception to the endo rule.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry and proton proximities of the products.**\n    *   We use 2D NOESY NMR to determine which protons are close in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of protons that are spatially close. We are looking for a cross-peak present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product.\n    *   **Major Product (Exo Isomer):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the bicyclic system from the C7-methylene bridge. In this geometry, the two protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) are close to the two vinyl methyl groups (at C2 and C3 of the original diene).\n    *   **Minor Product (Endo Isomer):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. In this geometry, the H_anhydride protons are far from the vinyl methyl groups. They are instead close to the protons of the C7 bridge and the bridgehead methyl groups (at C1 and C4).\n    *   Therefore, the NOE interaction (cross-peak) between the **H_anhydride protons** and the **vinyl methyl protons** will be present and strong in the major (exo) product and absent or very weak in the minor (endo) product.\n\n*   **Step 4: Assign the ¹H NMR signals.**\n    *   The product molecule has a plane of symmetry, simplifying the NMR spectrum.\n    *   **H_anhydride protons:** Two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are on sp³ carbons alpha to a carbonyl group in a strained ring system. A typical chemical shift for such protons is around **~3.5 ppm**. They are chemically equivalent and do not have adjacent protons to couple with, so they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **Vinyl methyl groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond. A typical chemical shift for vinyl methyls is **~1.7 ppm**. They are equivalent, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the sp³ bridgehead carbons. These are further from electronegative groups and double bonds. A typical chemical shift is **~1.0 ppm**. They are equivalent, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   The options with \"1H doublet\" (B and C) are inconsistent with the symmetrical structure of the product.\n\n*   **Step 5: Identify the cross-peak.**\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak in the major (exo) product's NOESY spectrum is between the H_anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons.\n    *   Based on our assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option A.\n\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride).** This is the correct pair of resonances, as they are close in space only in the major (exo) product.\n    *   B) Inconsistent integral and splitting pattern.\n    *   C) Inconsistent integral and splitting pattern.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls). These groups are relatively far apart in both isomers, so a strong, distinguishing NOE is not expected.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene dehydrated to an anhydride:** The NMR data for this anhydride (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: 137, 165 ppm) points to maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinyl protons (~7.0 ppm), two equivalent alkene carbons (~135 ppm), and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm), matching the data perfectly.\n    *   **Diene:** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This molecule has a C₅ ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 and 3. There are methyl groups on carbons C1, C2, C3, and C4, and a CH₂ group at C5. The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n\n2.  **Determine the Products:**\n    *   A Diels-Alder reaction creates a new six-membered ring. In this case, it forms a bicyclic adduct with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework.\n    *   The reaction yields two products, a major and a minor one. These correspond to the two possible stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   According to the Alder endo rule, the *endo* adduct is kinetically favored and is therefore the major product. The *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula of the adduct: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given in the question.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products and Predict ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product has a plane of symmetry that bisects the anhydride ring, the newly formed C=C bond, and the C7-methylene bridge.\n    *   This symmetry results in four main sets of proton signals:\n        1.  **Vinylic methyl protons (Me_vinyl):** The two methyl groups on the C=C bond (at C2 and C3 of the bicyclic system) are equivalent. This gives a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically around 1.5-2.0 ppm.\n        2.  **Bridgehead methyl protons (Me_bridgehead):** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (at C1 and C4) are equivalent. This gives a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically lower, around 1.0-1.3 ppm.\n        3.  **Anhydride protons (H_anhydride):** The two protons on the carbons fused to the anhydride ring (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This gives a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift is expected to be higher, around 3.0-4.0 ppm, due to being adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring.\n        4.  **Methylene bridge protons (H_bridge):** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the C=C bond, the other is *anti*). They are not equivalent and would appear as two separate signals, each with an integral of 1H, likely coupled to each other (geminal coupling), appearing as doublets or part of a more complex multiplet. Their chemical shifts are typically in the 1.0-2.0 ppm range.\n\n4.  **Use the NOESY Data to Distinguish Between Endo (Major) and Exo (Minor) Products:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists only in the *endo* isomer.\n    *   **In the endo isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the C2=C3 double bond, on the same side as the C7-methylene bridge. This geometry brings the anhydride protons (H_anhydride) very close to:\n        *   The vinylic methyl groups (Me_vinyl).\n        *   The *syn*-proton of the C7-methylene bridge (H_bridge_syn).\n    *   **In the exo isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring points away from the C=C bond and the C7-bridge. The distances between H_anhydride and both Me_vinyl and H_bridge are much larger.\n    *   Therefore, an NOE cross-peak between H_anhydride and either Me_vinyl or H_bridge_syn will be strong in the major (endo) product and absent/weak in the minor (exo) product.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   Let's assign the signals from the options to the protons we identified:\n        *   A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm -> **Me_vinyl**\n        *   A 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm -> **Me_bridgehead**\n        *   A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> **H_anhydride**\n        *   A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm -> **H_bridge** (likely the *syn* proton)\n    *   Now let's check which option describes an interaction specific to the endo isomer:\n        *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride).** This corresponds to the spatial proximity between the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons. This NOE is strong in the endo isomer and absent in the exo isomer. This is a very strong candidate.\n        *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge).** This interaction is present in both isomers. It is not a differentiating peak.\n        *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl).** The distance between these two sets of methyl groups is determined by the rigid bicyclic framework and would be similar in both isomers.\n        *   **D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride).** This corresponds to the proximity between a bridge proton and the anhydride protons. This NOE is also strong in the endo isomer and absent in the exo.\n\n6.  **Choose the Best Answer:**\n    *   Both options A and D describe valid NOE correlations that are unique to the major (endo) product.\n    *   However, the interaction in option A is between a group of 6 protons (Me_vinyl) and a group of 2 protons (H_anhydride). The interaction in option D is between 1 proton (H_bridge) and 2 protons (H_anhydride).\n    *   The intensity of an NOE cross-peak is proportional to the number of interacting protons. The interaction described in A (involving 6 protons and 2 protons) will give rise to a significantly more intense cross-peak than the one in D (involving 1 proton and 2 protons), assuming similar distances.\n    *   The question refers to \"*a* cross-peak\" that differentiates the isomers, suggesting the most prominent and characteristic one. The NOE between the anhydride protons and the protons on the vinylic system (in this case, the methyl groups) is the classic textbook example used to identify the endo adduct in these reactions.\n\nTherefore, the most likely and prominent differentiating cross-peak connects the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Identify the Molecules:**\n    *   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a ¹H NMR with a single peak at 7 ppm (implying all protons are equivalent, located on a double bond) and a ¹³C NMR with two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This high degree of symmetry and the spectral data point unequivocally to **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The problem explicitly states this is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene locked in the *s-cis* conformation required for a Diels-Alder reaction. It has a five-membered ring containing a C₁=C₂-C₃=C₄ diene system, with methyl groups on each of these four carbons, and a -CH₂- group at C₅.\n    *   **The Reaction:** A Diels-Alder reaction between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n2.  **Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction creates a bicyclic adduct. Because the diene is cyclic, two stereoisomers are possible: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** The *endo* rule states that for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the adduct where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the carbonyls of the anhydride) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed ring is the major product. In this case, it means the anhydride ring will be tucked \"under\" the diene, on the same side as the C₅-methylene bridge (which becomes the C₇ bridge of the product).\n    *   Therefore, the **major product** is the ***endo* adduct** and the **minor product** is the ***exo* adduct**.\n\n3.  **Account for the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Maleic Anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) + Tetramethylcyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₂) → Diels-Alder Adduct (C₁₃H₁₄O₃).\n    *   The problem states the final products have a formula of **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This means two hydrogen atoms have been added to the initial adduct (C₁₃H₁₄O₃ + H₂ → C₁₃H₁₆O₃).\n    *   This implies a **reduction** reaction occurred after the Diels-Alder reaction. The only reducible group is the C=C double bond in the newly formed six-membered ring (the original C₂=C₃ bond of the diene).\n    *   So, the overall process is a Diels-Alder reaction followed by the catalytic hydrogenation of the product's double bond.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 3D Structure and NOESY Predictions for the Major Product:**\n    *   **Structure:** We start with the *endo* adduct. Let's orient it with the C₇ methylene bridge pointing \"up\". In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is also pointing \"down\", *syn* to the C₇ bridge. This means the two protons on the anhydride fusion point (let's call them H_anhydride) are in an *exo* orientation, pointing \"up and away\".\n    *   **Reduction Step:** The C=C double bond is hydrogenated. The hydrogen atoms (H₂) will add from the sterically least hindered face. The *endo* face (bottom) is very crowded by the anhydride ring. Therefore, the H₂ adds from the *exo* face (top). This places the two new protons (let's call them H_internal) in *exo* positions, and pushes the two methyl groups that were on the double bond (Me_internal) into the *endo* positions.\n    *   **Final Major Product Structure Summary:**\n        *   `H_anhydride` (protons at C₅,C₆): *exo*-oriented.\n        *   `Me_internal` (methyls at C₂,C₃): *endo*-oriented.\n        *   `Me_bridgehead` (methyls at C₁,C₄): Fixed at bridgehead positions.\n    *   **NOESY Proximity:** NOESY detects through-space proximity. Let's analyze key distances in the rigid bicyclic frame.\n        *   The *exo*-oriented `H_anhydride` protons are close to the bridgehead positions (C₁ and C₄). Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak is expected between `H_anhydride` and `Me_bridgehead`.\n        *   `H_anhydride` (exo) and `Me_internal` (endo) are on opposite faces of the molecule, so any NOE between them would be weak or absent.\n\n5.  **Analyze the 3D Structure and NOESY Predictions for the Minor Product:**\n    *   **Structure:** We start with the *exo* adduct. The C₇ bridge is \"up\", and the anhydride ring is also \"up\" (*anti* to the C₇ bridge). This puts the `H_anhydride` protons in an *endo* orientation, pointing \"down\".\n    *   **Reduction Step:** As before, H₂ adds from the less hindered face, pushing `Me_internal` into the *endo* position.\n    *   **Final Minor Product Structure Summary:**\n        *   `H_anhydride`: *endo*-oriented.\n        *   `Me_internal`: *endo*-oriented.\n        *   `Me_bridgehead`: Fixed at bridgehead positions.\n    *   **NOESY Proximity:**\n        *   Both `H_anhydride` and `Me_internal` are in the crowded *endo* region. They will be close in space, resulting in a strong NOE.\n        *   The *endo*-oriented `H_anhydride` protons are now far away from the `Me_bridgehead` methyls. No NOE is expected between them.\n\n6.  **Identify the Distinguishing Cross-Peak:**\n    *   **Major Product:** Has an NOE between `H_anhydride` and `Me_bridgehead`.\n    *   **Minor Product:** Does **not** have an NOE between `H_anhydride` and `Me_bridgehead`.\n    *   The question asks for the cross-peak **present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product**. This is clearly the cross-peak connecting `H_anhydride` and `Me_bridgehead`.\n\n7.  **Assign NMR Signals and Select the Correct Option:**\n    *   First, let's assign the signals described in the options to the proton groups we've identified.\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This is characteristic of protons on a carbon alpha to two carbonyl groups in a rigid system. This must be `H_anhydride`.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm & 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the two sets of methyl groups, `Me_bridgehead` and `Me_internal`. In the major product, the `Me_internal` groups are in the crowded *endo* position, which typically causes shielding (an upfield shift to lower ppm). The `Me_bridgehead` groups are in a more open environment. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign:\n            *   `Me_internal` = 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm\n            *   `Me_bridgehead` = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak connects `H_anhydride` (~3.5 ppm) and `Me_bridgehead` (~1.7 ppm).\n    *   Now, let's check the given options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_internal <=> Me_bridgehead)\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n        *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   D) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (`Me_bridgehead` <=> `H_anhydride`)\n    *   Option D perfectly matches our conclusion. The cross-peak connects the resonance for the bridgehead methyls (~1.7 ppm) and the resonance for the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid that forms an anhydride upon dehydration. This anhydride has specific NMR characteristics:\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift (7 ppm) is in the vinylic or aromatic region.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).\n    *   This description perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. Maleic acid is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Upon dehydration, it forms a cyclic anhydride. Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making its two vinylic protons equivalent (hence one ¹H NMR peak) and its two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons equivalent (hence two ¹³C NMR peaks). The chemical shifts provided are also characteristic of maleic anhydride. So, the dienophile is maleic anhydride.\n    *   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (C1=C2-C3=C4) and methyl groups attached to all four of these carbons. The fifth carbon (C5) is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n\n*   **Step 2: The Diels-Alder Reaction.**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a [4+2] cycloaddition, also known as a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The stereochemistry of the reaction is important. Two main products can be formed: the *endo* and the *exo* isomer.\n    *   The **Endo Rule** for Diels-Alder reactions states that the kinetic product (the one formed faster, usually the major product under non-reversible conditions) is the *endo* isomer. In the *endo* isomer, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are tucked underneath the newly formed cyclohexene ring.\n    *   The *exo* isomer, where the anhydride part points away from the ring system, is usually the thermodynamically more stable product but forms more slowly, making it the minor product.\n    *   Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the structure of the products and their predicted ¹H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Both the *endo* and *exo* products have the same molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Dienophile C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃), which matches the problem statement.\n    *   Both products have a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=C bond, the anhydride oxygen, and the CH₂ bridge. This symmetry simplifies the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n    *   Let's predict the key proton signals based on the structure of the adduct:\n        *   **Vinyl methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups are attached to the double bond of the product. They will appear as a single peak, integrating to 6H. Typical chemical shift for vinyl methyls is ~1.7-2.0 ppm. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons. These are on saturated carbons and should be more shielded (upfield). They will appear as a single peak, integrating to 6H. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride protons:** The two protons on the carbons that were originally part of maleic anhydride are equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring system. Their chemical shift would be relatively downfield. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridge protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ bridge are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the double bond, the other is *anti*). They should appear as two distinct signals, coupled to each other (i.e., two doublets). One of these is likely the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Use the NOESY information to distinguish between the major and minor products.**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product (*endo*)** and **absent in the minor product (*exo*)**. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   **In the *endo* isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is tucked *underneath* the bicyclic system. This brings the anhydride protons (the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the vinyl methyl groups (the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm) on the double bond above them. A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two groups.\n    *   **In the *exo* isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring is pointing *away* from the bicyclic system. The anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are now very far from the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). No NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   This observation perfectly matches the problem statement. The specific cross-peak that appears in the major (*endo*) product but not the minor (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the protons to the options.**\n    *   The protons involved are:\n        *   The vinyl methyl groups: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n        *   The anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n    *   These two resonances are connected by the unique cross-peak in the major product. This corresponds to option B.\n\nLet's check the other options for completeness:\n*   A) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm, vinyl Me): These groups are far apart in both isomers.\n*   C) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, bridge H): Their distance is similar in both isomers.\n*   D) 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, bridge H) and 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm, anhydride H): These are close in the *exo* (minor) product and far in the *endo* (major) product. This is the opposite of what is observed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7.0 ppm, and the ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   A single ¹H NMR peak indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The shift at 7.0 ppm is in the vinylic region.\n        *   Two ¹³C NMR peaks indicate two types of carbons. The shift at 137 ppm is typical for an alkene carbon (C=C), and 165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride.\n        *   The structure that perfectly fits this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). It has two equivalent vinylic protons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, consistent with the spectra. Its formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is stated to be **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. Let's verify its molecular formula is consistent with the product formula.\n        *   Product formula: C₁₃H₁₆O₃\n        *   Anhydride formula: C₄H₂O₃\n        *   Subtracting the anhydride from the product leaves the diene's contribution: C₁₃H₁₆O₃ - C₄H₂O₃ = C₉H₁₄.\n        *   Now let's determine the formula of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. A cyclopentadiene ring (C₅H₆) has methyl groups replacing hydrogens at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. This means the four hydrogens on the double-bonded carbons are replaced by methyl groups. The C5 carbon remains a CH₂ group. The formula is C₅H₂(CH₃)₄, which simplifies to C₉H₂₊₁₂ = C₉H₁₄.\n        *   The molecular formulas are consistent.\n\n2.  **The Reaction: Diels-Alder**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   According to the *endo rule*, the kinetically favored product is the *endo* adduct, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed ring. In this case, the C₂=C₃ double bond from the diene becomes a double bond within the new six-membered ring.\n    *   The reaction yields two products: a major and a minor one. The major product is the *endo* isomer, and the minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Structures and NOESY Spectra**\n    *   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n    *   The question states a key cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or very weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n4.  **Proton Assignments in the Product**\n    Let's analyze the protons in the product. The product (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride) has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (Hₐ):** There are two equivalent protons on the carbons that came from maleic anhydride. These are bridgehead-type protons on a saturated ring, alpha to carbonyl groups. A chemical shift of ~3.5 ppm is reasonable. Due to the symmetry and lack of adjacent protons (the bridgeheads are substituted with methyl groups), this signal should be a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **C7-Bridge Protons:** The C5 position of the original cyclopentadiene becomes the C7 bridge, which is a CH₂ group. The two protons are diastereotopic (one is *syn* and one is *anti* with respect to the C₂=C₃ double bond). They are not equivalent and will couple to each other, appearing as two **1H doublets**. Their chemical shifts are typically in the aliphatic region, ~1-2 ppm.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:**\n        *   There are two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These would give a **6H singlet** at a lower field, ~1.0 ppm.\n        *   There are two equivalent methyl groups on the vinylic carbons (C2 and C3). These would give a **6H singlet** at a slightly higher field than the other methyls due to the double bond, ~1.7 ppm.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Discriminating NOE**\n    Let's compare proton proximities in the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n    *   ***Endo* Isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side of the molecule as the C7-bridge. This places the anhydride protons (Hₐ) very close to one of the C7-bridge protons (specifically the one pointing away from the double bond, the *anti*-proton). A strong NOE is expected between them.\n    *   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the molecule from the C7-bridge. The anhydride protons (Hₐ) are now very far from both C7-bridge protons. No NOE is expected between them.\n\n    This Hₐ ↔ H(C7) interaction is the classic way to distinguish *endo* and *exo* isomers in Diels-Alder adducts of cyclopentadiene.\n\n6.  **Matching with the Options**\n\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is an interaction between a bridgehead methyl group and a C7 proton. This distance is fixed and should be present in both isomers.\n    *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This corresponds to the interaction between a C7-bridge proton (1H doublet, ~1.5 ppm) and the anhydride protons (2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm). This matches our analysis perfectly: this NOE should be present and strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This is an interaction between a vinylic methyl group and the anhydride protons. This interaction would also be stronger in the *endo* isomer, but the Hₐ ↔ H(C7) distance change is more dramatic and unambiguous.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This is an interaction between the two different types of methyl groups. Their relative distance is fixed and does not depend on the *endo*/*exo* stereochemistry.\n\n    The most definitive cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor is the one described in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Dicarboxylic acid and anhydride**: The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which upon dehydration forms an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR spectrum has a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   A single peak in the ¹H NMR means all protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n    *   Two peaks in the ¹³C NMR mean there are only two types of carbon atoms.\n    *   A chemical shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (vinyl protons) that are electron-deficient.\n    *   A chemical shift of ~165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon (C=O), and ~137 ppm is typical for an alkene carbon (C=C).\n    *   This information perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from maleic acid (a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid). It has two equivalent vinyl protons and two sets of equivalent carbons (two alkene carbons and two carbonyl carbons).\n*   **Diene**: The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene suitable for a Diels-Alder reaction. It has four methyl groups on the conjugated double bond system (C1 to C4) and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction**: The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n### 2. Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry\n*   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes typically produce two stereoisomeric products: an ***endo*** adduct and an ***exo*** adduct.\n*   The Alder rule states that the *endo* product is usually the major, kinetically-favored product, while the *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically-favored product (but formed more slowly).\n*   The problem states a major and a minor product are formed. We can assign the **major product as the *endo* isomer** and the **minor product as the *exo* isomer**.\n*   **Structure of the Adducts**: The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene framework.\n    *   The C5-CH₂ group of the diene becomes the C7 one-carbon bridge of the bicyclic system.\n    *   The original C1/C4 carbons of the diene (with their methyl groups) become the bridgehead carbons.\n    *   The original C2/C3 carbons of the diene (with their methyl groups) form the new double bond in the product.\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused to the remaining two carbons.\n*   **Stereochemical Difference**:\n    *   In the ***endo* adduct (major product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same side as the C7 bridge (*syn* to the bridge), causing it to be \"tucked under\" the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   In the ***exo* adduct (minor product)**, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge (*anti* to the bridge), pointing away from the rest of the bicyclic structure.\n\n### 3. Analyze the NOESY NMR Spectrum\n*   **NOESY**: This 2D NMR technique shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å), regardless of their through-bond connectivity.\n*   **The Differentiating Cross-Peak**: The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent (or weak) in the minor product's spectrum. This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships**:\n    *   Let's identify the key protons in the products:\n        *   **Anhydride protons (H_succinic)**: The two protons on the succinic anhydride ring. By symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **2H singlet**. Their chemical environment (alpha to two carbonyl groups) suggests a shift around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Vinyl methyl groups (Me_vinyl)**: The two equivalent methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond. Signal: **6H singlet**. Shift **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead methyl groups (Me_bridgehead)**: The two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4). Signal: **6H singlet**. Shift **~1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **C7-bridge protons**: The two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments, one *syn* to the C2=C3 double bond and one *anti*). They will appear as two separate signals, each a **1H doublet** (due to geminal coupling). The *syn* proton is closer to the double bond, and its signal is typically around **~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   **In the *endo* (major) product**: The anhydride ring is tucked under the bicyclic system, placing its protons (H_succinic) very close to the *syn* proton on the C7 bridge.\n    *   **In the *exo* (minor) product**: The anhydride ring points away from the bicyclic system, so its protons are far from all other protons, including the C7-bridge protons.\n*   **Conclusion**: The strong NOE cross-peak observed only for the major (*endo*) product must be between the **anhydride protons (H_succinic)** and the **C7-syn proton**.\n\n### 4. Match Analysis with the Given Options\nLet's match the interacting protons with the NMR data provided in the options:\n*   Interacting protons: **H_succinic** and **C7-syn proton**.\n*   Resonance for H_succinic: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   Resonance for C7-syn proton: **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_succinic). These protons are far apart in the *endo* isomer.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7-syn). The distance between these protons is fixed by the rigid frame and should be the same in both *endo* and *exo* isomers. An NOE here would not be unique to the major product.\n*   C) **A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7-syn) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_succinic).** This matches our analysis perfectly. These protons are close only in the major (*endo*) product.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl). The distance is the same in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the resonances of the C7-syn proton and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (Anhydride):** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak (δ=7 ppm) and two ¹³C NMR peaks (δ=137 ppm, δ=165 ppm).\n    *   The single ¹H peak indicates two equivalent vinylic protons. The shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons in an electron-deficient system.\n    *   The ¹³C peaks at 165 ppm and 137 ppm correspond to carbonyl carbons and alkene carbons, respectively, in an anhydride ring.\n    *   This highly symmetric structure is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    *   This is a cyclic, conjugated diene. The base formula for cyclopentadiene is C₅H₆. Replacing four hydrogens on the double-bond carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) with methyl groups gives a formula of C₅H₂ (from the ring) + 4×(CH₃) = C₉H₁₄.\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Diels-Alder reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   The reaction yields a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the problem statement.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. According to the endo rule, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored, major product. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically favored, minor product.\n    *   **Major product = *endo* adduct**\n    *   **Minor product = *exo* adduct**\n\n**2. Structure of the Products and Proton Assignments**\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the *endo* and *exo* products and assign the protons based on the provided NMR data.\n\nThe product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n*   The original maleic anhydride protons become two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are adjacent to carbonyls, so their chemical shift will be downfield. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** corresponds to these protons (**Hₐ**).\n*   The four methyl groups from the diene end up in two different environments in the product:\n    *   Two methyl groups are at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). These are tertiary alkyl methyls. The **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** corresponds to these bridgehead methyls (**Me_bh**).\n    *   Two methyl groups are on the double bond (C5 and C6). These are vinylic methyls. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** corresponds to these vinylic methyls (**Meᵥ**).\n*   The CH₂ group of the cyclopentadiene becomes the C7 methylene bridge of the bicyclic product. The two protons of this bridge are diastereotopic (they are in different chemical environments). They are designated as *syn* (pointing towards the double bond) and *anti* (pointing away from the double bond). The *syn* proton is typically shielded and appears at a higher field. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** is characteristic of one of these bridge protons (**H_syn**), being a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other bridge proton.\n\n**3. Analysis of the NOESY Spectra**\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) reveals protons that are close to each other in 3D space (< 5 Å). We need to find an NOE interaction that is present in the *endo* product (major) but absent in the *exo* product (minor).\n\n*   ***Endo* Adduct (Major Product):** In the *endo* conformation, the anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the main bicyclic framework, on the same side as the C7 bridge (*syn* to the bridge). This brings the anhydride protons (**Hₐ**) very close to the *syn* proton on the C7 bridge (**H_syn**). Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between **Hₐ** and **H_syn** is expected.\n\n*   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor Product):** In the *exo* conformation, the anhydride ring is oriented \"above\" the main bicyclic framework, on the opposite side of the C7 bridge (*anti* to the bridge). In this arrangement, the anhydride protons (**Hₐ**) are far from the C7 bridge protons. No NOE between **Hₐ** and **H_syn** is expected. Instead, the **Hₐ** protons are now close to the vinylic methyls (**Meᵥ**).\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. Based on our analysis, this unique cross-peak corresponds to the spatial interaction between the anhydride protons (**Hₐ**) and the *syn*-bridge proton (**H_syn**), which only occurs in the *endo* isomer.\n\n*   The signal for **Hₐ** is the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   The signal for **H_syn** is the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nThe question asks which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak. The correct answer must be the pair corresponding to these two signals.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (**Me_bh**) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (**H_syn**). Plausible interaction, but should be present in both isomers.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (**Me_bh**) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (**Meᵥ**). Plausible interaction, but should be present in both isomers.\nC) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (**H_syn**) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (**Hₐ**). This is the key NOE that is present only in the major (*endo*) product. This matches the question's description.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (**Meᵥ**) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (**Hₐ**). This NOE is characteristic of the minor (*exo*) product, not the major product.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride. This anhydride is the actual dienophile in the reaction.\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent protons on a double bond. The high chemical shift (7 ppm) is characteristic of protons on a double bond that are deshielded by adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (carbonyls). The singlet nature confirms their equivalence.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). The presence of only two peaks confirms a high degree of symmetry: the two alkene carbons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent.\n    *   Structure: These spectral data perfectly match **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid).\n\n    ```\n        O                O\n       // \\              // \\\n      C---C     - H₂O   C---C\n     / \\ / \\   ------>   \\ / \\ /\n    HO-C=O C=O-OH         C=O H\n                         /\n                        O\n    Maleic Acid        Maleic Anhydride\n    ```\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a cyclic diene with two conjugated double bonds (at positions 1 and 3) and methyl groups on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The remaining carbon of the ring is a CH₂ group (C5).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Product Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Diels-Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition between a conjugated diene and a dienophile. The reaction forms a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product Structure:** The reaction between cyclopentadiene (or its derivatives) and a dienophile results in a bridged bicyclic system, specifically a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Endo vs. Exo):** Diels-Alder reactions can form two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n    *   The **endo rule** predicts that the kinetic product (major product) is the one where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the bicyclic system. In this case, it means the anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the newly formed six-membered ring.\n    *   The **exo product** (thermodynamically more stable, but formed slower, thus the minor product) has the anhydride oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the bridge.\n    *   Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* isomer**, and the **minor product is the *exo* isomer**.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Major Product and Assign NMR Signals**\n\n*   Let's visualize the structure of the major (*endo*) product. It will have a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene skeleton (the new double bond is formed between C2 and C3 of the original diene).\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C7 bridge and the anhydride oxygen.\n    *   Let's identify the key proton groups based on the options provided:\n        1.  **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). They are equivalent due to symmetry. Expected signal: a **6H singlet**. Being standard tertiary alkyl methyls, they will be the most upfield signal, around **~1 ppm**.\n        2.  **Alkene Methyls:** Two methyl groups on the double bond (C2 and C3). They are also equivalent. Expected signal: a **6H singlet**. Being vinylic methyls, they are more deshielded than alkyl methyls, around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        3.  **Anhydride-Bridge Protons:** The two protons on the carbons that were part of the maleic anhydride double bond (now C5 and C6 of the bicyclic system). They are equivalent. They are alpha to carbonyl groups. Expected signal: a **2H singlet** at a downfield shift, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        4.  **C7 Bridge Protons:** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the C2=C3 double bond, one *anti*). They would give two separate signals, each coupling with the other (geminal coupling), appearing as a pair of doublets. A chemical shift of **~1.5 ppm** is reasonable for one of these protons.\n\n**4. Analyze the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY spectroscopy detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å), revealing through-space correlations.\n*   We are looking for a cross-peak **present in the major (*endo*) product** but **absent in the minor (*exo*) product**. This means we need to find a spatial proximity that is unique to the *endo* geometry.\n*   Let's compare the spatial arrangement in the two isomers:\n    *   ***Endo* Isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring, with its two protons (`H_anhydride_bridge`), is tucked under the C2=C3 double bond. This places the `H_anhydride_bridge` protons very close to the `Me_alkene` groups that are attached to the C2=C3 double bond. Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between these two groups is expected.\n    *   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is flipped away from the C2=C3 double bond. The `H_anhydride_bridge` protons are now far from the `Me_alkene` groups. The NOE interaction between them would be very weak or completely absent.\n\n**5. Match the Interaction with the Options**\n\n*   The key discriminating NOE interaction is between the **Alkene Methyls** and the **Anhydride-Bridge Protons**.\n*   Let's match these groups to their signals from step 3:\n    *   Alkene Methyls: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n    *   Anhydride-Bridge Protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   The cross-peak connects these two resonances. Now let's check the given options:\n\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7-H). This interaction would likely exist in both isomers.\n    B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7-H) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride_bridge). This is also a plausible *endo*-specific interaction, but the one in D involves more protons and rotating methyl groups, often leading to a stronger NOE.\n    C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene). These are adjacent on the ring skeleton; the interaction exists in both isomers.\n    D) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride_bridge).** This perfectly matches our analysis. This interaction is strong and characteristic of the *endo* isomer but absent in the *exo* isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (Anhydride):** We need to identify a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that, upon dehydration, forms an anhydride with specific NMR properties.\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent and are in the alkene region.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene region) and 165 ppm (carbonyl region). The presence of only two peaks implies a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   Let's consider maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid). Its dehydration product is maleic anhydride.\n        *   Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) possesses a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. This would lead to one ¹H signal and two ¹³C signals (one for the C=C carbons and one for the C=O carbons).\n        *   The chemical shifts match perfectly: ¹H protons of maleic anhydride are at ~7.1 ppm, the alkene carbons are at ~137 ppm, and the anhydride carbonyl carbons are at ~165 ppm.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The C5 carbon is a CH₂ group.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   The reaction can produce two stereoisomeric products: the **endo** adduct and the **exo** adduct. These are the major and minor products mentioned. The molecular formula of the adduct (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) is consistent with the combination of the diene (C₉H₁₄) and the dienophile (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n*   **The Spectroscopic Data:** We need to use 2D NOESY NMR to determine the structure of the major product.\n    *   A NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å), regardless of whether they are coupled through bonds.\n    *   A key cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product. This means this cross-peak represents a spatial proximity that is unique to the major isomer.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Endo vs. Exo Products and Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product has a bicyclic core.\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused to the main frame. The two protons from maleic anhydride (let's call them **H_fuse**) are now on saturated carbons. Due to a plane of symmetry in both endo and exo products, these two protons are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. The options suggest this is the signal at **~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The four methyl groups from the diene are now on the double bond of the bicyclic system. The plane of symmetry makes them fall into two sets: two methyls are *syn* to the C7 bridge, and two are *anti*. This should give two **6H singlets**. The options provide signals at **~1 ppm** and **~1.7 ppm** for these.\n    *   The CH₂ group from the diene becomes the C7 methylene bridge. Its two protons are diastereotopic and not relevant to the options involving singlets, but are likely the source of the \"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\".\n\n*   **Key Spatial Difference:** The crucial difference between the endo and exo products is the orientation of the fused anhydride ring.\n    *   **Exo Adduct:** The anhydride ring points 'up', away from the C7 bridge and on the same side as the *syn* face of the C2=C3 double bond. In this orientation, the **H_fuse** protons are spatially close to one set of the methyl groups.\n    *   **Endo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is tucked 'down', underneath the C2=C3 double bond and towards the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the **H_fuse** protons are far from the methyl groups but are close to the bridge protons on C7.\n\n*   **Identifying the Major Product:** The Alder Endo Rule states that the endo product is typically the kinetic major product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. However, this rule can be overridden by strong steric hindrance.\n    *   In this reaction, the diene has four bulky methyl groups. In the endo transition state, the incoming anhydride would clash severely with the methyl groups at positions C2 and C3.\n    *   The exo approach is much less sterically hindered. Due to this overwhelming steric factor, the **exo product is expected to be the major product** (it is both kinetically and thermodynamically favored).\n\n**3. Interpreting the NOESY Data**\n\n*   Since the **Exo adduct is the major product**, the unique cross-peak observed in its spectrum must correspond to the proximity unique to the exo geometry.\n*   As established, the unique proximity in the Exo adduct is between the **H_fuse** protons and the nearby **methyl groups**.\n*   The unique proximity in the minor Endo adduct would be between the **H_fuse** protons and the C7 bridge protons.\n*   The problem states the cross-peak is present in the major product. Therefore, it must be the NOE correlation between the H_fuse protons and a set of methyl protons.\n*   Let's match this to the signals given in the options:\n    *   Signal for H_fuse: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   Signal for one of the methyl sets: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (or the one at ~1.0 ppm).\n*   The NOESY cross-peak connects these two signals.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak in the major (Exo) product's NOESY spectrum connects the resonance for the two equivalent protons on the fused ring portion (H_fuse) with the resonance for the six equivalent protons of the nearby methyl group set. Option D describes exactly this correlation.\n\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** NOE between the two methyl groups. Likely present in both isomers.\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** NOE between a bridge proton and H_fuse. This would be characteristic of the minor (Endo) product.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** NOE between a methyl group and a bridge proton. Likely present in both isomers.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** NOE between a methyl group and H_fuse. This is characteristic of the major (Exo) product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Dienophile:**\n    *   The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride.\n    *   This anhydride has a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   A single ¹H NMR peak indicates that all protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. A chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of alkene protons.\n    *   The two ¹³C NMR peaks correspond to the alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and the carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm).\n    *   This specific set of data uniquely identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry that makes its two alkene protons equivalent and its two alkene carbons equivalent, as well as its two carbonyl carbons equivalent. Its molecular formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n\n2.  **Identify the Diene and Analyze Stoichiometry:**\n    *   The diene is given as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Let's determine its structure and formula. It's a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4, and methyl groups attached to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. The carbon at position 5 is a CH₂ group. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₂.\n    *   The product of a simple Diels-Alder reaction between the diene (C₉H₁₂) and the dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) would be C₁₃H₁₄O₃ (C₉H₁₂ + C₄H₂O₃).\n    *   However, the problem explicitly states the molecular formula of the products is **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This product has two more hydrogen atoms than the expected Diels-Alder adduct.\n    *   This discrepancy implies that the Diels-Alder reaction is followed by a reduction step, specifically the hydrogenation of the remaining double bond in the bicyclic adduct.\n    *   So, the reaction sequence is:\n        1.  Diels-Alder: C₉H₁₂ + C₄H₂O₃ → C₁₃H₁₄O₃ (endo/exo isomers)\n        2.  Hydrogenation: C₁₃H₁₄O₃ + H₂ → C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (saturated endo/exo isomers)\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclic diene and a dienophile typically yields two stereoisomers: the *endo* product (major, kinetically favored) and the *exo* product (minor, thermodynamically favored).\n    *   **Major Product (derived from *endo* adduct):** In the initial *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the one-carbon bridge (the C7-CH₂ group). The double bond in this adduct is sterically hindered from the *endo* face by the anhydride ring itself. Therefore, catalytic hydrogenation (addition of H₂) will occur from the less hindered *exo* face. This pushes the two methyl groups that were on the double bond into the *endo* position. The final major product has both the anhydride ring's protons and the two methyl groups on the C5-C6 bridge in the *endo* position.\n    *   **Minor Product (derived from *exo* adduct):** In the initial *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7-CH₂ bridge. Now, the *exo* face of the double bond is hindered by the anhydride ring. Hydrogenation will occur from the *endo* face. This pushes the two methyl groups into the *exo* position. The final minor product has both the anhydride ring's protons and the methyl groups on the C5-C6 bridge in the *exo* position.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are coupled through bonds.\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent (or weak) in the minor product's spectrum. We need to find a pair of protons that are close only in the major isomer.\n    *   **In the major product (hydrogenated *endo* adduct):** As determined above, the protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule are *endo*, and the methyl groups on the C5-C6 part of the skeleton are also *endo*. Due to the rigid, cage-like structure of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane system, these two sets of *endo* groups are forced into close proximity. Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **In the minor product (hydrogenated *exo* adduct):** The corresponding protons (on the anhydride) and methyl groups are both in the *exo* position. In the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework, *exo* groups on the C2/C3 bridge and the C5/C6 bridge are on opposite sides of the molecule and far apart. Thus, no significant NOE cross-peak is expected.\n    *   This analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Identify the Cross-Peak:**\n    *   We need to identify the signals for the two groups involved in the NOE of the major product.\n    *   **Signal 1: The protons on the anhydride ring.** The product has a plane of symmetry, making these two protons equivalent. They are attached to carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. Their chemical shift would be relatively high, around 3.0-4.0 ppm. The integral would be 2H. Looking at the options, **a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is a perfect match.\n    *   **Signal 2: The methyl groups at the C5 and C6 positions.** The symmetry plane also makes these two methyl groups equivalent. They are on saturated (sp³) carbons in a strained ring. Their signal would be a singlet with an integral of 6H. A typical chemical shift for such methyl groups is around 1-2 ppm. From the options, **a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is the most reasonable assignment. (The other 6H singlet at ~1 ppm likely corresponds to the bridgehead methyl groups, which are in a different chemical environment).\n    *   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak in the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (endo methyls) and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (endo anhydride protons).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The choice that matches this conclusion is: **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Anhydride Reactant**\n\n1.  The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n2.  The resulting anhydride's ¹H NMR spectrum has a single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak means all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (vinylic protons).\n3.  The anhydride's ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks: 165 ppm and 137 ppm. The peak at ~165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride. The peak at ~137 ppm is typical for a vinylic carbon.\n4.  For all protons to be equivalent and all vinylic carbons to be equivalent, and all carbonyl carbons to be equivalent, the molecule must be highly symmetrical.\n5.  The simplest structure that fits all this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). It has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. This perfectly matches the provided NMR data.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Reaction and Diene**\n\n1.  The anhydride (maleic anhydride) is reacted with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n2.  Maleic anhydride is an excellent dienophile (due to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene is a diene.\n3.  The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products**\n\n1.  The Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclic diene (cyclopentadiene derivative) and a dienophile can form two stereoisomers: an *endo* product and an *exo* product.\n2.  According to the **endo rule**, the product where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are tucked \"under\" the newly formed six-membered ring is the kinetically favored product. This means the **endo product is the major product**. The *exo* product, where the anhydride group points away, is the thermodynamically favored but kinetically slower-forming product, making it the **minor product**.\n3.  Let's visualize the structures:\n    *   The core structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n    *   The double bond of this system is substituted with four methyl groups (from the diene). For the purpose of analyzing the NOESY data, we can consider them as two sets: two methyl groups pointing \"up\" and two \"down\", but for simplicity, the crucial part is their location on the double bond. Wait, let's re-examine the diene. 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The double bonds are C1=C2 and C3=C4. Methyls are on C1, C2, C3, and C4. In the Diels-Alder reaction, the new double bond forms between the original C2 and C3. So the new double bond will have two methyl groups on it. The original C1 and C4 become the bridgehead carbons, and they will each have a methyl group.\n    *   The succinic anhydride ring is fused to the molecule.\n    *   Let's identify the key protons:\n        *   **Protons on the anhydride part (H_anhydride):** Two equivalent protons on the five-membered anhydride ring. Let's predict their signal: adjacent to carbonyls, they will be downfield, likely a **2H singlet around 3-4 ppm**.\n        *   **Methyl groups on the double bond (Me_vinylic):** Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond. Their signal will be a **6H singlet around 1.5-2.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (Me_bridgehead):** Two equivalent methyl groups on saturated carbons. Their signal will be a **6H singlet, upfield, around 1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Methylene bridge protons (H_bridge):** Two diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ bridge. They would likely form a complex multiplet (an AB quartet), probably in the 1-2 ppm range.\n    *   **Spatial Relationships in the Isomers:**\n        *   **Endo product (major):** The anhydride ring is on the same face as the double bond. Therefore, **H_anhydride are close in space to Me_vinylic**.\n        *   **Exo product (minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite face of the double bond. Therefore, **H_anhydride are far from Me_vinylic**. They are instead close to the H_bridge protons.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the NOESY Data and Answer the Question**\n\n1.  A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n2.  The problem states: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\"\n3.  This means we are looking for a pair of proton signals corresponding to protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n4.  Based on our analysis in Step 3, the pair of protons that fits this description is **H_anhydride and Me_vinylic**.\n5.  Now, we match these proton groups to the signals described in the options:\n    *   **H_anhydride** corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Me_vinylic** corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n6.  The question asks which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak. The answer is the resonance for H_anhydride and the resonance for Me_vinylic.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Option**\n\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinylic):** These are far apart in both isomers.\n*   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (one H_bridge):** These are likely close in both isomers. This cross-peak would not distinguish between major and minor.\n*   **C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (one H_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride):** These are close in the minor (*exo*) product, not the major (*endo*) product. This is the opposite of the observation.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinylic) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride):** These are close in the major (*endo*) product and far in the minor (*exo*) product. This perfectly matches the experimental description.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and the Reaction.**\n    *   The first reactant is described as a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene which dehydrates to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is given: a single peak at 7 ppm in ¹H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in ¹³C NMR.\n        *   The dehydration of a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid like maleic acid yields maleic anhydride.\n        *   Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry. The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, which would give a single peak in the ¹H NMR. The value of ~7 ppm is characteristic of deshielded alkene protons adjacent to carbonyl groups.\n        *   It also has two types of carbons: two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). This would give two signals in the ¹³C NMR. The shifts of ~137 ppm (alkene) and ~165 ppm (carbonyl) are consistent with this structure.\n        *   Therefore, the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry.**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring. When a cyclic diene reacts with a dienophile, it forms a bicyclic system. In this case, the product is a derivative of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene.\n    *   The molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ is consistent with the addition of C₉H₁₄ (the diene) and C₄H₂O₃ (the anhydride).\n    *   The reaction can produce two diastereomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct. This accounts for the major and minor products mentioned.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** Typically, the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital overlap in the transition state. The *endo* product is the kinetic product.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance Exception:** However, the diene used here is heavily substituted with four methyl groups. In the *endo* transition state, where the dienophile (maleic anhydride) tucks \"under\" the diene, there would be significant steric repulsion between the anhydride and the methyl groups on the diene. In such cases of severe steric hindrance, the *exo* transition state is lower in energy, and the *exo* product becomes the major product. This is a crucial exception to the general endo rule.\n    *   Therefore, we can hypothesize:\n        *   **Major product = *Exo* isomer**\n        *   **Minor product = *Endo* isomer**\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products and Predict the NMR Signals.**\n    *   Let's analyze the general structure of the product: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride. Due to a plane of symmetry passing through the C7 bridge and the middle of the C2=C3 and C5-C6 bonds, several groups of protons are equivalent.\n    *   We expect the following signals in the ¹H NMR:\n        *   **`Me(alkene)`:** The methyl groups on the double bond (at C2 and C3) are equivalent. They would appear as a **6H singlet**. Vinylic methyls typically resonate around 1.6-2.0 ppm.\n        *   **`Me(bridgehead)`:** The methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (at C1 and C4) are equivalent. They would appear as another **6H singlet**. These alkyl methyls would resonate further upfield, around 1.0 ppm.\n        *   **`H(anhydride)`:** The protons on the anhydride part of the ring (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. They are alpha to carbonyl groups and are deshielded. They should appear as a **2H singlet**, likely downfield (~3-4 ppm).\n        *   **`H(bridge)`:** The two protons of the CH₂ group at C7 are diastereotopic and would give more complex signals, likely two separate 1H multiplets.\n    *   Matching the expected signals with those in the options:\n        *   `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm` corresponds to **`Me(alkene)`**.\n        *   `6H singlet at ~1 ppm` corresponds to **`Me(bridgehead)`**.\n        *   `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` corresponds to **`H(anhydride)`**.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Data.**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a key cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. We need to find a pair of protons whose spatial proximity is different in the *exo* and *endo* isomers.\n    *   **Exo Isomer (Major Product):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (away) from the C7 bridge. This places the anhydride protons `H(anhydride)` on the same face of the bicyclic system as the C2=C3 double bond. Consequently, the `H(anhydride)` protons are **close** to the **`Me(alkene)`** groups. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **Endo Isomer (Minor Product):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (towards) the C7 bridge. This places the `H(anhydride)` protons on the opposite face from the C2=C3 double bond. The `H(anhydride)` protons are **far** from the **`Me(alkene)`** groups. No NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   This analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation: the cross-peak is present in the major (*exo*) product and absent in the minor (*endo*) product. The cross-peak is between the `H(anhydride)` protons and the `Me(alkene)` protons.\n\n5.  **Identify the Final Answer.**\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects the `H(anhydride)` protons and the `Me(alkene)` protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignments in step 3:\n        *   `H(anhydride)` resonates as a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n        *   `Me(alkene)` resonates as a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   We need to find the option that lists these two resonances.\n\n    *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\n    Option D correctly identifies the two resonances that are connected by the unique cross-peak in the major product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a Diels-Alder reaction and the interpretation of NMR data, specifically a 2D NOESY spectrum, to determine the structure of the major product.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants\n\n*   **Dienophile:** We are given a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which dehydrates to an anhydride. The anhydride has a very simple NMR spectrum:\n    *   ¹H NMR: one peak at 7 ppm. The high chemical shift is characteristic of alkene protons deshielded by electron-withdrawing groups (the anhydride carbonyls). A single peak means the protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). Two peaks imply that the two alkene carbons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent.\n    *   This description perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**, which is formed by the dehydration of *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). The two alkene protons are equivalent due to the molecule's C₂ᵥ symmetry.\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring with two conjugated double bonds.\n    *   Methyl groups are attached to all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4).\n    *   The fifth carbon (C5) is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n### Step 2: The Diels-Alder Reaction and its Products\n\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n*   The reaction between a cyclic diene and a substituted dienophile can yield two major stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** The Diels-Alder reaction is typically under kinetic control, favoring the formation of the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene and the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile during the transition state. Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* isomer**, and the minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n*   Let's visualize the structures:\n    *   **Product Skeleton:** A bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core is formed. The C5-CH₂ group of the diene becomes the C7 bridge of the product. A new six-membered ring is formed, containing a double bond between the original C2 and C3 of the diene.\n    *   **Substituents:**\n        *   Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4).\n        *   Two methyl groups on the alkene carbons (C2, C3).\n        *   An anhydride ring fused at C5 and C6. The two protons from maleic anhydride are on these carbons.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:**\n        *   ***Endo* product (major):** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side) to the C7-CH₂ bridge. The two protons on the anhydride part are therefore *anti* (on the opposite side) to the bridge and point \"up\" towards the C2=C3 double bond.\n        *   ***Exo* product (minor):** The anhydride ring is positioned *anti* to the C7-CH₂ bridge. The two protons on the anhydride part are therefore *syn* to the bridge and point \"down\" away from the C2=C3 double bond.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the NOESY Spectrum\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å apart). A cross-peak appears between the signals of two protons that have a mutual NOE.\n*   The problem states a crucial fact: a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n*   Let's analyze the spatial proximities in each isomer:\n    *   ***Endo* isomer (major):** The two anhydride protons (let's call them H_anhydride) point towards the C2=C3 double bond. They are spatially close to the methyl groups attached to this double bond (let's call them Me_alkene). A strong NOE is expected between H_anhydride and Me_alkene.\n    *   ***Exo* isomer (minor):** The H_anhydride protons point away from the double bond. They are far from the Me_alkene groups. No significant NOE is expected between them. Instead, the H_anhydride protons are now close to the *syn* proton of the C7-CH₂ bridge.\n\n*   The observed NOE (present in major, absent in minor) must therefore be between **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n\n### Step 4: Assign NMR Signals and Match to Options\n\nNow, we need to predict the ¹H NMR signals for these protons.\n*   **H_anhydride protons:** These are two equivalent protons on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. They are significantly deshielded. A chemical shift around **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable. Due to the molecule's symmetry and typical dihedral angles in this system, the coupling to bridgehead protons is often negligible, leading to a **singlet**. The integral is for **2H**. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Me_alkene protons:** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinylic methyls). Their chemical shift is typically in the range of 1.7-2.1 ppm. They are equivalent and have no protons on adjacent carbons to couple with, so they will appear as a **singlet**. The integral is for **6H**. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Other protons for comparison:**\n    *   **Me_bridgehead protons:** Two equivalent methyl groups on saturated bridgehead carbons. They are shielded and would appear at a lower chemical shift, around **~1.0 ppm**, as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   **CH₂ bridge protons:** These two protons are typically inequivalent and would show a more complex pattern (e.g., an AB quartet or two doublets) around ~1.5 ppm.\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak connects the signal for H_anhydride with the signal for Me_alkene. Based on our assignments, this is the cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect proton group/integral.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This perfectly matches our analysis.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect proton groups.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be an NOE between the bridgehead methyls and the alkene methyls. This interaction would exist in both *endo* and *exo* isomers and therefore does not fit the problem description.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the resonances for the vinylic methyl groups and the protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (indicating two equivalent vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl C=O). This is characteristic of maleic acid being dehydrated to maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride is a symmetric molecule, which accounts for the simple NMR spectra.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system at carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each of these carbons has a methyl group. Carbon 5 is a methylene (CH₂) group. This diene is also symmetric.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   This reaction is stereospecific and typically produces two stereoisomers when a cyclic diene is used: the *endo* product and the *exo* product.\n    *   According to the Alder rule, Diels-Alder reactions under kinetic control (which is the usual case) favor the formation of the *endo* product. Therefore, the *endo* adduct is the major product, and the *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products and Their Symmetry:**\n    *   The reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene framework with a fused anhydride ring.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of both the diene and the dienophile, the products (*endo* and *exo*) will each possess a plane of symmetry (Cₛ). This symmetry plane bisects the C=C double bond, the C7 methylene bridge, and the anhydride group.\n    *   This symmetry makes pairs of protons and methyl groups chemically equivalent. In the ¹H NMR spectrum, we expect to see:\n        *   One singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C5, C6). Let's call these **Me_alkene**. These are vinylic methyls and should have a chemical shift around 1.6-2.0 ppm. This is a **6H singlet**.\n        *   One singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4). Let's call these **Me_bridgehead**. These are methyls on saturated carbons and should appear upfield, around 1.0-1.3 ppm. This is another **6H singlet**.\n        *   One singlet for the two equivalent protons on the carbons carrying the anhydride ring (C2, C3). Let's call these **H_anhydride**. These protons are alpha to two carbonyl groups and should be downfield, around 3-4 ppm. This is a **2H singlet**.\n        *   The two protons of the C7 methylene bridge (H_syn and H_anti) are diastereotopic. They will couple to each other, giving rise to two **1H doublets** (an AB quartet), unless they are accidentally isochronous (have the same chemical shift).\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find an interaction that is unique to the *endo* geometry.\n    *   Let's visualize the 3D structures:\n        *   In the **endo adduct (major product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the C5-C6 double bond. This arrangement brings the **H_anhydride** protons (at C2 and C3) very close to the **Me_alkene** groups (at C5 and C6). A strong NOE between these two groups is expected.\n        *   In the **exo adduct (minor product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the C5-C6 double bond. This moves the **H_anhydride** protons far from the **Me_alkene** groups. Therefore, the corresponding NOE would be absent or very weak.\n    *   This confirms that the distinguishing cross-peak connects the **H_anhydride** protons and the **Me_alkene** protons.\n\n5.  **Match the Analysis to the Options:**\n    *   The cross-peak connects the signal for H_anhydride with the signal for Me_alkene.\n    *   Signal for H_anhydride: A **2H singlet** with a chemical shift around 3.5 ppm.\n    *   Signal for Me_alkene: A **6H singlet** with a chemical shift around 1.7 ppm.\n    *   Now we look at the choices:\n        *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\n    *   Option C perfectly matches our findings: a cross-peak between the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene) and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride). The chemical shifts are also very plausible for these groups.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene, which dehydrates to an anhydride. The anhydride's spectral data are key:\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent protons in the vinylic region (C=C-H).\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon, C=O).\n        *   The high symmetry (one proton signal, two carbon signals) and the nature of the precursor (*cis*-dicarboxylic acid) point unequivocally to **maleic anhydride**. It has a C₂ᵥ symmetry axis, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. The two sp² carbons of the double bond are also equivalent. Thus, we expect one ¹H signal and two ¹³C signals, which perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Diene:** This is explicitly given as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile.\n    *   This reaction is stereospecific and stereoselective. It typically yields two major stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and the *exo* adducts.\n    *   **Alder's Endo Rule:** For kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is favored. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the π-system of the diene and the unsaturated substituents on the dienophile in the transition state. The major product mentioned in the problem is the *endo* adduct, and the minor product is the *exo* adduct.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Structures (Endo vs. Exo):**\n    *   The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. Let's map the atoms from the reactants to the product:\n        *   The C1 and C4 of the diene become the bridgehead carbons of the product. They each bear a methyl group.\n        *   The C2 and C3 of the diene become the carbons of the new double bond (C5=C6 in standard norbornene nomenclature). They each bear a methyl group.\n        *   The C5 of the diene (a -CH₂- group) becomes the single-carbon C7 bridge.\n        *   The maleic anhydride moiety adds across the diene to form the C2-C3 part of the product, containing the two protons and the fused anhydride ring.\n    *   **The crucial definition of *endo* and *exo* in this system:** The *endo* position is *syn* (on the same face) to the longer bridge, which is the two-carbon C5=C6 bridge with the methyl groups. The *exo* position is *anti* to this bridge (and thus *syn* to the shorter C7 methylene bridge).\n    *   **Major Product (Endo):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C5=C6 double bond. This places the protons of the anhydride part (let's call them H_A) in close spatial proximity to the methyl groups on the double bond (let's call them Me_vinyl).\n    *   **Minor Product (Exo):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C5=C6 double bond. This places the H_A protons far from the Me_vinyl groups. Instead, they are close to the protons on the C7 bridge.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**. This must be the correlation that is unique to the *endo* geometry.\n    *   Based on our structural analysis in step 3, the unique spatial proximity in the major (*endo*) product is between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the vinylic methyl groups (Me_vinyl).\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in question connects the NMR signals for H_A and Me_vinyl.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Match to Options:**\n    *   Let's analyze the signals given in the options based on their integration and typical chemical shifts:\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This corresponds to the two equivalent anhydride protons (H_A). The chemical shift is reasonable for protons alpha to two carbonyl groups in a strained ring.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent vinylic methyl groups (Me_vinyl). The shift is characteristic for methyl groups attached to a double bond.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** This corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent bridgehead methyl groups. Methyl groups on saturated (sp³) carbons typically appear further upfield.\n        *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is likely one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge.\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major product is between H_A (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) and Me_vinyl (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet).\n    *   This correlation is described in option C.\n\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Bridgehead methyls and vinylic methyls. These are on opposite \"ends\" of the C1-C2-C3-C4 part of the ring and are too far apart.\n    *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** A bridge proton and the anhydride protons. This interaction would be characteristic of the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons. This matches our prediction for the major (*endo*) product.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** The bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton. This interaction is plausible but is not the key differentiator between the endo and exo isomers in the same way.\n\nThe correct answer is the option describing the spatial proximity unique to the major (*endo*) product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is given:\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   The symmetry suggested by a single ¹H peak for alkene protons points to a symmetrical molecule. The chemical shifts are characteristic of maleic anhydride. Maleic acid is the *cis*-dicarboxylic acid, and its dehydration product is maleic anhydride.\n    *   In maleic anhydride, the two alkene protons are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry, giving one singlet in the ¹H NMR spectrum. Their chemical shift around 7 ppm is expected due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   The two alkene carbons are equivalent (around 137 ppm), and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent (around 165 ppm). This matches the ¹³C NMR data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 and 3. There are four methyl groups on carbons C1, C2, C3, and C4. The remaining carbon, C5, is a methylene group (CH₂).\n\n**2. The Reaction: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   The reaction forms a bridged bicyclic product. The resulting skeleton is based on bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction can form two diastereomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* product is formed faster and is usually the major product under kinetic control (lower temperatures, shorter reaction times). The *exo* product is more thermodynamically stable and would be the major product under thermodynamic control (higher temperatures, longer reaction times). The problem statement implies a kinetic mixture by mentioning \"a major and a minor product,\" so it's safe to assume:\n        *   **Major product = Endo adduct**\n        *   **Minor product = Exo adduct**\n*   **Product Structure:** The molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ matches the sum of the reactants (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Anhydride C₄H₂O₃). The product is 1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride. Both isomers have a plane of symmetry.\n\n**3. Analyze the Product Structure and Predict ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nDue to the plane of symmetry in both isomers, we expect the following signals:\n*   **Two vinylic methyl groups (at C5, C6):** Equivalent, giving a **6H singlet**. These are on sp² carbons, so they will be somewhat deshielded (~1.7 ppm).\n*   **Two bridgehead methyl groups (at C1, C4):** Equivalent, giving a **6H singlet**. These are on sp³ carbons, so they will be more shielded (~1.0 ppm).\n*   **Two anhydride methine protons (at C2, C3):** Equivalent, giving a **2H singlet**. They are alpha to carbonyl groups and will be significantly deshielded (~3.5 ppm).\n*   **Two bridge methylene protons (at C7):** These are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They will appear as two separate signals, each integrating to 1H, and they will be coupled to each other (geminal coupling), likely forming an AB quartet (appearing as two doublets). A chemical shift of ~1.5 ppm for one of them is reasonable.\n\n**4. Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY shows correlations between protons that are close in space (< 5Å).\n*   The key information is: **A cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor product.**\n*   We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer (major product) but far apart in the *exo* isomer (minor product).\n\n*   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C7 bridge.\n    *   In this conformation, the anhydride methine protons (at C2, C3, signal at ~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the C7-bridge proton that is *anti* to the double bond. A strong NOE is expected between these protons.\n\n*   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is pointing \"away\" from the C7 bridge.\n    *   In this conformation, the anhydride methine protons (~3.5 ppm) are far from both C7-bridge protons. Therefore, the corresponding NOE cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n*   This analysis directly matches the experimental observation. The distinguishing cross-peak connects the anhydride protons with one of the C7-bridge protons.\n\n**5. Match the Analysis to the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on our analysis:\n*   The resonances involved are:\n    1.  The anhydride methine protons: a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    2.  One of the C7-bridge protons: a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n*   Now check the options:\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: (Bridgehead Me <-> Vinylic Me). These are far apart.\n    B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: (Vinylic Me <-> Anhydride H). This interaction is strong in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) one. This contradicts the data.\n    C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: (Bridgehead Me <-> Bridge H). This interaction is likely present in both isomers and is not the unique distinguishing feature.\n    D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: (Bridge H <-> Anhydride H). This perfectly matches our finding. This NOE is strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid anhydride derived from a *cis*-alkene. Its ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl). This perfectly matches the spectral data for **maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃)**. The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry, giving a singlet at ~7 ppm. The two alkene carbons are equivalent (~137 ppm), and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent (~165 ppm).\n    *   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄)**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4) and methyl groups attached to each of these four carbons. The C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic product.\n    *   The problem states that two products, a major and a minor one, are formed. In Diels-Alder reactions, this typically corresponds to the formation of *endo* and *exo* stereoisomers. According to the endo rule, the *endo* adduct is usually the kinetically favored (major) product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structures and NMR Signals:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between these two reactants forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   The CH₂ group of the cyclopentadiene becomes the one-carbon bridge (C7) of the bicyclic system.\n    *   The four methyl groups from the diene are now located at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and the vinylic positions (C2, C3) of the new product.\n    *   The anhydride moiety is fused to carbons C5 and C6. The two protons originally on the maleic anhydride are now on C5 and C6.\n    *   Both the *endo* and *exo* products possess a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2=C3 bond, the C7 bridge, and the anhydride group. This symmetry has important consequences for the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n        *   The two bridgehead methyl groups (at C1 and C4) are equivalent and will appear as a single 6H singlet. These are on sp³ carbons and would be upfield, around **~1 ppm**. Let's call them **Me_b**.\n        *   The two vinylic methyl groups (at C2 and C3) are equivalent and will appear as a single 6H singlet. These are on sp² carbons and would be more downfield, around **~1.7 ppm**. Let's call them **Me_v**.\n        *   The two protons on the anhydride-fused part (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. They are not coupled to adjacent protons (C1 and C4 have methyl groups, not protons). They will appear as a 2H singlet. Being adjacent to the electron-withdrawing anhydride group, they will be significantly downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**. Let's call them **H5/H6**.\n        *   The two protons on the C7 bridge (H7) are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the C2=C3 double bond, one is *anti*). They will appear as two distinct signals, likely two 1H doublets due to geminal coupling. They are on a saturated carbon, so their chemical shifts would be in the aliphatic region, plausibly around **~1.5 ppm** for one of them. Let's call them **H7_syn** and **H7_anti**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Data to Distinguish Isomers:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between nuclei that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\"\n    *   Major product = *endo* adduct.\n    *   Minor product = *exo* adduct.\n    *   We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n5.  **Compare Spatial Proximities in *Endo* and *Exo* Adducts:**\n    *   ***Endo* Adduct:** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C2=C3 double bond. The protons H5 and H6 are in the *exo* position, meaning they point away from the double bond and towards the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the *exo*-H5/H6 protons are close to the *anti*-H7 proton (the one on the C7 bridge that also points away from the double bond).\n    *   ***Exo* Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge, pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond. The protons H5 and H6 are in the *endo* position, pointing \"under\" the C1-C6/C4-C5 bonds towards the C2=C3 double bond. In this orientation, H5/H6 are now far from the *anti*-H7 proton but are close to the *syn*-H7 proton and the vinylic methyls (Me_v).\n\n    **Conclusion:** The key differentiating NOE is the one between **H5/H6** and the ***anti*-H7 proton**. This NOE will be strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent or very weak in the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n6.  **Match the Finding to the Answer Choices:**\n    *   The interacting protons are H5/H6 and one of the H7 protons (specifically H7_anti).\n    *   The resonance for H5/H6 is the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   The resonance for one of the H7 protons is a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n\n    Let's check the options:\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_b) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_v): An NOE between these is expected in both isomers.\n    B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_v) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H5/H6): An NOE is expected for the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) one.\n    C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_b) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H7 proton): An NOE is plausible in both isomers between Me_b and H7_anti.\n    D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H7 proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H5/H6): This corresponds to the H7_anti to H5/H6 interaction that is uniquely strong in the *endo* (major) product.\n\nThis perfectly matches our analysis.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the reaction type.**\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is given: ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   Maleic acid is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Its dehydration yields maleic anhydride.\n    *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃). Due to the molecule's symmetry (a C₂v point group), the two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, and the two alkene carbons are equivalent, as are the two carbonyl carbons.\n    *   ¹H NMR: The two equivalent vinyl protons would give a single peak. Being on a double bond conjugated to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, their chemical shift would be significantly downfield, around 7 ppm. This matches the data.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: We expect two signals. One for the two equivalent vinyl carbons (C=C) and one for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). Alkene carbons are typically 100-150 ppm (137 ppm fits well), and carbonyl carbons are 160-200 ppm (165 ppm fits well).\n    *   Conclusion: The dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene (C₉H₁₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure and stereochemistry of the products.**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction between maleic anhydride and the substituted cyclopentadiene will form a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system with an anhydride ring fused to it.\n*   The molecular formula of the product would be C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride) + C₉H₁₄ (diene) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem, confirming our structural assignment.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two main stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The **Endo Rule** states that for kinetically controlled reactions (which are typical for Diels-Alder), the *endo* product is favored. In the *endo* product, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed bicyclic system, which is the C=C double bond in this case. In simpler terms, the anhydride is tucked \"underneath\" the new double bond.\n    *   The *exo* product is typically the thermodynamically more stable but kinetically disfavored product.\n    *   Therefore, it is standard to assume: **Major Product = Endo isomer** and **Minor Product = Exo isomer**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the expected NOESY correlations for the Endo and Exo isomers.**\n*   The Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) is a through-space interaction observed between protons that are physically close to each other (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak in a 2D NOESY spectrum indicates such proximity.\n*   The question describes a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**. We must find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   Let's identify the key proton groups in the product and estimate their chemical shifts:\n    *   **Ha:** The two protons on the anhydride part of the structure. They are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry in the product. They are alpha to carbonyl groups and part of a strained ring, so they will be deshielded. A reasonable estimate is ~3-4 ppm. The `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` is a perfect match for these protons.\n    *   **Mv (Vinyl methyls):** The two methyl groups on the C=C double bond (from C2 and C3 of the diene). They are equivalent by symmetry. Their protons (6H total) will appear as a singlet. Vinylic methyls typically resonate around 1.5-2.0 ppm. The `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm` is a good assignment.\n    *   **Mb (Bridgehead methyls):** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (from C1 and C4 of the diene). They are also equivalent by symmetry. As methyls on saturated carbons, they will be the most shielded. The `6H singlet at ~1 ppm` fits well.\n    *   **H-bridge:** The two protons on the C7 methylene bridge (from C5 of the diene). These two protons (`syn` and `anti` to the double bond) are diastereotopic and should have different chemical shifts and couple to each other. The `1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm` corresponds to one of these bridge protons.\n\n*   **Spatial relationships:**\n    *   **In the Endo (major) product:** The anhydride ring (with Ha protons) is tucked underneath the C2=C3 double bond. This brings the **Ha** protons close to the **Mv** (vinyl methyl) groups. The Ha protons are also close to the *syn*-proton of the C7 bridge.\n    *   **In the Exo (minor) product:** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond. The **Ha** protons are now far from the **Mv** groups and the *syn*-proton of the C7 bridge. Instead, they are closer to the bridgehead methyl groups (Mb).\n\n*   **Conclusion:** A NOESY cross-peak between **Ha** and **Mv** is expected to be **strong in the endo isomer** and **absent in the exo isomer**. This exactly matches the description in the problem.\n\n**Step 4: Match the conclusion with the given options.**\n*   We need the cross-peak connecting the resonances for **Ha** and **Mv**.\n*   Based on our assignments:\n    *   Resonance for **Ha** is the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`.\n    *   Resonance for **Mv** is the `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm`.\n*   This corresponds to the pair described in option C.\n\nLet's check the other options:\n*   A) `Mb (~1 ppm)` and `Mv (~1.7 ppm)`: These groups are not particularly close in either isomer.\n*   B) `H-bridge (~1.5 ppm)` and `Ha (~3.5 ppm)`: This interaction (specifically with the *syn*-bridge proton) is also expected in the endo isomer but not the exo. However, the interaction between Ha and Mv (Option C) is the most direct consequence of the secondary orbital interactions that define the endo selectivity of the Diels-Alder reaction, making it the most characteristic cross-peak.\n*   D) `Mb (~1 ppm)` and `H-bridge (~1.5 ppm)`: An NOE between a bridgehead methyl and a C7 proton might exist, but it would not be the key differentiating peak between the endo and exo isomers in the same way as those involving the mobile anhydride ring protons.\n\nTherefore, the most logical and chemically significant cross-peak that distinguishes the major (endo) from the minor (exo) product is the one between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl groups.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants.**\n    *   **The Dienophile**: We are given a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in the ¹H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in the ¹³C NMR.\n        *   A single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm suggests two equivalent vinylic protons (CH=CH) in a symmetrical molecule. The shift is in the alkene/aromatic region.\n        *   Two ¹³C NMR peaks suggest only two types of carbons. A symmetrical structure would have two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and two equivalent vinylic carbons (C=CH). The chemical shifts of 137 ppm (vinylic C) and 165 ppm (anhydride carbonyl C) are highly characteristic.\n        *   The only molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**, formed from the dehydration of *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid).\n        *   The molecular formula for maleic anhydride is **C₄H₂O₃**.\n\n    *   **The Diene**: The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1,3 and methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. The 5th position is a CH₂ group.\n        *   Let's determine its molecular formula. Cyclopentadiene is C₅H₆. We replace the four vinylic hydrogens on C1, C2, C3, and C4 with four methyl groups.\n        *   Formula = C₅H₂(CH₃)₄ = C₅H₂ + C₄H₁₂ = **C₉H₁₄**.\n\n2.  **Verify the Product's Molecular Formula.**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition, a [4+2] reaction. The formula of the product is the sum of the formulas of the reactants.\n    *   Product Formula = C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**.\n    *   This matches the molecular formula given in the problem, confirming our identification of the reactants.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products.**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride will form a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   The reaction yields two products, a major and a minor one. These correspond to the *endo* and *exo* stereoisomers.\n    *   According to the **Alder endo rule**, for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* adduct is the major product. The *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n        *   **Endo adduct (Major Product)**: The bulky part of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is oriented *syn* (on the same side as) the C7-CH₂ bridge. This places the two hydrogens on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) in an *exo* position relative to the bicyclic system.\n        *   **Exo adduct (Minor Product)**: The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side of) the C7-CH₂ bridge. This places the H_anhydride protons in an *endo* position.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Expected NMR Signals.**\n    *   Due to a plane of symmetry in both the *endo* and *exo* products, we expect the following signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n        *   **A 2H singlet for the anhydride protons (H_anhydride)**. These are methine protons (CH) alpha to two carbonyl groups, so they will be significantly deshielded. The value of **~3.5 ppm** is a reasonable estimate.\n        *   **Two 6H singlets for the methyl groups**. There are two bridgehead methyls (on sp³ carbons) and two vinylic methyls (on sp² carbons of the double bond). They are inequivalent. Vinylic methyls are typically downfield from alkyl methyls.\n            *   Vinylic methyls (**Me_vinyl**): **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**.\n            *   Bridgehead methyls (**Me_bridgehead**): **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet)**.\n        *   **Two 1H signals for the C7 bridge protons**. These two protons (H_syn and H_anti) are diastereotopic and will couple to each other, likely forming a pair of doublets (an AB system). A chemical shift of **~1.5 ppm** for one of them is reasonable.\n\n5.  **Use NOESY to Differentiate Isomers.**\n    *   A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two sets of protons are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. We need to find a proton-proton distance that is short in the *endo* adduct but long in the *exo* adduct.\n    *   Let's analyze the spatial relationships for each option based on the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) structures. The key is the position of the H_anhydride protons.\n        *   **Major (*endo*) product**: H_anhydride are in the *exo* position (pointing \"outward\" and away from the C7 bridge).\n        *   **Minor (*exo*) product**: H_anhydride are in the *endo* position (pointing \"inward\" into the molecular cage, toward the C7 bridge).\n\n    *   **Evaluation of the Options:**\n        *   **A) Me_bridgehead (~1.0 ppm) and Me_vinyl (~1.7 ppm):** The distance between these groups is fixed by the rigid bicyclic skeleton and should be very similar in both *endo* and *exo* isomers. This cannot be the distinguishing cross-peak.\n        *   **B) Me_bridgehead (~1.0 ppm) and H_bridge (~1.5 ppm):** The bridgehead methyls are adjacent to the C7 bridge. Their distance to the C7 protons is short and similar in both isomers. Not a distinguishing feature.\n        *   **C) Me_vinyl (~1.7 ppm) and H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm):**\n            *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the H_anhydride protons are in the *exo* position. This points them towards the C5=C6 double bond bridge where the Me_vinyl groups are located. They are relatively close in space. **A NOESY cross-peak is expected.**\n            *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the H_anhydride protons are in the *endo* position, pointing into the cage and away from the Me_vinyl groups. They are far apart. **A NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak.**\n            *   This scenario perfectly matches the experimental observation given in the question.\n        *   **D) H_bridge (~1.5 ppm) and H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm):**\n            *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, H_anhydride are *exo* and thus far from the C7 bridge protons. **No NOE expected.**\n            *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, H_anhydride are *endo* and point directly at the C7 bridge. They are very close to the *syn*-C7 proton. **Strong NOE expected.**\n            *   This is the opposite of the experimental observation.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    The cross-peak that is present in the major product (endo) and absent in the minor product (exo) is between the vinylic methyl protons (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet) and the anhydride methine protons (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic acid to anhydride**: The problem describes the dehydration of a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid to an anhydride. The anhydride's spectral data (1H NMR: 7 ppm singlet; 13C NMR: 137, 165 ppm) are highly characteristic of maleic anhydride.\n        *   Maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid) dehydrates to maleic anhydride.\n        *   **Symmetry**: Maleic anhydride is a symmetrical molecule (C2v). This explains the single peak in the 1H NMR for the two equivalent vinylic protons (Ha=Hb). A chemical shift of ~7 ppm is appropriate for these protons.\n        *   **Symmetry**: It also explains the two peaks in the 13C NMR: one for the two equivalent vinylic carbons (C=C, ~137 ppm) and one for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O, ~165 ppm).\n        *   **Conclusion**: The dienophile in the reaction is maleic anhydride (C4H2O3).\n\n    *   **Diene**: The diene is explicitly named as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n        *   This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 & 3.\n        *   Methyl groups are attached to all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4).\n        *   The remaining carbon of the ring is a CH2 group (at C5).\n        *   The molecular formula is C9H14.\n        *   This diene is locked in a *cisoid* conformation, making it highly reactive in Diels-Alder reactions.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Let's check the molecular formula: C9H14 (diene) + C4H2O3 (dienophile) → C13H16O3. This matches the formula given for the products.\n    *   Like most Diels-Alder reactions, this one can form two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct. The problem states that two products (major and minor) are formed, which corresponds to these two isomers.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and Major/Minor Products:**\n    *   **Endo Rule**: Diels-Alder reactions are often under kinetic control, favoring the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene and the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile.\n    *   **Steric Effects**: However, this rule can be overridden by steric hindrance. In this case, the diene is heavily substituted with four methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C2 and C3 positions will cause a severe steric clash with the approaching maleic anhydride in the *endo* transition state.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The *exo* transition state is much less sterically hindered. Therefore, the *exo* adduct will be the major product, and the *endo* adduct will be the minor product.\n\n4.  **Relate Stereochemistry to NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY detects protons that are close in space (< 5Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n    *   The question states a unique cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor one. This difference must arise from the different 3D structures of the *exo* (major) and *endo* (minor) isomers.\n\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Major Product)**:\n        *   The anhydride ring is oriented *away* from the C=C double bond of the norbornene system (i.e., *syn* to the C7 bridge).\n        *   This places the methine protons on the anhydride ring (let's call them H-5 and H-6) in an *endo* orientation relative to the norbornene skeleton, tucking them under the C=C double bond.\n        *   Therefore, in the *exo* adduct, H-5 and H-6 are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups (at C2 and C3). **An NOE is expected between {H-5, H-6} and {vinylic methyls}.**\n\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Minor Product)**:\n        *   The anhydride ring is oriented *towards* the C=C double bond.\n        *   This places the methine protons H-5 and H-6 in an *exo* orientation, pointing away from the C=C double bond and towards the C7 methylene bridge.\n        *   Therefore, in the *endo* adduct, H-5 and H-6 are far from the vinylic methyls but are close to the C7 bridge protons. An NOE would be expected between {H-5, H-6} and the {C7 protons}.\n\n    *   **The Distinguishing NOE**: The NOE between the anhydride methine protons {H-5, H-6} and the vinylic methyls {Me-2, Me-3} is present in the major (*exo*) product and absent in the minor (*endo*) product. This is the cross-peak described in the question.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Identify the Correct Option:**\n    *   The product molecule is highly symmetrical (possesses a plane of symmetry), simplifying the NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Vinylic methyls {Me-2, Me-3}**: These two equivalent methyl groups are attached to a double bond. Their signal will be a **6H singlet at ~1.6-1.8 ppm**. This matches the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** in the options.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyls {Me-1, Me-4}**: These two equivalent methyl groups are on saturated, bridgehead carbons. They are relatively shielded. Their signal will be a **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Anhydride methine protons {H-5, H-6}**: These two equivalent protons are on carbons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing anhydride group. They will be significantly deshielded. Their signal will be a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **C7 Methylene Protons**: These two protons are on the CH2 bridge, typically resonating around **1.5 ppm**.\n\n    *   The cross-peak in the major product connects the anhydride methine protons {H-5, H-6} and the vinylic methyls {Me-2, Me-3}.\n    *   Based on our assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\n6.  **Match with Provided Options:**\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - **This matches our conclusion.**\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic Me) - These are too far apart for a strong NOE.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge H) - Possible but not the distinguishing NOE between major/minor.\n    *   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge H) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride H) - This NOE is expected for the minor (*endo*) product, not the major (*exo*) one.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
