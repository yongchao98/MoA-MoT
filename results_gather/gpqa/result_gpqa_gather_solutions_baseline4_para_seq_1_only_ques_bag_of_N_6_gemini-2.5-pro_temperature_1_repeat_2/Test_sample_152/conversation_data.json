In the presence of a base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The p-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt <=> [CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻ Na⁺ + EtOH`\n    2.  **Michael Addition (Nucleophilic Attack):** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n        `[CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻ + p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃ → (MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃`\n    3.  **Protonation:** The resulting enolate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n        `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃ + EtOH → (MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n*   **Product A Identification:**\n    *   The structure of the product is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this compound as a tricarboxylate derivative of propane, we can consider the three-carbon chain formed by the malonate carbon, the β-carbon, and the α-carbon of the original acrylate.\n        *   Let C1 be the carbon from the malonate, which is attached to two `-COOCH₃` groups.\n        *   Let C2 be the β-carbon, which is attached to the `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   Let C3 be the α-carbon, which is now part of a `-CH₂-COOCH₃` moiety.\n    *   The structure can be seen as `(MeOOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)(p-tolyl)-CH₂(3)COOCH₃`.\n    *   This is an ester of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid. The substituent is a `p-tolyl` group at position 2.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are excellent Michael donors. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n*   **Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    1.  **Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and results in an iminium ion intermediate.\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The reaction mixture is treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone).\n*   **Product B Identification:**\n    *   The initial addition places the `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group onto the cyclohexene ring at the position that was β to the nitrogen.\n    *   After hydrolysis, the enamine part reverts to a cyclohexanone. The substituent is at the α-position (C2) relative to the new carbonyl group.\n    *   The product structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at C2.\n    *   To name the product, we can consider it a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is the four-carbon nitrile.\n        *   `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`\n    *   The substituent is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group attached to C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is generally the minor product compared to the more stable keto form after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (commonly known as methyl vinyl ketone or MVK), `CH₂=CH-COCH₃`.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Reactant C.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   This is a Michael addition reaction where reactant C acts as the nucleophile. The reaction is done in the presence of base (KOH).\n    *   The product is formed by adding a fragment from the Michael acceptor to the Michael donor. The fragment added from MVK (`CH₂=CH-COCH₃`) to the donor is `-CH₂-CH₂-COCH₃`, which is the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   The product structure shows that this `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to C2 of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n    *   This implies that the Michael donor (reactant C) must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The proton at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is very acidic because it's located between two carbonyl groups. The base (KOH) deprotonates this carbon to form a highly stabilized enolate, which then attacks the MVK.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis set of reactants and products corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the three reactions to determine the reactants and major final products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of the strong base sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-hydrogen (between the two carbonyl groups) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a conjugate addition.\n    1.  `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃  →  p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃`\n    2.  The resulting enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to give the final neutral product.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃ + EtOH  →  p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n*   **Product A Structure:** The final product is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n*   **Product A Name:** To name this compound using the system in the options, we identify a propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid core. The structure is the trimethyl ester of 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid. Therefore, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 of the original cyclohexanone ring). This reaction is a Stork enamine alkylation, a type of Michael addition.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a carbanion stabilized by the nitrile group.\n    2.  The subsequent acidic workup (`H₃O⁺`) has two functions: it hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (regenerating the ketone) and protonates the carbanion.\n*   **Product B Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2) with the group derived from but-2-enenitrile. The added group is `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`. So the product is 2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Product B Name:** This molecule is named as a substituted butanenitrile. The butanenitrile chain is `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-`. The substituent on C3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group. Thus, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the more stable tautomer and is considered the major final product.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a reverse problem. We are given the product and one reactant (the Michael acceptor) and need to find the other reactant (the Michael donor, C).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (also known as methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n*   **Analysis:** In a Michael addition, a nucleophile adds to the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated system. For MVK, the nucleophile adds to the terminal `CH₂` group.\n    `Nu⁻ + CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃ → Nu-CH₂-⁻CH-C(=O)CH₃`\n    After protonation, this gives `Nu-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`.\n*   **Identifying Reactant C:** The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The substituent at the C2 position is the `-(3-oxobutyl)` group, which is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`. This matches the fragment added from MVK. Therefore, the nucleophile (`Nu⁻`) must be the enolate of the remaining part of the molecule, which is the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic C2 proton of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Reactant C:** The starting material C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   Product A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   Product B is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)\n*   B) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (**Correct**)\n*   C) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect A, B, and C)\n*   D) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect A and B)\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), is strong enough to deprotonate the acidic α-carbon (the CH₂ group flanked by two ester groups), forming a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The electrophilic site for Michael addition is the β-carbon. The carbonyl carbon is C=O, the adjacent carbon is α, and the next one is β. So, the structure is `p-tolyl-CβH=CαH-COOCH₃`.\n3.  **The Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons from the C=C bond shift to form an enolate intermediate, which is then protonated by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent.\n    *   **Attack:** `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon.\n    *   **Intermediate Formation & Protonation:** `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - C⁻H-COOCH₃` is formed, which is quickly protonated by EtOH to give `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n4.  **Name the Product (A):** The product structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this using the options' systematic nomenclature, we can consider it a derivative of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid, which has the backbone `(HOOC)₂CH-CH₂-CH₂COOH`.\n    *   Our product has a `p-tolyl` group substituting a hydrogen on the central carbon (C2).\n    *   So, the parent acid is 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid.\n    *   The final product is the trimethyl ester of this acid.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, which serves as a nucleophile. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon relative to the nitrogen atom (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This is part of the Stork enamine synthesis.\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The electrophilic β-carbon is the one attached to the methyl group: `CH₃-CβH=CαH-CN`.\n3.  **The Reaction:** The nucleophilic carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate. The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) first protonates the intermediate anion and then hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone.\n    *   **Attack & Intermediate:** The enamine attacks the nitrile, forming a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone) and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   **Hydrolysis:** The `H₃O⁺` workup converts the enamine functionality back to a carbonyl group.\n4.  **Identify the Product (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a substituent at the C2 position (α to the carbonyl). The substituent is derived from the but-2-enenitrile acceptor: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The full structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at position 2.\n    *   Naming this compound as a substituted butanenitrile: The main chain is the four-carbon nitrile. There is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group attached to carbon 3 of the nitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Acceptor (Retro-Michael Reaction):** This is a retrosynthesis problem. We need to identify reactant C.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`. The β-carbon is the `CH₂` group.\n2.  **Identify the Bond Formed:** The Michael addition forms a bond between the nucleophile and the β-carbon of the acceptor. In the product, the `(3-oxobutyl)` group, `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`, comes from MVK. The bond must have formed at the terminal `CH₂` of this group.\n3.  **Identify the Michael Donor (C):** The rest of the molecule must have been the nucleophile (Michael donor). This is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety, connected at C2.\n    *   Cyclohexane-1,3-dione has highly acidic protons on the C2 carbon, as this carbon is located between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   The base, KOH, will deprotonate C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to form a stable enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as the nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Therefore, reactant **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon (the carbon atom of the double bond further from the ester group) is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Mechanism (Conjugate Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to form another enolate intermediate.\n    *   This second enolate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (A):**\n    The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    The resulting structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n\n4.  **Naming Product A:**\n    To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional groups (the three methyl ester groups). This is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n    *   The propane chain is `C1 - C2 - C3`.\n    *   We number the chain to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the malonate end:\n        *   C1 has two `-COOCH₃` groups.\n        *   C2 has a `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   C3 has one `-COOCH₃` group (it's attached to C3 via a CH₂).\n    Let's re-verify the structure and name. The structure is `(MeOOC)₂C¹H-C²H(p-tolyl)-C³H₂-COOMe`.\n    The IUPAC name is based on a propane main chain with three carboxylate groups.\n    The propane chain is `C¹-C²-C³`. The substituents are attached as follows: `(MeOOC)₂-CH¹ - CH²(p-tolyl) - CH₂³-COOMe`.\n    Numbering from the right side gives the principal groups at positions 1, 3, 3, and the p-tolyl at 2. Numbering from the left gives the principal groups at 1,1,3 and the p-tolyl at 2. The set (1,1,3) is lower than (1,3,3).\n    So, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nitrogen analogs of enols and are excellent nucleophiles. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the original enone system, which is C2 of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium ion.\n    *   The reaction is worked up with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). The acid hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Product Structure (B):**\n    *   A cyclohexanone ring is regenerated.\n    *   A new substituent is attached at the C2 position (the α-carbon to the carbonyl).\n    *   The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group at C2.\n\n4.  **Naming Product B:**\n    We can name this compound in two ways, but we will choose the one presented in the options. Naming the butanenitrile as the parent chain:\n    *   The parent chain is butanenitrile: `NC-C¹H₂-C²H₂-C³H-C⁴H₃`.\n    *   The substituent is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   Looking at our product structure, `(2-oxocyclohexyl)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`, the substituent is attached to C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, more stable tautomer compared to the enol form.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants from Product (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Unknown Reactant (Michael Donor):** C.\n\n2.  **Analysis:**\n    *   A Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The `(3-oxobutyl)` group in the product, `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, comes from MVK (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`) after it has been attacked at its β-carbon (`CH₂=`) and protonated.\n    *   This means the bond was formed between the C2 of the dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of the remaining part of the molecule, which is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n\n3.  **Verifying the Forward Reaction:**\n    *   Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic methylene protons at C2 (located between two carbonyls) to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    *   This enolate attacks the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Subsequent protonation yields the product, `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This confirms C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of reactants and products matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Step 1: Formation of the Nucleophile (Michael Donor).**\n    Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate. This carbon is particularly acidic because its conjugate base (the enolate) is stabilized by resonance across two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    `CH2(COOMe)2 + NaOEt <=> [Na]⁺[⁻CH(COOMe)2] + EtOH`\n    The nucleophile is the malonate enolate, `⁻CH(COOMe)2`.\n*   **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack (Michael Addition).**\n    The Michael acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`. The nucleophile attacks the electrophilic β-carbon.\n    The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon, and the π electrons shift to form a new enolate intermediate.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe + ⁻CH(COOMe)2 → p-Tolyl-CH(β)(CH(COOMe)2)-C⁻H(α)-COOMe`\n*   **Step 3: Protonation.**\n    The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final neutral product (A).\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)2)-C⁻H-COOMe + EtOH → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)2)-CH2-COOMe + EtO⁻`\n*   **Step 4: Naming the Product (A).**\n    The structure of the product is `(MeOOC)2CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH2-COOMe`.\n    Let's analyze the names provided in the options, which use a common (non-systematic IUPAC) \"propane-tricarboxylate\" nomenclature.\n    -   `propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` refers to a three-carbon chain with two carboxylate groups on C1 and one on C3: `(MeOOC)2CH-CH2-CH2-COOMe`.\n    -   Placing a `p-tolyl` group at the C2 position gives `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    -   The structure for this name is `(MeOOC)2CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH2-COOMe`.\n    -   This structure exactly matches the product we derived from the reaction mechanism.\n    Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, followed by workup with MeOH and H3O⁺.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which involves a Michael addition of an enamine followed by hydrolysis.\n*   **Step 1: Formation and Reaction of the Nucleophile.**\n    1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral but strongly nucleophilic at their β-carbon (the carbon that was the α-carbon of the original ketone). This enamine acts as the Michael donor.\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition.**\n    The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`). The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n*   **Step 3: Protonation and Hydrolysis.**\n    The intermediate is protonated and then hydrolyzed by the acidic workup (H3O⁺). Hydrolysis of the iminium ion regenerates the ketone (cyclohexanone). The overall result is the addition of the butenenitrile-derived group to the α-carbon of cyclohexanone.\n*   **Step 4: Identifying the Product (B).**\n    -   The bond forms between the α-carbon of cyclohexanone (C2) and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    -   The fragment from but-2-enenitrile, after addition and protonation, is `-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n    -   This group is attached to C2 of the cyclohexanone ring.\n    -   The final product is a substituted cyclohexanone. To name it, we can treat the butanenitrile as the parent chain.\n    -   Parent chain: butanenitrile (`NC-C1-C2-C3-C4`).\n    -   The structure is `NC-CH2-CH(cyclohexanone)-CH3`. Numbering from the nitrile group (`CN` is C1), the substituent is at C3. The substituent is the `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    -   Thus, the product name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The acidic workup ensures the final product is the keto form, not the enol form (`3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`).\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** An unknown compound C and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition, but we need to identify one of the starting materials (a retro-synthesis problem).\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure.**\n    The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    -   The `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` is the six-membered ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3.\n    -   The `(3-oxobutyl)` group has the structure `-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    -   This group is attached at the C2 position of the dione ring, which is the acidic carbon located between the two carbonyls.\n*   **Step 2: Deconstruct the Michael Addition.**\n    A Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    -   The acceptor is given as but-3-en-2-one (MVK): `CH2(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    -   After the reaction, this fragment becomes `-CH2(β)-CH2(α)-C(=O)-CH3`, which is precisely the `(3-oxobutyl)` group in the product.\n    -   This means the bond was formed between the C2 of the donor ring and the β-carbon (CH2) of MVK.\n*   **Step 3: Identify Reactant C.**\n    The donor must be the molecule that provides the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` part. The reaction is carried out in base (KOH), which deprotonates the most acidic proton. The C2 proton of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is highly acidic and readily forms an enolate, which is a potent Michael donor.\n    Therefore, reactant **C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A** is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   **B** is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   **C** is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nThis set of reactants and products corresponds exactly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(CO₂Me)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, ⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-CO₂Me.\n*   **Reaction:** The nucleophilic enolate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a conjugate (or 1,4-) addition.\n    1.  **Attack:** The ⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂ carbanion attacks the β-carbon. The π electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and the π electrons of the C=O bond shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n        `p-Tolyl-CH(β)(CH(CO₂Me)₂) - CH(α)=C(O⁻)OMe`\n    2.  **Protonation:** This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final, stable product.\n        `p-Tolyl-CH(β)(CH(CO₂Me)₂) - CH₂(α)-CO₂Me`\n*   **Product A Naming:** Let's determine the IUPAC name for the product: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂) - CH₂-CO₂Me`.\n    We can identify a three-carbon chain as the main backbone, with carboxylate groups attached.\n    ` (MeO₂C)CH₂ - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH(CO₂Me)₂ `\n    Let's number this propane chain: `(MeO₂C)C³H₂ - C²H(p-Tolyl) - C¹H(CO₂Me)₂`\n    - The main chain is propane.\n    - There are three methyl carboxylate groups, making it a `trimethyl ... tricarboxylate`.\n    - The carboxylate groups are at positions 1, 1, and 3. So it is a `propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    - There is a p-tolyl substituent at position 2.\n    - The full name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, a nitrogen analog of an enol. Enamines are excellent nucleophiles at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This type of Michael addition is known as the Stork enamine alkylation.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN.\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  **Attack:** The nucleophilic C2 of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an iminium ion intermediate.\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (a ketone) at C1 of the cyclohexane ring. The piperidine is removed.\n*   **Product B:** The resulting product is a cyclohexanone ring with a substituent at the C2 position. The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`.\n    The structure is `2-(-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN)cyclohexan-1-one`.\n*   **Product B Naming:** According to IUPAC rules, the nitrile group (CN) has higher priority than the ketone. Therefore, the main chain is butanenitrile.\n    `CN¹-C²H₂-C³H(substituent)-C⁴H₃`\n    The substituent at C3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    The full name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is thermodynamically more stable than the enol form, so it is the major final product.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   This is a \"retrosynthesis\" problem where we need to identify the starting material C.\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** In a Michael addition, the donor adds to the β-carbon of the acceptor. After the addition and protonation, the MVK molecule becomes the `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-CO-CH₃` group, which is the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n*   The product shows that this `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to the C2 position of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring. The C-C bond was formed between C2 of the ring and the β-carbon of MVK.\n*   Therefore, the Michael donor (reactant C) must have been **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic C2 position (located between two carbonyls) to generate the nucleophilic enolate that initiates the attack on MVK.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of reactants and products matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants**: Dimethyl malonate (`CH₂(COOMe)₂`) + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOMe`)\n*   **Reagents**: NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) as a base, EtOH (ethanol) as a solvent.\n*   **Type of Reaction**: Michael Addition.\n\n1.  **Formation of Nucleophile (Michael Donor)**: The base, sodium ethoxide (EtO⁻), is strong enough to deprotonate the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, which is highly acidic due to the two adjacent ester groups. This forms a resonance-stabilized enolate ion.\n    `CH₂(COOMe)₂ + NaOEt ⇌ Na⁺ ⁻CH(COOMe)₂ + EtOH`\n\n2.  **Michael Addition**: The malonate enolate is a \"soft\" nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester (methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate). The α,β-unsaturated system is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`.\n    The nucleophile `⁻CH(COOMe)₂` attacks the β-carbon. This breaks the C=C π-bond, and the electrons move to form a new enolate intermediate.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOMe + ⁻CH(COOMe)₂ → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) -⁻CH-COOMe`\n\n3.  **Protonation**: The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final neutral product.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) -⁻CH-COOMe + EtOH → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) -CH₂-COOMe + EtO⁻`\n\n4.  **Product A Structure**: The final product is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂COOMe`.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A**: The IUPAC name for this structure is `trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)butane-1,1,4-tricarboxylate`. However, this name is not present in the options. The options provide names based on a propane chain, which are not strictly correct according to IUPAC rules for this structure. Let's analyze the names given in the options later and proceed to the other reactions.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants**: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`)\n*   **Reagents**: MeOH (methanol) as solvent, followed by aqueous acid workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Type of Reaction**: Stork Enamine Alkylation (a variation of the Michael Addition).\n\n1.  **Nucleophile (Michael Donor)**: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C=C carbon not attached to nitrogen).\n\n2.  **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor)**: (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (`CH₃-CH=`) is the electrophilic site for Michael addition.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an iminium ion intermediate.\n\n4.  **Hydrolysis**: The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone). The nitrile group is stable to these conditions and remains.\n\n5.  **Product B Structure**: The reaction attaches the butanenitrile fragment to the α-carbon of the original cyclohexanone. The substituent is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`. The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with this substituent at the 2-position.\n\n6.  **Naming Product B**: The product is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. This matches the name for product B in options A and D. The names in options B and C describe an enol, which is not the major product after acidic workup. Thus, options B and C can be eliminated.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants**: Reactant C + but-3-en-2-one (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`, methyl vinyl ketone or MVK).\n*   **Reagents**: KOH (potassium hydroxide), H₂O.\n*   **Product**: 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Type of Reaction**: Michael Addition.\n\n1.  **Analyzing the Product**: The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` is the main ring system.\n    *   The `(3-oxobutyl)` group is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   This substituent is located at the C2 position of the dione ring.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthesis**: We can deduce the reactants by mentally reversing the Michael addition. The bond formed is between the nucleophilic carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The acceptor is MVK (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`). After addition, it becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` (3-oxobutyl) group.\n    *   This means the Michael donor must be the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic C2-proton (located between the two carbonyls) to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the MVK.\n\n3.  **Reactant C Identity**: Therefore, reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **Product B** is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. This eliminates options B and C.\n*   **Reactant C** is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This eliminates option D, which lists C as `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione` (an unstable tautomer not typically referred to as the starting material).\n\nThis leaves **Option A** as the only possible answer.\n\nLet's re-examine Product A's name in Option A: `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`. As determined earlier, this name corresponds to the structure `(MeOOC)CH₂-CH(p-tolyl)-CH(COOMe)₂`, which is not the direct product of the given reaction. There is an error in the name provided in the question's options. However, since the other parts of option A (Product B and Reactant C) are correct, we choose A as the best fit.\n\nFinal check of Option A:\n*   A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate (Incorrect name, but we proceed by elimination)\n*   B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile (Correct)\n*   C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Correct)\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n**Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n**Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH)\n**Reaction Type:** Michael Addition\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleophile (Michael Donor):** Sodium ethoxide is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate.

In the presence of a base (NaOEt), it gets deprotonated to form a nucleophilic enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The carbon atoms are numbered starting from the carbonyl group, so the structure is `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), removes an acidic α-proton from dimethyl malonate to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n    2.  The malonate enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the methyl acrylate derivative.\n    3.  A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. This creates a new enolate intermediate: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃`.\n    4.  This enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n*   **Product Structure (A):**\n    The final product has the structure `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Naming the Product:**\n    Let's analyze the names provided in the options. The IUPAC naming of this complex molecule can be tricky.\n    Let's analyze the name from option A: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n    *   The parent chain is propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. This corresponds to a propane chain (`C₃-C₂-C₁`) with carboxylate groups at C1 (two of them) and C3 (one of them).\n    *   The structure of the parent trimethyl ester is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-C₂H₂-C₃H₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   A `p-tolyl` group is placed at the C2 position.\n    *   This gives the structure: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    This structure matches the product derived from the reaction mechanism. Therefore, this name correctly identifies product A.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nitrogen analogs of enols and are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 position of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile, also known as crotononitrile, `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which proceeds via a Michael-type addition.\n    2.  The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    3.  This forms an iminium salt intermediate.\n    4.  The reaction mixture is then treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This workup step hydrolyzes the iminium salt back into a ketone. The enamine functionality essentially serves to activate the α-position of the original ketone (cyclohexanone) for nucleophilic attack.\n*   **Product Structure (B):**\n    The final product is a cyclohexanone ring where the α-carbon (C2) is substituted with the remnant of the Michael acceptor. The acceptor `CH₃-CH=CH-CN` becomes the group `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` upon addition.\n    The product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone: `2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexanone`.\n*   **Naming the Product:**\n    The product can be named as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is `butanenitrile`. A `2-oxocyclohexyl` group is attached to C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name in the options, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, describes the enol tautomer. Under acidic workup, the more stable keto form is the major product.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Reactant C (Michael Donor):** To be determined.\n    *   **Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Analysis (Retrosynthesis):**\n    1.  We need to identify the bond formed during the Michael addition. The acceptor, MVK, adds as a `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` group (a `3-oxobutyl` group).\n    2.  In the product, this `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to the C2 position of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n    3.  This means the nucleophile that attacked MVK was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    4.  The C2 position of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is flanked by two carbonyl groups, making the protons on this carbon particularly acidic (pKa ≈ 11). The base (KOH) easily deprotonates this position to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Reactant C Structure:**\n    Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThese three components match the descriptions in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH).\n*   **Type of Reaction:** Michael Addition.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂, has acidic α-protons (the CH₂ group is flanked by two electron-withdrawing ester groups). The strong base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `[CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻`. This is the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electron-deficient (electrophilic) due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Reaction Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The electron pair from the C=C double bond shifts to the α-carbon, and the C=O π-bond shifts to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate. This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH).\n\n    *   **Step 1 (Attack):** `[CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻` + `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃` → `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - [CH-COOCH₃]⁻`\n    *   **Step 2 (Protonation):** `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - [CH-COOCH₃]⁻` + EtOH → `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃` + EtO⁻\n\n4.  **Identify Product (A):** The final product is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    Let's name this structure according to the options provided. The name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" describes a propane backbone (C1-C2-C3) with two methoxycarbonyl groups at C1, one at C3, and a p-tolyl group at C2.\n    *   Let's draw this: `(COOCH₃)₂CH(1) - CH(2)(p-Tolyl) - CH₂(3)COOCH₃`.\n    *   This structure exactly matches the product we derived.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH) as solvent, followed by aqueous acid workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Type of Reaction:** Stork Enamine Alkylation (a type of Michael Addition).\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center.\n\n3.  **Reaction Mechanism:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate. The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group.\n\n    *   **Step 1 (Attack):** The enamine attacks the nitrile, forming a C-C bond between C2 of the cyclohexyl ring and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. An iminium ion is formed.\n    *   **Step 2 (Hydrolysis):** The H₃O⁺ hydrolyzes the iminium ion, converting it to a ketone (C=O) at the C1 position of the cyclohexane ring and releasing protonated piperidine.\n\n4.  **Identify Product (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2). The substituent is the remnant of the butenenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`.\n    *   The structure is 2-(1-cyanopropan-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's analyze the name given in the options: **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n    *   This name describes a butanenitrile parent chain: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`.\n    *   A \"2-oxocyclohexyl\" group is attached at position 3. This means a cyclohexanone ring is attached via its C2 position.\n    *   This name perfectly describes the derived product structure. The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is typically the minor product in aqueous acid.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C\n\n*   **Reactants:** C and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water (H₂O).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Type of Reaction:** Michael Addition (working backwards).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Michael Acceptor:**\n    *   The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The Michael acceptor is MVK, `CH₂=CH-C(O)CH₃`.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon of the acceptor. The `CH₂=CH-` part of MVK becomes `-CH₂-CH₂-` after addition and protonation.\n    *   The `3-oxobutyl` group in the product is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)CH₃`. This fragment clearly comes from MVK.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Reactant C):**\n    *   The `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to C2 of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system.\n    *   This implies that the nucleophile was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The starting material C must therefore be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic C2-proton (located between the two carbonyls) of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to form the nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks MVK. The other option, `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione`, is not the standard starting material.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of compounds corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (α,β-unsaturated compound):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, (p-CH₃C₆H₄)-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The p-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The β-carbon is the one bonded to the p-tolyl group. This is a conjugate addition (1,4-addition).\n    *   The attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. An intermediate enolate is formed.\n    *   Protonation of the intermediate enolate (at the α-carbon of the original acrylate) by the solvent (EtOH) yields the final product.\n\n3.  **Draw and Name the Product (A):**\n    *   The nucleophile `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` adds to the β-carbon of `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   The resulting structure is `(p-tolyl)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this molecule systematically (IUPAC), we can consider it a substituted propane chain with three trimethyl carboxylate groups. The main chain is propane.\n        *   `C1 - C2 - C3`\n        *   Let's place the substituents to get the lowest possible numbers. If we number from the `CH(COOCH₃)₂` end, we have: `(MeOOC)₂CH¹-CH²(p-tolyl)-CH₂³-COOMe`.\n        *   This gives us a propane backbone.\n        *   Two methoxycarbonyl groups at C1.\n        *   One p-tolyl group at C2.\n        *   One methoxycarbonyl group that is part of a -CH₂COOMe group attached to C2. This numbering is incorrect.\n    *   Let's try naming it based on the name provided in the options: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n        *   Propane backbone: C1-C2-C3.\n        *   -tricarboxylate at 1,1,3 means: C1 has two `-COOCH₃` groups, and C3 has one `-COOCH₃` group.\n        *   2-(p-tolyl) means a p-tolyl group is on C2.\n        *   The structure is: `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n    *   This structure matches the one derived from the reaction mechanism. Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a neutral, carbon-based nucleophile, analogous to an enolate. It is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nucleophilic carbon is the α-carbon of the enamine (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH=CH-CN.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   The final step involves hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). The acid hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Draw and Name the Product (B):**\n    *   The nucleophilic C2 of the enamine attacks the β-carbon (C3) of CH₃-CH=CH-CN.\n    *   A new bond forms between C2 of the cyclohexane ring and C3 of the butanenitrile chain. The substituent added to the ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`.\n    *   After hydrolysis, the enamine part (`C=N⁺<`) reverts to a ketone (`C=O`) at C1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN` group at position 2.\n    *   To name this molecule, we can consider it a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is butanenitrile (`N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H-C⁴H₃`).\n    *   The substituent on C3 is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    *   Thus, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.

This is the nucleophile.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH3`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon atom attached to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the methyl acrylate derivative.\n    *   The electrons from the C=C double bond shift to form another enolate intermediate, which is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to give the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Draw the Product Structure:**\n    *   The `CH(COOCH3)2` group (from the donor) forms a new bond with the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The original α-carbon of the acceptor gains a proton.\n    *   Donor fragment: `-CH(COOCH3)2`\n    *   Acceptor fragment: `p-Tolyl-CH(β)-CH(α)H-COOCH3`\n    *   Product (A): `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH2-COOCH3`\n\n4.  **Name the Product (A):**\n    *   We need to find the correct IUPAC name for the structure `(MeOOC)2CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH2-COOMe`.\n    *   Let's analyze the names given in the options.\n        *   `trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate`: This name implies the structure `p-Tolyl-CH2-CH(COOMe)-CH(COOMe)2`. This would result from an attack on the α-carbon, which is incorrect for a Michael addition.\n        *   `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`: This name implies a propane chain (C1-C2-C3). Carboxylate groups are at positions 1, 1, and 3. A p-tolyl group is at position 2. Let's build this structure: `(MeOOC)2CH(C1)-CH(p-Tolyl)(C2)-CH2(C3)-COOMe`. This structure matches the product derived from the Michael addition.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which is a variation of the Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor (as enamine):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the α-carbon.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile, `CH3-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion and a carbanion, which is protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n    *   Finally, the acidic workup (`H3O+`) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a ketone.\n\n3.  **Draw the Product Structure:**\n    *   The net result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The group added is derived from the acceptor, `CH3-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The new bond is between C2 of the ketone and Cβ of the nitrile. Cα of the nitrile gets a proton.\n    *   The added fragment is `-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with the `-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN` group attached at the C2 position.\n\n4.  **Name the Product (B):**\n    *   The structure is 2-(1-methyl-2-cyanoethyl)cyclohexanone.\n    *   Let's check the names in the options.\n        *   `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`: This is the enol tautomer of the product.\n        *   `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`: This names the compound by treating the butanenitrile as the parent chain. The substituent at position 3 is the (2-oxocyclohexyl) group. This accurately describes the keto form of the product.\n    *   The keto form is generally the more stable and major product after an acidic workup that hydrolyzes the intermediate.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where we need to find the Michael donor (reactant C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, `CH2=CH-CO-CH3`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Structures (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   The Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   Let's identify the fragment that came from the acceptor. The acceptor is `CH2(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH3`. After reaction, it becomes the `-CH2(β)-CH2(α)-CO-CH3` group, which is a `(3-oxobutyl)` group.\n    *   The product shows this `(3-oxobutyl)` group attached to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring system.\n    *   This means the bond was formed between C2 of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   Therefore, the donor must have been the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The starting material (C) that forms this enolate upon treatment with base (KOH) is the dione itself.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C:**\n    *   The methylene protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic because they are flanked by two carbonyl groups. They are readily removed by KOH to form the nucleophilic enolate required for the Michael addition.\n    *   The alternative option, `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione`, is the enol tautomer. While the enolate is the reactive species, the starting material is typically written as the diketone.\n    *   Therefore, **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nThese results correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   The Michael donor is the nucleophile. Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the mixture. The α-protons of dimethyl malonate (CH₂(COOCH₃)₂) are highly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. Thus, dimethyl malonate will be deprotonated to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`, which serves as the Michael donor.\n    *   The Michael acceptor is the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-COOCH₃`).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Enolate formation):** `NaOEt + CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ → ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ Na⁺ + EtOH`\n    *   **Step 2 (Nucleophilic attack):** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The double bond electrons shift to the α-carbon, and the carbonyl electrons shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n        `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + (p-tolyl)-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃ → (p-tolyl)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH⁻-COOCH₃`\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent, ethanol (EtOH), to yield the final neutral product (A).\n        `(p-tolyl)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH⁻-COOCH₃ + EtOH → (p-tolyl)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n\n3.  **Identify Product (A):**\n    *   The structure of product (A) is `(p-tolyl)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this compound using IUPAC rules, we identify the parent acid. The structure can be seen as a derivative of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid (`HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH(COOH)₂`) that is substituted with a p-tolyl group at the C2 position.\n    *   The structure is `CH₃OOC-CH₂-CH(p-tolyl)-CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   This reaction is a Stork enamine synthesis, a variation of the Michael reaction.\n    *   The Michael donor is the enamine, **1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine**, which is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral but highly nucleophilic at their α-carbon.\n    *   The Michael acceptor is the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, **(E)-but-2-enenitrile** (crotononitrile, `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Nucleophilic attack):** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms an iminium ion and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   **Step 2 (Protonation):** The carbanion is protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n    *   **Step 3 (Hydrolysis):** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone), regenerating the cyclohexanone ring and producing a protonated piperidine salt.\n\n3.  **Identify Product (B):**\n    *   The net result is the formation of a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone) and the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   The fragment from butenenitrile that gets attached to the ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   This group is attached to the α-carbon (C2) of cyclohexanone.\n    *   The final product (B) is 2-substituted cyclohexanone: `2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexan-1-one`.\n    *   To name this compound, we treat the nitrile as the principal functional group. The parent chain is butanenitrile. The (2-oxocyclohexyl) group is a substituent at the C3 position of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major stable product, not the enol tautomer.\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify the Knowns (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a retrosynthesis problem where we need to find the starting material C.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** C.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Product and Reverse the Reaction:**\n    *   The Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   Let's identify this bond in the product. The substituent `-(3-oxobutyl)` has the structure `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`. This group comes from MVK (`CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`). The bond is formed to the β-carbon.\n    *   The donor's nucleophilic carbon is the C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. This carbon is highly acidic as it is flanked by two carbonyl groups, making it an excellent Michael donor precursor.\n    *   To find reactant C, we mentally break the bond between the C2 of the ring and the `CH₂` of the side chain.\n    *   This disconnection gives us the acceptor (MVK) and the enolate of the donor C.\n    *   Protonating this enolate gives the neutral starting material C.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant (C):**\n    *   The enolate is the anion of cyclohexane-1,3-dione at the C2 position.\n    *   Therefore, the starting material C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH2(COOCH3)2`.

This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group) is the electrophilic site for conjugate addition.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, and the π-electrons from the C=O bond shift to the oxygen atom, forming an intermediate enolate.\n    *   This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) during workup to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Predict the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   A new C-C bond is formed between the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The structure is: `(CH3OOC)2CH–CH(p-tolyl)–CH2–COOCH3`.\n\n4.  **Name Product A:**\n    *   Let's analyze the structure to match it with the names provided in the options.

The p-tolyl group is at position 2 of the propane chain, and the three methyl carboxylate groups are at positions 1, 1, and 3.\n    *   This result eliminates options A and B.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nucleophiles, and the β-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring) is the nucleophilic center.

This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (the `CH` bonded to the methyl group) is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C2 of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium ion (after the electrons rearrange) and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion, which is quickly protonated.\n    *   The acidic workup (H3O+) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Predict the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   A new substituent is attached at the C2 position (α to the carbonyl).\n    *   The substituent is derived from the but-2-enenitrile.

The resulting proton is highly acidic because the negative charge on the conjugate base (the enolate) is stabilized by resonance across two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n        `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt → Na⁺ ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + EtOH`\n        The nucleophile is the malonate enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon atom of the C=C double bond that is further from the ester group) is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group. The structure is `p-tolyl-C³H=C²H-C¹(=O)OCH₃`. The β-carbon is C3.\n    3.  **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon (C3) of the acrylate. The π-electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon (C2), and the carbonyl π-electrons shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate. This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol) at the α-carbon to yield the final product.\n        *   **Attack:** `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`.\n        *   **Bond Formation:** A new C-C bond forms between the carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n        *   **Product Structure:** `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    4.  **Naming Product (A):** The product is a tri-ester.

Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C=C carbon not bonded to the nitrogen). The lone pair on the nitrogen pushes electron density into the ring, making the β-carbon act like a carbanion.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`), also known as crotononitrile, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center.\n    3.  **Reaction:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and generates an iminium ion intermediate. The acidic workup (`H₃O⁺`) serves two purposes: it protonates the nitrile intermediate and, crucially, it hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n        *   **Attack:** The enamine attacks `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`.\n        *   **Resulting Alkyl Group:** The fragment added to the cyclohexanone ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n        *   **Hydrolysis:** The enamine functionality is converted back to a ketone (cyclohexanone). The alkyl group is attached at the α-position (C2) of the original ketone.\n    4.  **Naming Product (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at the C2 position.\n        *   Naming this as a substituted butanenitrile (where the nitrile carbon is C1): `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(substituent)-C⁴H₃`.\n        *   The substituent on C3 is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n        *   Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.

We can identify these by cleaving the bond formed during the Michael addition.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor:** The problem states that but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK) is one of the reactants. In the product, this corresponds to the \"3-oxobutyl\" side chain (`-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`). This group is formed by adding a nucleophile to the β-carbon and a proton to the α-carbon of MVK (`CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`).\n    3.  **Michael Donor (Reactant C):** The rest of the molecule is the Michael donor. This is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system. The bond was formed at the C2 position of this ring. The C2 protons of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic because they are located between two carbonyl groups (an active methylene group). The base (`KOH`) removes one of these protons to form a highly stabilized enolate, which then acts as the nucleophile in the Michael addition.\n    4.  **Conclusion for C:** Therefore, reactant `C` is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the three reactions to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n**Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n**Reagents:** NaOEt, EtOH (Sodium ethoxide in ethanol)\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleophile (Michael Donor):** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that will deprotonate the most acidic proton. Dimethyl malonate has acidic α-protons on the carbon between the two ester groups (pKa ≈ 13). The base deprotonates this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, which acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   **Nucleophile Formation:** CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt → ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ Na⁺ + EtOH\n\n2.  **Identify the Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon double-bonded to the α-carbon and also attached to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic due to resonance with the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Structure:** p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a conjugate addition reaction.\n    *   **Attack:** ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃ → (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-⁻CH-COOCH₃\n    *   This forms a new enolate intermediate.\n\n4.  **Protonation:** The intermediate enolate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n    *   **Product Formation:** (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-⁻CH-COOCH₃ + EtOH → (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻\n\n5.  **Identify Product A:** The structure of the product is (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃. Let's match this to the names provided.\n    *   **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate:** This name describes a three-carbon chain (propane) derived from the malonate carbon (C1) and the two carbons of the acrylate double bond (C2 and C3). The p-tolyl group is on C2, and the three trimethyl carboxylate groups are at positions C1, C1, and C3. This matches the product structure.\n    *   **trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate:** This name would imply a different connectivity that does not result from this reaction.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction B:\n**Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n**Reagents:** MeOH, H₃O⁺\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleophile (Michael Donor):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the carbon that was α to the original ketone's carbonyl). This reaction is a Stork enamine synthesis, which is a variation of the Michael addition.\n\n2.  **Identify the Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (attached to the methyl group) is electrophilic.\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n\n4.  **Hydrolysis:** The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) in the workup step hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group. The overall result is the alkylation of the cyclohexanone at its α-position.\n\n5.  **Identify Product B:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-carbon (C2) with the group derived from the butenenitrile acceptor. The added group is -CH(CH₃)CH₂CN.\n    *   **Product Structure:** 2-[CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Naming:** The principal functional group is the nitrile (CN). The parent chain is a butanenitrile. Numbering from the nitrile carbon, the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3. The substituent is a (2-oxocyclohexyl) group.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name, 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, describes the enol tautomer, which is the minor product; the ketone is the major, more stable product.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction C:\n**Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n**Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n**Reagents:** KOH, H₂O\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retro-Michael):** We are given the product and one reactant and need to find the other reactant (C). This is a Michael addition. The product is formed by creating a bond between the nucleophile (enolate of C) and the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor:** The reactant is but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).\n    *   **Structure:** CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   After the reaction, this fragment becomes the substituent on the nucleophile. The double bond is reduced, and a proton is added to the α-carbon, resulting in the group -CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-C(=O)CH₃. This is a **3-oxobutyl** group.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael Donor (C):** The product is named 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This tells us that the 3-oxobutyl group (from MVK) is attached to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic methylene protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   This enolate then attacks MVK to form the final product.\n    *   Thus, the starting material **C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The alternative, 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, is an incorrect structure and not the reactant.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A:\n**Reactants:**\n*   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate (CH₂(COOCH₃)₂)\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃)\n*   **Base/Solvent:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH)\n\n**Mechanism:**\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The base, NaOEt, is strong enough to deprotonate the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate. The α-protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 13) because the resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by resonance with both adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt ⇌ ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ Na⁺ + EtOH\n\n2.  **Michael Addition (1,4-Conjugate Addition):** The nucleophilic enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The β-carbon is the one bonded to the p-tolyl group.\n    p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃ + ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - C⁻H-COOCH₃\n\n3.  **Protonation:** The resulting intermediate enolate is protonated by the solvent, ethanol, to yield the final neutral product.\n    p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - C⁻H-COOCH₃ + EtOH → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻\n\n**Product (A):**\nThe structure of the product is p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃.\nTo name this compound according to the options, we can consider it a substituted propane chain where the main carbons are C(α) of the malonate, C(β) of the acrylate, and C(α) of the acrylate. This systematic naming leads to **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This matches the structure derived from the reaction.\n\n### Reaction B:\n**Reactants:**\n*   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine (an enamine, a nitrogen analog of an enolate)\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN)\n*   **Solvent/Workup:** Methanol (MeOH), followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺)\n\n**Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n1.  **Enamine Formation (Implied):** The enamine is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. It serves as the nucleophile. The nucleophilic carbon is the α-carbon of the original ketone (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium ion.\n3.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium ion back to a carbonyl group. The piperidine is removed, and the cyclohexanone ring is reformed.\n\n**Product (B):**\nThe final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-carbon (C2) with the remnant of the butenenitrile. The substituent is -CH(CH₃)CH₂CN. The keto form is the major product after acidic workup.\nThe structure is 2-substituted cyclohexanone. Naming this compound with the nitrile as the principal functional group gives **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n**Reactants and Product:**\n*   **Michael Donor:** C (unknown)\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (also known as methyl vinyl ketone or MVK, CH₂=CH-COCH₃)\n*   **Base/Solvent:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water (H₂O)\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n**Retrosynthesis (Working backwards):**\n1.  **Identify the new bond:** The Michael reaction forms a bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n2.  **Analyze the product:** The product is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring with a substituent at C2. The substituent is a \"3-oxobutyl\" group: -CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃.\n3.  **Analyze the acceptor:** The acceptor is MVK, CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃. After the Michael addition and protonation, it becomes the -CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃ group. The new bond is formed at its β-carbon (the CH₂ group).\n4.  **Identify the donor:** The new bond is between the C2 of the dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK. Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of the molecule from which the dione ring originates. The protons on C2 of a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound are highly acidic and are readily removed by a base like KOH to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n5.  **Conclusion for C:** The starting material C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n**Summary of Conclusions:**\n*   A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these conclusions with the given options:\n*   A) A = correct, B = correct, C = incorrect (2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione is the wrong reactant).\n*   B) A = correct, B = correct, C = correct.\n*   C) A = incorrect, B = incorrect, C = incorrect.\n*   D) A = incorrect, B = incorrect, C = correct.\n\nTherefore, option B correctly identifies all reactants and products.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂, has acidic protons on the central carbon (α-carbon) because the resulting negative charge is stabilized by resonance with two adjacent carbonyl groups. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates dimethyl malonate to form a nucleophilic enolate ion:\n    `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The p-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position.\n    Structure: `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`\n    The β-carbon is the electrophilic site that will be attacked by the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:** The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The π electrons of the double bond move to the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(β)(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻C(α)H-COOCH₃`\n\n4.  **Protonation:** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent, ethanol (EtOH), to yield the final product (A).\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂(α) - COOCH₃`\n\n5.  **Naming the Product (A):** Let's analyze the structure `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂ - COOCH₃`. This can be named as a substituted propane tricarboxylate. The main chain consists of the three carbons that form the backbone of the new molecule: the α-carbon from the malonate and the α and β carbons from the acrylate.\n    *   Let C1 be the carbon from dimethyl malonate, which is bonded to two `-COOCH₃` groups.\n    *   Let C2 be the β-carbon from the acrylate, which is bonded to the `p-tolyl` group.\n    *   Let C3 be the α-carbon from the acrylate, which is bonded to the final `-COOCH₃` group (via its carbonyl carbon).\n    The structure is `(MeOOC)₂CH(1)-CH(p-tolyl)(2)-CH₂(3)-COOMe`. This name corresponds to **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are excellent nucleophiles at the β-carbon (the C2 of the original cyclohexanone ring). This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which proceeds via a Michael addition mechanism.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    Structure: `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`\n    The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:** The nucleophilic carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond and an iminium ion intermediate.\n\n4.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group. This regenerates the cyclohexanone ring. The nitrile group remains intact under these mild conditions. The final product (B) is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position. The substituent is derived from the but-2-enenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n5.  **Naming the Product (B):** The product is 2-(-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN)cyclohexanone. According to IUPAC rules, if a chain attached to a ring has a principal functional group (here, the nitrile -CN), the chain becomes the parent name.\n    *   The parent chain is butanenitrile: `NC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H-C(4)H₃`.\n    *   At position 3, there is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` substituent.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name in the options, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer. The keto form is the major, more stable product under these conditions.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retro-Michael Analysis):** We are given the product and one reactant and need to find the other reactant (C).

Structure: `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`. Upon Michael addition, this becomes the `-(CH₂)CH₂C(=O)CH₃` group seen in the product.\n4.  **Michael Donor (Reactant C):** The new bond in the product is between the C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring and the β-carbon of the MVK. This means the nucleophile was the enolate of the species at the C2 position. The protons at C2 of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` are highly acidic because they are flanked by two carbonyl groups. The base (KOH) deprotonates this position to form the nucleophilic enolate.

This reaction is a specific type of Michael addition known as the Stork enamine synthesis.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`, also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center.\n    3.  **Reaction:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium ion. The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) serves to hydrolyze this iminium ion back into a ketone.\n    4.  **Product Structure:** The starting ketone was cyclohexanone. A new substituent is added at its α-position (C2). The substituent comes from the but-2-enenitrile fragment `CH₃-CH-CH₂-CN`. The bond forms between C2 of the ring and the original β-carbon of the nitrile. The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at the C2 position.\n    5.  **Product Name (B):** This product can be named as a substituted butanenitrile. The butanenitrile chain is `C⁴H₃-C³H-C²H₂-C¹N`. The substituent at C3 is the `2-oxocyclohexyl` group. Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is generally not the major product under these (acidic workup) conditions.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Reagents:** KOH, H₂O\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **Analysis:** This is a problem where we must deduce the starting material (C).\n    1.  **Analyze the knowns:** The product is formed from a Michael addition between reactant C and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK). The reagent is a base (KOH).\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`) is the Michael acceptor.\n    3.  **Michael Donor:** Reactant C must be the Michael donor. The base (KOH) will deprotonate it to form the nucleophile.\n    4.  **Retrosynthesis:** We can identify C by mentally reversing the Michael addition. The bond formed connects the nucleophile (from C) to the β-carbon of the acceptor (MVK).\n        *   Product: `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` part is the core structure. The `-(3-oxobutyl)` group is `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n        *   This substituent is attached to C2 of the dione ring, the highly acidic carbon between the two carbonyls.\n        *   The added fragment `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` came from the Michael acceptor `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃` after the reaction.\n        *   Therefore, the Michael donor C must have been **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a base (sodium ethoxide, NaOEt), the acidic proton on the α-carbon (the CH₂ group between the two carbonyls) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the ester group.\n\n2.  **Mechanism of the Michael Addition:**\n    *   The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.\n    *   The π electrons of the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, and the electrons of the C=O double bond shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH=C(O⁻)OCH₃`.\n    *   This enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH), typically at the α-carbon, to yield the final, neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product (A):**\n    *   The final product structure is:\n        `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`\n    *   To name this molecule, we need to identify the longest carbon chain that can serve as the parent. The options suggest a \"propane-tricarboxylate\" naming scheme. Let's orient the molecule to fit this system. The structure can be written as:\n        `(MeOOC)CH₂ - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH(COOMe)₂`\n    *   Let's number this as a substituted propane chain: `C(3)H₂(COOMe) - C(2)H(p-Tolyl) - C(1)H(COOMe)₂`.\n    *   This is a propane chain with:\n        *   Two methoxycarbonyl groups at C-1.\n        *   One p-tolyl group at C-2.\n        *   One methoxycarbonyl group at C-3.\n    *   The systematic name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This matches the name for compound A in options B and D.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type and Reactants:**\n    *   This is a **Stork enamine synthesis**, which utilizes an enamine as the nucleophile in a Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system (the C-2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   The β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms a C-C bond, generating an iminium ion from the enamine part and a resonance-stabilized anion from the nitrile part.\n    *   The anion is protonated.\n    *   Finally, the addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion intermediate back to a ketone.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product (B):**\n    *   The reaction attaches the `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` fragment (from but-2-enenitrile) to the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone).\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone:\n        `2-[CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]-cyclohexanone`\n    *   To name this product, we can consider the butanenitrile chain as the parent. The chain originating from the acceptor is `N≡C-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-`.\n    *   This is a butanenitrile backbone, numbered `N≡C(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(subst)-C(4)H₃`.\n    *   The substituent on C-3 is the cyclohexanone ring, attached at its C-2 position. The name for this substituent group is `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the product name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile` is the enol form, which is not the major product after acidic hydrolysis. This matches the name for compound B in options B and D.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we need to find the starting Michael donor (reactant C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   The reaction forms a new bond between the donor's nucleophilic carbon and the acceptor's β-carbon.\n\n2.  **Deduce Reactant C:**\n    *   Let's analyze the product structure. It consists of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring and a `(3-oxobutyl)` side chain `(-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃)`.\n    *   The side chain `(-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃)` is formed from the Michael acceptor, MVK (`CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`), after it gets attacked at the β-carbon (`CH₂=`) and the α-carbon (`=CH-`) gets protonated. This matches perfectly.\n    *   This means the `(3-oxobutyl)` group was added to the Michael donor.\n    *   The remainder of the molecule is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety, and the new bond is at the C-2 position. The C-2 carbon (CH₂) is located between two carbonyl groups, making its protons highly acidic.\n    *   Therefore, the Michael donor (reactant C) must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the C-2 position to form the nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks MVK. This matches the name for compound C in options A and B.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBy analyzing all three reactions, we have determined:\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nThis combination of names corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH).\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Sodium ethoxide is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in the mixture. The α-protons of dimethyl malonate (the protons on the carbon between the two ester carbonyls) are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 13). NaOEt removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, which acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt <=> [⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂]Na⁺ + EtOH`\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. Due to conjugation with the carbonyl group, the β-carbon is electron-deficient and thus electrophilic.\n    *   Structure: `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`\n\n3.  **The Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a 1,4-conjugate addition. The resulting intermediate enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final product.\n    *   **Step 1 (Attack):** `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   **Step 2 (Protonation):** The intermediate is protonated to give the neutral product.\n    *   **Product Structure:** A new C-C bond is formed between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. The final structure is:\n        `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂ - COOCH₃`\n\n4.  **Name the Product (A):** The product has three methyl ester groups. We can name it as a substituted tricarboxylate on a propane backbone.\n    *   Let's analyze the name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    *   Parent: propane (`C3-C2-C1`)\n    *   Substituents:\n        *   At C1: Two `-COOCH₃` groups (`-CH(COOCH₃)₂`)\n        *   At C2: One `-p-tolyl` group\n        *   At C3: One `-COOCH₃` group (`-CH₂COOCH₃`)\n    *   Assembling this gives: `(CH₃OOC)CH₂(3) - CH(2)(p-Tolyl) - CH(1)(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   Rearranging our derived product gives `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂COOCH₃`, which matches the structure derived from the name.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH), then H₃O⁺.\n*   **Type:** Stork Enamine Alkylation (a Michael addition variant).\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are electron-rich and act as nucleophiles at the β-carbon (the C=C double bond carbon not attached to the nitrogen).\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n    *   Structure: `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`\n\n3.  **The Reaction:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an intermediate containing an iminium ion and a nitrile enolate. The subsequent acidic workup (H₃O⁺) has two functions:\n    *   It protonates the nitrile enolate.\n    *   It hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone (cyclohexanone).\n\n4.  **Determine the Product (B):** The net result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at its α-position.\n    *   The original ketone is cyclohexanone.\n    *   The group added to the α-carbon (C2) comes from but-2-enenitrile. The point of attachment is the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The fragment from the nitrile is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanone ring with this group at C2.\n    *   Let's name the product as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is butanenitrile (`-CH₂-CH₂-CN` isn't right). The main chain is `butanenitrile`, so `C4H₃-C3H-C2H₂-C1N`. The substituent is attached at C3.\n    *   The substituent is the cyclohexanone ring attached at C2, which is a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   The name is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. The keto tautomer is the major, most stable product. The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, is the enol form, which is not the major final product under these conditions.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water (H₂O).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition (Retrosynthesis problem).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Reactant:** We need to find reactant C.\n    *   Product: `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This means we have a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring with a `(3-oxobutyl)` group attached to C2. The C2 position is the CH₂ group between the two carbonyls.\n    *   Structure of the (3-oxobutyl) group: `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   Reactant/Michael Acceptor: `but-3-en-2-one`, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). Its structure is `CH₂=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthesis:** The Michael addition involves the attack of a nucleophile on the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n    *   The MVK fragment in the product is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`. This is formed when a nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (`CH₂=`) of MVK.\n    *   The new bond is between this β-carbon and the nucleophile. In the product, this bond is to C2 of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system.\n    *   This implies that the nucleophile must be the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The protons on C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic because they are flanked by two carbonyl groups and are readily removed by a base like KOH.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C:** The nucleophile (enolate) is formed from reactant C. Therefore, reactant C must be the precursor to this enolate.\n    *   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds exactly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the three reactions to determine the reactants and major final products.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(CO₂Me)₂. The α-protons between the two ester groups are acidic. The strong base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-CO₂Me`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   This attack forms a new C-C bond and creates a new enolate intermediate: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂) -CH⁻-CO₂Me`.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product (A):**\n    *   The final product structure is `(MeO₂C)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-CO₂Me`.\n    *   To name this compound using IUPAC nomenclature, we identify the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups (the esters). This is a three-carbon propane chain with carboxylate groups at positions 1, 1, and 3. The p-tolyl group is at position 2.\n    *   The systematic name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (which corresponds to the α-carbon of the parent ketone). The nucleophilic attack occurs from the C2 position of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   The enamine's nucleophilic carbon (C2 of the ring) attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms an iminium ion on the ring and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   The carbanion is protonated (likely by MeOH).\n    *   The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (a ketone).\n\n3.  **Determine the Product (B):**\n    *   The overall reaction adds the butanenitrile group to the α-carbon of cyclohexanone.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group.\n    *   To name this compound, we can treat it as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is the 4-carbon nitrile. The substituent at position 3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   The systematic name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major product after acidic hydrolysis, not the enol form.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Known Reactant:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This product consists of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system and a `-(CH₂)₂-C(=O)-CH₃` (3-oxobutyl) substituent attached at the C2 position.\n    *   **Known Reactant:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`. This is a classic Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Unknown Reactant (C):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where MVK is the acceptor. Therefore, reactant C must be the Michael donor.\n    *   The 3-oxobutyl group in the product is formed from MVK after the addition reaction. The nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (the `CH₂` group) of MVK.\n    *   This implies that the nucleophile is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` anion, which then attaches to the MVK fragment.\n    *   The starting material, C, must therefore be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The protons on the carbon between the two carbonyls (C2) are highly acidic and are easily removed by the base (KOH) to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nComparing this with the given options, option C matches all three results.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the ester carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enolate from dimethyl malonate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final, neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this compound, we can identify the main carbon chain. A common, albeit simplified, way to name such products is to consider the three-carbon chain formed by the malonate α-carbon, the acrylate β-carbon, and the acrylate α-carbon as the backbone.\n        *   C1: The carbon from dimethyl malonate, which has two methyl carboxylate groups attached (`-CH(COOCH₃)₂`).\n        *   C2: The β-carbon from the acrylate, which has the p-tolyl group attached (`-CH(p-tolyl)-`).\n        *   C3: The α-carbon from the acrylate, which is now a `-CH₂-` attached to the third methyl carboxylate group (`-CH₂-COOCH₃`).\n    *   This structure corresponds to a trimethyl ester of 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid.\n    *   Thus, **Product A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.**\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This reaction is a Stork enamine synthesis, a variation of the Michael reaction.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a resonance-stabilized carbanion on the nitrile portion.\n    *   The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) has two roles: first, to protonate the carbanion intermediate, and second, to hydrolyze the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The hydrolysis step converts the enamine functionality back to the original ketone, cyclohexanone.\n    *   A new substituent, derived from the but-2-enenitrile, is attached to the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone (the carbon that was the β-carbon of the enamine).\n    *   The fragment from but-2-enenitrile is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group at the 2-position.\n    *   To name this compound, we can consider butanenitrile as the parent chain. The cyano group (`-CN`) is carbon 1.\n        *   `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`\n    *   A 2-oxocyclohexyl group is attached at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Thus, **Product B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.**\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor by Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** But-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   In the Michael reaction, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (`CH₂`) and a proton adds to the α-carbon (`CH`). This means the fragment `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃` (a 3-oxobutyl group) from MVK is added to the nucleophile.\n    *   The product structure shows this exact `3-oxobutyl` group attached to the C2 position of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of Reactant C:**\n    *   The fragment that is not derived from MVK is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety, with the connection at C2.\n    *   This implies that the Michael donor was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione (the methylene group between two carbonyls) are highly acidic and are readily removed by a base like KOH to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Therefore, **Reactant C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches the descriptions in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂.

The nucleophilic carbon is the α-carbon of the parent ketone (cyclohexanone).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Reagents:** The initial reaction occurs in methanol (MeOH). The subsequent workup with H₃O⁺ is crucial for hydrolyzing the intermediate iminium salt back into a ketone.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion and a resonance-stabilized nitrile anion.\n    *   The anion is protonated.\n    *   The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt, regenerating the carbonyl group (ketone) at C1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product (B):**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the cyclohexanone ring system attacks the β-carbon (`-CH(CH₃)-`) of the acceptor.\n    *   The acceptor's α-carbon becomes `-CH₂-CN` after protonation.\n    *   The new substituent on the cyclohexane ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`. This substituent is at the α-position (C2) relative to the carbonyl group.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at C2.\n    *   To name this product, we consider the butanenitrile as the parent chain: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`.\n    *   The substituent is at position 3, and it is a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   Thus, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify the knowns and unknowns (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Reactant C (unknown).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Product and Acceptor:**\n    *   The product is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione with a substituent at C2.\n    *   The substituent is a `-(3-oxobutyl)` group: `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the acceptor (MVK) adds a fragment to the donor.

Let's consider a three-carbon (propane) backbone.\n    *   If we number the carbons as `C1-C2-C3` where `C1` is the `CH` from the malonate, `C2` is the `CH` from the acrylate, and `C3` is the `CH2` from the acrylate, the structure looks like this: `(CH3OOC)2-C1H - C2H(p-tolyl) - C3H2-COOCH3`.\n    *   This molecule is a tricarboxylate. There are two methyl carboxylate (`-COOCH3`) groups on C1 and one on C3. There is a p-tolyl group on C2.\n    *   Therefore, the systematic name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, a variation of the Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at their β-carbon.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`), also known as crotononitrile, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an intermediate containing an iminium ion (from the enamine part) and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion, which is quickly protonated.\n    *   The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (`H3O+`) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (a ketone).\n\n3.  **Predict the Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The piperidine is removed, and the C1 of the cyclohexane ring becomes a ketone (C=O).\n    *   The `(E)-but-2-enenitrile` moiety becomes a `CH(CH3)-CH2-CN` group attached to the α-carbon (C2) of the newly formed cyclohexanone.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position with a 3-cyanobutyl group.\n\n4.  **Name the Product (B):**\n    *   The product is a butanenitrile derivative. The parent chain is `butanenitrile`.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on this chain. It is attached at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The substituent name is (2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   Thus, the name of product B is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative option, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol form, which is typically the minor tautomer compared to the more stable keto form under these conditions.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where we need to find one of the starting materials. This requires a retrosynthetic analysis.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Product and Known Reactant:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This means a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring has a `-(CH2)2-CO-CH3` (3-oxobutyl) group at position C2.\n    *   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** But-3-en-2-one (`CH2=CH-CO-CH3`), also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).\n\n3.  **Perform Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   In a Michael addition, the new C-C bond forms between the β-carbon of the acceptor and the α-carbon of the donor.\n    *   The acceptor (MVK) is `CH2(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH3`. The `(3-oxobutyl)` side chain in the product corresponds to this molecule after the reaction. The bond to the donor is at the `CH2` (former β-carbon).\n    *   The donor's nucleophilic carbon is the C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring, which is acidic.\n    *   To find reactant C, we break the bond between C2 of the ring and the side chain.\n    *   Breaking this bond gives us the enolate of C and the acceptor. Adding a proton to the enolate reveals the identity of the Michael donor, C.\n    *   Therefore, reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Forward Reaction:**\n    *   Cyclohexane-1,3-dione has a highly acidic methylene group at C2 (pKa ≈ 5).\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates C2 to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    *   This enolate attacks the β-carbon of but-3-en-2-one.\n    *   Protonation of the resulting intermediate yields the given product. The mechanism is consistent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **A** is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   **B** is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   **C** is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nComparing this with the given options, we find that option B contains all the correct assignments.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate (nucleophile precursor), methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (Michael acceptor), and sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH) (base/solvent).\n*   **Step 1: Nucleophile Formation.** Sodium ethoxide is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate. The α-protons are acidic because the resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by resonance across two adjacent ester carbonyl groups.\n    *   `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt → Na⁺[⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂] + EtOH`\n    *   The nucleophile is the malonate anion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition.** The Michael acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The nucleophilic malonate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon (the carbon bonded to the p-tolyl group).\n    *   The attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond and a resonance-stabilized enolate intermediate: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH⁻-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Step 3: Protonation.** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent, ethanol, to yield the final neutral product (A).\n    *   `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH⁻-COOCH₃ + EtOH → p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n*   **Step 4: Naming the Product (A).** The structure is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`. To name this according to IUPAC rules as a tricarboxylate, we identify the main propane chain.\n    *   `C¹H(COOMe)₂ - C²H(p-tolyl) - C³H₂(COOMe)` is not the correct connectivity based on the reaction mechanism.\n    *   The correct structure derived is `p-tolyl-CH[CH(COOCH₃)₂]-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   Let's find the correct IUPAC name based on the options. The name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" corresponds to the structure `(MeOOC)₂-C¹H - C²H(p-tolyl) - C³H₂(COOMe)`. Let's map the atoms from the reaction to this structure.\n        *   The `CH(COOMe)₂` group comes from dimethyl malonate. Let's call this C1.\n        *   This C1 attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate, which is `CH(p-tolyl)`. Let's call this C2.\n        *   C2 is bonded to the α-carbon of the acrylate, which becomes `CH₂(COOMe)`. Let's call this C3.\n        *   The resulting structure is `(MeOOC)₂C¹H - C²H(p-tolyl) - C³H₂(COOMe)`. This perfectly matches the product derived from the mechanism.\n    *   Thus, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine (an enamine, the nucleophile), (E)-but-2-enenitrile (Michael acceptor), followed by workup with H₃O⁺. This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which is a type of Michael addition.\n*   **Step 1: Nucleophile and Acceptor.** The enamine is nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). The acceptor is `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`, and the β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition.** The α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a C-C bond and an intermediate containing an iminium ion on the cyclohexane ring and a carbanion α to the nitrile group.\n*   **Step 3: Protonation and Hydrolysis.** The carbanion is protonated (likely by the methanol solvent). Then, the addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group. Since the enamine was formed from cyclohexanone, it hydrolyzes back to cyclohexanone.\n*   **Step 4: Structure of the Product (B).** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2). The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile acceptor. The new bond is between C2 of the ring and C3 of the butene chain.\n    *   The side chain is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n    *   To name the compound, the nitrile is the principal functional group. The chain is a butanenitrile. The cyclohexanone is a substituent at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major product after acidic workup, not the enol form (`3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`).\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** An unknown reactant C and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Analysis (Retrosynthesis).** This is a Michael addition. The product is formed by adding a nucleophile to the Michael acceptor, MVK (`CH₂=CH-COCH₃`).\n*   **Step 1: Identify the bond formed.** The product is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` with a `-(CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃)` group at C2. This \"3-oxobutyl\" group is derived from MVK. A nucleophile must have attacked the β-carbon (`CH₂`) of MVK, which after protonation gives the `-CH₂CH₂COCH₃` group.\n*   **Step 2: Identify the nucleophile.** The nucleophile must therefore be the part of the molecule that is attached to this group, which is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring, attached via C2.\n*   **Step 3: Identify Reactant C.** The active nucleophile is the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`, formed by deprotonation of the highly acidic proton at C2 (located between two carbonyls) by the base (KOH). Therefore, the starting material **C must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing this with the given options, only option B matches all three results.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify Nucleophile and Michael Acceptor:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The protons on the central carbon (Cα) are acidic due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the two adjacent ester groups.\n    *   **Base:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that deprotonates the dimethyl malonate to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂. This is the active nucleophile.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. Its structure is p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃. The β-carbon is electrophilic and is the site of nucleophilic attack.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate, ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂, attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons of the C=C bond shift to form an enolate intermediate: p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH=C(O⁻)OCH₃.\n    *   This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final, stable product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product (A):**\n    *   The final product structure is p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's name this compound according to the options provided. The name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" corresponds to the following structure:\n        *   A propane chain: C3-C2-C1.\n        *   Two methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) groups on C1.\n        *   One p-tolyl group on C2.\n        *   One methoxycarbonyl group on C3.\n        *   Putting it together: (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂COOCH₃.\n    *   This structure matches our derived product.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify Nucleophile and Michael Acceptor:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine. Enamines act as carbon nucleophiles at the β-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n    *   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is a Stork enamine alkylation (a type of Michael addition), followed by acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) serves two purposes:\n        1.  It protonates the carbanion to give the -CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN side chain.\n        2.  It hydrolyzes the iminium ion (C=N⁺R₂) back to a ketone (C=O).\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product (B):**\n    *   The reaction attaches the butenenitrile fragment to the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone).\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position with a -CH(CH₃)CH₂CN group.\n    *   Let's name this product. The parent chain is butanenitrile (numbering starts from the CN group: C1 is CN, C4 is CH₃). The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on C3. The ketone is at position 2 of the cyclohexyl ring. Thus, the substituent is (2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full IUPAC name is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. The keto form is the stable product after hydrolysis, not the enol form (`-hydroxycyclohexenyl`).\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we are given the product and one reactant (the Michael acceptor) and must find the other reactant (the nucleophile precursor, C).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   Let's dissect the product. It consists of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring and a (3-oxobutyl) group (-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃) attached at position 2.\n\n2.  **Identify the Nucleophile:**\n    *   In a Michael addition to MVK, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (the CH₂ group), and the C=C double bond becomes a C-C single bond. This process converts MVK into the -CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃ (3-oxobutyl) fragment found in the product.\n    *   This means the other part of the product, the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring, must have come from the nucleophile.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the most acidic proton on reactant C to form the nucleophile. In cyclohexane-1,3-dione, the protons at C2 (the methylene group between the two carbonyls) are the most acidic.\n    *   Therefore, the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione attacks MVK.\n    *   Reactant **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of reactants and products matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A Analysis**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, [CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    2.  A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate enolate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to give the final neutral product.\n*   **Product Structure:**\n    *   Donor fragment: -CH(COOCH₃)₂\n    *   Acceptor fragment: p-tolyl-CH-CH₂-COOCH₃\n    *   Combined Product: p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃\n*   **Product Name Analysis:** Let's analyze the name given in the correct option, `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`. This name describes the product based on a conceptual three-carbon chain:\n    *   **Position 1:** The carbon from the malonate, CH(COOCH₃)₂. It carries two methyl carboxylate groups.\n    *   **Position 2:** The β-carbon from the acrylate, which is bonded to the p-tolyl group.\n    *   **Position 3:** The α-carbon from the acrylate, which is part of the -CH₂-COOCH₃ group.\n    *   Assembling these pieces according to the name gives the structure `(MeOOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂COOMe`, which is identical to the structure we derived from the reaction mechanism.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n### **Reaction B Analysis**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which functions as a Michael addition.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nucleophilic carbon is the C-2 of the cyclohexene ring (the α-carbon relative to the original ketone).\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    2.  An intermediate iminium ion is formed.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone) and protonates the nitrile intermediate.\n*   **Product Structure:**\n    *   The original enamine becomes cyclohexanone.\n    *   A new bond is formed between the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone (C-2) and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The nitrile fragment becomes -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone: a cyclohexanone ring with a -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN group attached at the C-2 position.\n*   **Product Name Analysis:** The name for this structure is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.\n    *   **Parent chain:** Butanenitrile (a four-carbon chain with a nitrile group at C-1).\n    *   **Structure:** N≡C(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H-C(4)H₃\n    *   **Substituent:** A `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group is attached to C-3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   This name perfectly describes the derived product structure. The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is less stable and not the major product for a simple ketone under these conditions.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### **Reaction C Analysis**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where we need to identify the Michael donor.\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃.\n*   **Retrosynthetic Analysis (working backward from the product):**\n    1.  Identify the portion of the product that came from the Michael acceptor (MVK). The `3-oxobutyl` group, -CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃, corresponds to the MVK molecule after it has accepted the nucleophile.\n    2.  The new C-C bond in the product is between the `3-oxobutyl` group and C-2 of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n    3.  This means the nucleophile was the enolate of the molecule that provided the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` framework.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile C):** The protons on the carbon at position 2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are flanked by two carbonyl groups, making them highly acidic (pKa ≈ 5). The base (KOH) easily deprotonates this carbon to form a stable enolate. This enolate then acts as the nucleophile.\n*   Therefore, the starting reactant **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination corresponds exactly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the three reactions to determine the correct reactants and major products.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a base (sodium ethoxide, NaOEt), the highly acidic α-proton between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   This attack pushes the π-electrons onto the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - C⁻H-COOCH₃`.\n    *   This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The final product has the structure: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n\n4.  **Name Product A:**\n    *   To name this molecule, we can consider it a derivative of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid.\n    *   The carbon chain is: C¹(H)(COOCH₃)₂ - C²(H)(p-tolyl) - C³(H₂)COOCH₃.\n    *   The IUPAC name is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n    *   This matches the name given for A in options A and B.

Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. It is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion at the cyclohexanone part and a carbanion stabilized by the nitrile group.\n    *   The reaction is followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). This workup serves two purposes:\n        1.  It protonates the carbanion to give `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n        2.  It hydrolyzes the iminium salt back into a ketone (cyclohexanone) and piperidinium salt.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The result is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is 2-[CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]-cyclohexanone.\n\n4.  **Name Product B:**\n    *   The parent structure is butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituent at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain is a (2-oxocyclohexyl) group.\n    *   The IUPAC name is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n    *   This corresponds to the name for B in options A and B. The name in options C and D, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is generally the minor product compared to the more stable keto form under these conditions.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction in Reverse (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where the product is known, and we must identify the starting nucleophile (Reactant C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The main structure is a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring, and the substituent at position 2 is a `3-oxobutyl` group (-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the acceptor. Here, the β-carbon is the CH₂ group. After the reaction and protonation, the acceptor becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` fragment, which is exactly the `3-oxobutyl` group seen in the product.\n    *   Therefore, the bond is formed between the C2 of the nucleophile and the β-carbon of MVK.\n\n2.  **Identify Reactant C:**\n    *   The nucleophile (`C`) must be the molecule that, after losing a proton, becomes the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` anion which attacks MVK.\n    *   The starting material `C` is therefore **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The protons on the methylene carbon between the two carbonyls (C2) are very acidic (pKa ≈ 5) and are readily removed by KOH to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options for C:**\n    *   Options A and D suggest C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This is consistent with our analysis.\n    *   Options B and C suggest C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione. This is incorrect; the reactant is the simple dione.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **Product B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **Reactant C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nCombining these findings, the only option that correctly identifies all three components is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate (CH₂(COOCH₃)₂). In the presence of a base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic proton on the α-carbon (the carbon between the two carbonyl groups) is removed to form a nucleophilic enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. The p-tolyl group is a methyl-substituted phenyl ring (`-C₆H₄-CH₃`). The β-carbon is the carbon atom of the double bond that is further from the ester group (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group).\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The malonate enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    2.  The electrons from the C=C double bond shift to form an intermediate enolate, which is then protonated by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent to yield the final product.\n*   **Product Structure (A):** The `CH(COOCH₃)₂` group from the malonate adds to the β-carbon of the acrylate. The double bond of the acrylate is saturated.\n    *   Acceptor: `p-Tolyl-C(β)H=C(α)H-COOCH₃`\n    *   Addition of `CH(COOCH₃)₂` to the β-carbon gives:\n        `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂ - COOCH₃`\n*   **Naming the Product:** To name this compound according to IUPAC rules, we can consider it a derivative of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid.\n    *   The parent acid structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH(COOH)₂`.\n    *   Our product's corresponding acid is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(p-tolyl)-CH(COOH)₂`.\n    *   This is named **2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid**.\n    *   The final product is the trimethyl ester of this acid: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nitrogen analogs of enolates and are excellent nucleophiles. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system, which is the C2 of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile). Its structure is `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. The β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n*   **Mechanism:** This reaction is a Stork enamine alkylation.\n    1.  The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    2.  This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    3.  The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) in the workup step hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a ketone.\n*   **Product Structure (B):** The overall process results in the alkylation of cyclohexanone at its α-position (the carbon next to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The fragment added from the acceptor is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanone ring with this group attached at the C2 position.\n    *   The IUPAC name is based on the butanenitrile chain. The substituent is a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group attached at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, the product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, stable product, not the enol form.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reaction:** `C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`\n*   **Analysis:** We need to identify the reactant C by working backward from the product.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring with a `-(CH₂)₂-CO-CH₃` group at C2 (the acidic carbon between the two carbonyls).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), with the structure `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   The added fragment in the product, `-(CH₂)₂-CO-CH₃`, is formed from MVK after the conjugate addition and subsequent protonation/tautomerization.\n    *   This implies that the Michael donor must be the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` skeleton. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic C2 position to form the nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks the MVK.\n*   **Reactant C:** The Michael donor is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLet's match our findings with the options provided:\n*   **A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of reactants and products corresponds exactly to option D.\n\n*   A) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate (Incorrect A), B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile (Incorrect B), C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Correct C)\n*   B) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate (Correct A), B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile (Correct B), C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)\n*   C) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate (Incorrect A), B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile (Incorrect B), C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)\n*   D) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate (Correct A), B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile (Correct B), C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Correct C)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the α-carbon which is acidic because it is situated between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. This forms a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-CO₂Me`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site for conjugate addition.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to yield the final adduct.\n    *   The overall reaction is:\n        `⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂ + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-CO₂Me  →  (MeO₂C)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-C⁻H-CO₂Me`\n        `(MeO₂C)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-C⁻H-CO₂Me + EtOH  →  (MeO₂C)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-CO₂Me + EtO⁻`\n\n3.  **Identify Product A:**\n    *   The product structure is `(MeO₂C)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-CO₂Me`.\n    *   Let's name this structure according to the options. Consider a propane chain as the backbone: C1-C2-C3.\n    *   Let C1 be the carbon from the malonate (`CH(CO₂Me)₂`), C2 be the original β-carbon of the acrylate (`CH(p-tolyl)`), and C3 be the original α-carbon of the acrylate (`CH₂`), which is now attached to the third ester group.\n    *   The structure can be drawn as: `(MeO₂C)₂-C¹H - C²H(p-tolyl) - C³H₂-CO₂Me`.\n    *   Let's check the name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\":\n        *   \"propane\" indicates a 3-carbon chain (C1, C2, C3).\n        *   \"1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" means three trimethyl ester groups at positions 1, 1, and 3.\n        *   \"2-(p-tolyl)\" means a p-tolyl group is on carbon 2.\n    *   This name corresponds to the structure `MeOOC-C³H₂ - C²H(p-tolyl) - C¹H(COOMe)₂`, which matches our derived product.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which is a type of Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile with the structure `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    *   The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone.\n\n3.  **Identify Product B:**\n    *   The original enamine was derived from cyclohexanone, so hydrolysis regenerates the cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   A new C-C bond is formed between C2 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The fragment from butenenitrile is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at position 2.\n    *   Let's name this structure. We can consider the butanenitrile as the parent chain: `CN(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(C3)-CH₃(C4)`.\n    *   The substituent at C3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   So, the name is **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile` represents the enol form, which is not the major, most stable product after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify Reactant C by Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we need to find the donor (reactant C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The main ring is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The substituent at C2 is a \"3-oxobutyl\" group: `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   **Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). Its structure is `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   The bond formed during a Michael addition is between the nucleophilic carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The β-carbon of MVK is the `CH₂` group. In the product, this corresponds to the first `CH₂` of the 3-oxobutyl side chain.\n    *   Therefore, the bond that was formed is between C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   This means the Michael donor (C) must have been **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic proton at C2 (between the two carbonyls) to form the nucleophilic enolate which then attacks MVK.\n    *   The other possibility listed, 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, is not a standard representation for a stable reactant. Cyclohexane-1,3-dione is the correct starting material.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis set of reactants and products matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), is strong enough to deprotonate the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate. The resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by resonance with the two adjacent ester carbonyl groups, making it an excellent nucleophile for the Michael addition.\n        *   CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt  ⇌  Na⁺[⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂] + EtOH\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the ester carbonyl group. The *p*-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position.\n        *   Structure: p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is another enolate, which is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final neutral product.\n\n    [⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂] + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃  →  (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃\n    (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃ + EtOH  →  (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻\n\n3.  **Identify Product (A):**\n    *   The product is **(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃**.\n    *   To name this molecule, we can consider it a substituted propane chain. Let's use the name provided in the options for verification. The name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" describes the following structure:\n        *   A three-carbon propane chain (C1-C2-C3).\n        *   Two methyl carboxylate (-COOCH₃) groups on C1.\n        *   A *p*-tolyl group on C2.\n        *   One methyl carboxylate (-COOCH₃) group on C3.\n        *   This corresponds to the structure we derived: (MeOOC)₂C¹H-C²H(p-tolyl)-C³H₂-COOMe.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are analogous to enolates and are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the α-carbon of the parent ketone).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n        *   Structure: CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. This forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the original ketone and the β-carbon of the nitrile, generating an iminium salt intermediate.\n    *   **Hydrolysis:** The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt back into a ketone. The piperidine is removed and protonated.\n\n3.  **Identify Product (B):**\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The substituent is derived from but-2-enenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   So, the product is 2-(1-methyl-2-cyanoethyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's name this compound according to IUPAC rules. The nitrile group (CN) has higher priority than the ketone group (C=O). Thus, the parent chain is the butanenitrile.\n        *   The butanenitrile chain is NC¹-C²H₂-C³H-C⁴H₃.\n        *   The substituent is on C3, and it is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n    *   This confirms that product B matches the description in options A and B.

KOH is the base to generate the nucleophile.\n    *   **Unknown:** Reactant C, the Michael Donor.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthetic Analysis:**\n    *   The Michael reaction forms a bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   Let's identify this bond in the product. The product is a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring with a `2-(3-oxobutyl)` substituent. The substituent is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`. This chain came from MVK (`CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`). The C-C bond formed is between the C2 of the dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK (the terminal CH₂).\n    *   To find reactant C, we break this bond. Breaking the bond between the ring and the side chain gives us the two starting components (in their reactive, ionic forms): the enolate of reactant C and the electrophilic form of MVK.\n    *   The nucleophile is the enolate of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` where C2 is deprotonated. The hydrogens on C2 are particularly acidic because the negative charge is stabilized by two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the starting material C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n3.  **Verify with a formula check:**\n    *   Product: 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione (C₁₀H₁₄O₃)\n    *   Reactant (MVK): but-3-en-2-one (C₄H₆O)\n    *   Reactant (C) + C₄H₆O → C₁₀H₁₄O₃\n    *   By subtraction, reactant C must have the formula C₁₀H₁₄O₃ - C₄H₆O = C₆H₈O₂.\n    *   Let's check the formula for the options for C:\n        *   `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`: C₆H₈O₂. This matches.\n        *   `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione`: C₆H₈O₃. This does not match.\n\n    *   Therefore, **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nThis combination of reactants and products matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`. In the presence of a base (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `(p-CH₃C₆H₄)CH=CHCOOCH₃`.

The electrophilic carbon for Michael addition is the β-carbon (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to form an enolate intermediate from the acrylate portion.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   Reactants: `(p-CH₃C₆H₄)-CβH=CαH-COOCH₃` and `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   The new bond forms between the β-carbon of the acrylate and the central carbon of the malonate.\n    *   Structure after attack and protonation: `(p-CH₃C₆H₄)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`.\n\n4.  **Match the Structure with the Given Names:**\n    *   Let's analyze the name from option B: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n    *   Let's deconstruct this name to draw the structure:\n        *   The parent chain is a propane with three trimethyl carboxylate groups (`-COOCH₃`).\n        *   The locants `1,1,3` indicate the positions of these carboxylate groups. However, a `C1-C2-C3` propane chain cannot have a substituent at position 3 and also two at position 1. This name seems to be based on a parent tricarboxylic acid, `propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid`.\n        *   Let's build the structure based on connectivity: A central carbon (`C2`) is bonded to a p-tolyl group. This `C2` is also bonded to a `CH(COOCH₃)₂` group (representing `C1`) and a `CH₂(COOCH₃)` group (representing `C3`).\n        *   Structure: `(COOCH₃)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`.\n    *   This structure matches the one we derived from the reaction mechanism: `(p-CH₃C₆H₄)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`.\n    *   Therefore, A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a nucleophilic enolate equivalent. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system, which is C2 of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃CH=CHCN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The electrophilic β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   The nucleophilic C2 of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms a new C-C bond and generates an iminium ion on the cyclohexane ring and an anion on the butenenitrile chain.\n    *   The anion is protonated.\n    *   Finally, the acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The reaction connects C2 of the cyclohexane ring to C3 of the butanenitrile chain (`CH₃-C3H-C2H₂-C1N`).\n    *   The substituent formed from the nitrile is `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   The enamine is hydrolyzed to a cyclohexanone. The substituent is at position 2 (α to the new carbonyl group).\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at the C2 position.\n    *   Naming this compound with the nitrile as the principal functional group, the parent chain is butanenitrile. The substituent at position 3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, most stable tautomer.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction in Reverse (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CHCOCH₃`.\n    *   The reaction is a Michael addition. The nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (`CH₂`) of MVK. After protonation, the MVK moiety becomes a `–CH₂CH₂COCH₃` group, which is a `(3-oxobutyl)` group. This matches the product description.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Reactant C):** The `(3-oxobutyl)` group is attached to C2 of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system. This implies that the nucleophile was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`, formed by the deprotonation of the highly acidic C2 methylene proton by KOH.\n\n2.  **Identify Reactant C:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the results for all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), abstracts one of the highly acidic α-protons located between the two carbonyl groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-CH₃C₆H₄-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon (the carbon attached to the tolyl group) is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   **Step 1 (Enolate formation):** `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt → Na⁺⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + EtOH`\n    *   **Step 2 (Nucleophilic attack):** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and the C=O π-electrons shift to the oxygen, forming another enolate intermediate.\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to give the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product (A):**\n    *   The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   Initial reactants: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH₂` and `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`\n    *   Product structure: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`\n    *   **Naming the product:** This compound is a substituted propane with three methyl ester groups (tricarboxylate). The main propane chain can be identified as C1-C2-C3 where C1 is the malonate carbon, C2 is the β-carbon of the acrylate, and C3 is the α-carbon of the acrylate.\n        *   C1 has two `-COOCH₃` groups.\n        *   C2 has the `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   C3 is attached to the third `-COOCH₃` group (as `-CH₂COOCH₃`).\n    *   The IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This matches option A.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Reaction):**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a neutral enolate equivalent. The nucleophilic carbon is the C2 of the cyclohexene ring (the β-carbon relative to the nitrogen atom).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (`-CH(CH₃)-`) is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Michael Addition):** The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and results in an intermediate iminium ion and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   **Step 2 (Protonation):** The carbanion is protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n    *   **Step 3 (Hydrolysis):** The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone), regenerating the catalyst (piperidine, as piperidinium salt) and yielding the final product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product (B):**\n    *   The reaction starts with an equivalent of cyclohexanone (as its enamine).\n    *   The substituent from but-2-enenitrile is added to the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone.\n    *   The new C-C bond is between the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The added fragment is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the 2-position with a `3-nitrilobutyl` group.\n    *   Structure: 2-substituted cyclohexanone, with the substituent being `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   **Naming the product:** Treating butanenitrile as the parent chain, the substituent at C3 is a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group. The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. This corresponds to the keto form, which is the major, stable product after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify Reactant C by Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   This is a Michael addition reaction where we are given the product and need to find one of the reactants (the Michael donor C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** C. The base is KOH.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Product Structure:**\n    *   The product consists of two parts joined by a new C-C bond:\n        1.  A `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety.\n        2.  A `3-oxobutyl` group (`-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`) attached to position 2 of the dione ring.\n    *   In a Michael reaction, the nucleophile (donor) attacks the β-carbon of the acceptor. The α-carbon of a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound is highly acidic and readily forms an enolate. Therefore, C2 of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring is the nucleophilic center.\n    *   The `3-oxobutyl` side chain must have come from the Michael acceptor, `but-3-en-2-one` (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`). The C2 of the dione ring attacks the β-carbon (`CH₂=`) of MVK.\n    *   After the attack, the intermediate enolate is protonated to give the side chain `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n\n3.  **Determine Reactant C:**\n    *   By breaking the bond between the ring's C2 and the side chain, we can identify the original reactants.\n    *   The fragment that provides the nucleophilic enolate is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   **Product A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **Product B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **Reactant C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   **A)** A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **B)** A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate (Incorrect A), B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile (Incorrect B), C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **C)** A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate (Incorrect A), B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile (Incorrect B), C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)\n*   **D)** A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)\n\nThe correct choice is A, as it correctly identifies all reactants and major products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), one of the acidic α-protons (the protons on the carbon between the two carbonyl groups) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The p-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position. The β-carbon (the carbon atom bonded to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    2.  The π electrons from the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and the π electrons from the C=O bond shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n    3.  This intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final product.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    Donor: `(H₃COOC)₂CH⁻`\n    Acceptor: `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`\n    Product: `(H₃COOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`\n*   **Product Name (A):** The product is a triester. To name it systematically, we can consider the propane chain formed by the α-carbon of the malonate, and the β- and α-carbons of the acrylate.\n    - C1 from the malonate (with two -COOCH₃ groups).\n    - C2 from the acrylate's β-carbon (with the p-tolyl group).\n    - C3 from the acrylate's α-carbon (which becomes a CH₂). There is also a -COOCH₃ group attached to the chain derived from the original acrylate's ester group.\n    A common way to name such adducts is as a substituted propane tricarboxylate.\n    The structure `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe` can be named **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This name correctly identifies the propane backbone with carboxylate groups at positions 1, 1, and 3, and a p-tolyl substituent at position 2.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and serve as potent carbon nucleophiles at the α-carbon (C2 of the original cyclohexanone).\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH=CH-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (the CH attached to the methyl group) is the electrophilic center.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    1.  The α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    2.  This forms an iminium salt of the Michael adduct.\n    3.  The final step is hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺), which cleaves the iminium salt and regenerates the ketone.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    A new C-C bond is formed between the C2 of the cyclohexanone ring and the C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    The substituent added to the cyclohexanone ring is `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    After hydrolysis, the product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n    Product: 2-(1-cyanopropan-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Product Name (B):** A more systematic name is to consider the compound as a substituted butanenitrile. The parent chain is butanenitrile. At position 3, there is a (2-oxocyclohexyl) group.\n    The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\nThis is a retrosynthesis problem where we need to identify the starting material 'C'.\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Reagent:** KOH (a base).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Michael addition. The product is formed by adding a Michael donor (from C) to the Michael acceptor (MVK).\n    - **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one, CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (the terminal CH₂).\n    - **Formation of the side chain:** When a nucleophile (Nu⁻) attacks MVK, the resulting group after protonation is `Nu-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`. This corresponds to the `-(3-oxobutyl)` group attached to the main ring in the product.\n    - **Michael Donor (C):** The `Nu-` part in our product is the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring attached at C2. Therefore, the nucleophile must be the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are particularly acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by resonance with two carbonyl groups.\n*   **Reactant Name (C):** The reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n-   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n-   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n-   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** Michael Addition\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the acidic α-carbon (the CH₂ group flanked by two esters) to form a resonance-stabilized enolate,⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure is p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester. The resulting intermediate is then protonated by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent on the α-carbon.\n    1.  **Attack:**  ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ attacks the β-carbon.\n    2.  **Product Formation:** A new C-C bond forms between the malonate carbon and the β-carbon of the acrylate. The α-carbon gets a hydrogen.\n        *   Product Structure: p-tolyl-CH[CH(COOCH₃)₂]-CH₂-COOCH₃. This can be drawn as (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂COOCH₃.\n*   **Naming Product (A):** This structure can be named systematically, though the common name provided in the options is a bit tricky. Let's analyze the name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    *   This name considers a three-carbon chain as the backbone, connecting the three carboxylate functionalities.\n    *   **C1:** The malonate carbon, `CH(COOCH₃)₂`. It has two ester groups (hence `1,1-`).\n    *   **C2:** The β-carbon from the acrylate, `CH(p-tolyl)`. It has the p-tolyl substituent (hence `2-(p-tolyl)`).\n    *   **C3:** The α-carbon from the acrylate, which becomes a `CH₂` group. The original ester of the acrylate is now attached to this position (hence `3-tricarboxylate`).\n    *   Connecting these gives `(CH₃OOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)(p-tolyl)-CH₂(3)COOCH₃`. This structure matches the one derived from the reaction mechanism.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** Stork Enamine Alkylation (a variant of Michael Addition).\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The β-carbon to the nitrogen (C2 of the cyclohexene ring) is the nucleophilic center.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile). The structure is CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    2.  This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    3.  An acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n*   **Product Formation (B):**\n    *   The original cyclohexanone ring is regenerated.\n    *   A new substituent is attached at the α-position (C2) of the cyclohexanone.\n    *   The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile: the `CH₃-CH` group is attacked, and the `CH-CN` is protonated, yielding a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` chain.\n    *   The final product is cyclohexanone with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at position 2.\n*   **Naming Product (B):** The principal functional group is the nitrile (CN). The main chain is a butanenitrile. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on carbon 3 of the nitrile chain. The substituent is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major stable product after acidic workup, not the enol form.\n\n### Reaction C\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** Michael Addition (working backwards).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (Methyl Vinyl Ketone, MVK). Structure: CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃.\n*   **Mechanism (Retro-Michael):** A Michael addition involves forming a bond between a nucleophile (from reactant C) and the β-carbon of the acceptor (MVK).\n    *   The fragment added from MVK is `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-CO-CH₃`. This is a `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   The product name shows this `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to the C2 position of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` molecule.\n    *   The C2 position of a 1,3-dione (`-CO-CH₂-CO-`) is highly acidic. In the presence of a base (KOH), it is readily deprotonated to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Identifying Reactant (C):** The nucleophile that adds to MVK must be the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   Therefore, the starting reactant **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMatching the identified compounds with the given options:\n*   **A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(CO₂Me)₂. The strong base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the acidic α-hydrogen between the two carbonyl groups to form a resonance-stabilized enolate nucleophile: ⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. Its structure is p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-CO₂Me. The electrophilic site for Michael addition is the β-carbon.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate, ⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂, attacks the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The double bond electrons shift, and after workup (protonation from the solvent, EtOH), the α-carbon gets a proton.\n    *   The new C-C bond forms between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n\n3.  **Determine Product Structure (A):**\n    *   The fragment from the donor is -CH(CO₂Me)₂.\n    *   The fragment from the acceptor is p-tolyl-CH-CH₂-CO₂Me.\n    *   Combining these gives the product: **p-tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂) -CH₂-CO₂Me**.\n\n4.  **Name the Product (A):**\n    *   Let's analyze the name given in option A: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n    *   This name implies a propane chain (C1-C2-C3) with substituents. Let's build the structure from the name:\n        *   Propane backbone: C1-C2-C3\n        *   At C1: two methoxycarbonyl groups, -CH(CO₂Me)₂.\n        *   At C2: a p-tolyl group.\n        *   At C3: one methoxycarbonyl group, this must be on a methylene attached to the chain, so let's interpret it as `HOOC-CH2-`, so `-CH2COOMe`.\n        *   If we define the main chain starting from the malonate carbon, `C1 = CH(CO₂Me)₂`, `C2 = CH(p-tolyl)`, and `C3 = CH₂`, and there's a `CO₂Me` on the end. A plausible interpretation of this non-standard name leads to the structure `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n    *   This structure matches our derived product. The name in option B (`3-(p-tolyl)...`) would imply the p-tolyl group is at the other end of the chain, which would result from an incorrect addition to the α-carbon. Thus, the product name in option A is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. The electrophilic site is the β-carbon.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enamine's double bond attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    *   The final step involves hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺), which cleaves the enamine and regenerates the ketone (cyclohexanone).\n\n3.  **Determine Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The nucleophilic attack forms a bond between C2 of the cyclohexane ring and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The substituent added to the cyclohexane ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   After hydrolysis, the product is a 2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at position 2.\n\n4.  **Name the Product (B):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile. The parent chain is butanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the chain: N≡C(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(substituent)-C(4)H₃.\n    *   The substituent at C3 is the `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    *   Therefore, the product name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n    *   The keto form is more stable than the enol form (`3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`), so it is the major final product after acidic workup.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we need to identify the starting Michael donor, C.\n    *   **Product:** `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This means a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring has a `-(CH₂)₂-CO-CH₃` group at position C2.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** `but-3-en-2-one` is methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the acceptor (MVK) is attacked by a nucleophile at its β-carbon (`CH₂=`). The resulting fragment added to the nucleophile is `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, which is exactly the `3-oxobutyl` group found in the product.\n\n2.  **Identify Reactant C:**\n    *   Since the `3-oxobutyl` group comes from MVK, the rest of the molecule must be the Michael donor.\n    *   The `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to C2 of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system.\n    *   The hydrogens on C2 of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` are very acidic because the C2 carbon is located between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates this C2 position to form a highly stabilized enolate, which then acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   Therefore, reactant **C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nComparing this with the given options, all three parts match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂.

This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site for Michael addition.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π electrons of the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, and then the carbonyl π electrons shift to the oxygen, forming an intermediate enolate.\n    *   The reaction is: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃  →  (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃`\n    *   This intermediate enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) during the workup to yield the final neutral product.\n    *   Protonation occurs at the α-carbon.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product (A):**\n    *   The final product (A) has the structure: **(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃**.\n\n4.  **Naming Product (A):**\n    *   The naming of this compound can be complex.

Despite the likely error in the provided IUPAC name for product A, the combination of correct answers for B and C makes D the only logical choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n*   **Reagents:** NaOEt, EtOH (Sodium ethoxide in ethanol)\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition\n\n1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, which is acidic due to the two adjacent ester groups. This forms a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic. Its structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`.\n3.  **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons shift, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n    `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃  →  (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-⁻CH-COOCH₃` (This is one resonance structure of the intermediate enolate).\n4.  **Protonation:** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to yield the final product.\n    `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-⁻CH-COOCH₃ + EtOH → (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n5.  **Product A:** The structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`. This compound can be named as a substituted propane tricarboxylate. The IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n*   **Reagents:** MeOH, H₃O⁺\n*   **Type:** Stork Enamine Synthesis (which involves a Michael Addition)\n\n1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (the C2 position of the cyclohexene ring).\n2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile, `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n3.  **Reaction:** The α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion and a new C-C bond.\n4.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) first protonates the intermediate anion and then hydrolyzes the iminium salt back to a carbonyl group. The piperidine is removed, and a ketone is formed at the C1 position of the cyclohexane ring.\n5.  **Product B:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position. The added group is `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`. So the structure is 2-substituted cyclohexanone. Naming it as a derivative of butanenitrile, it becomes **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Reagents:** KOH, H₂O\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition (Retrosynthesis)\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Reaction:** We need to find the starting material 'C'. The reaction is a Michael addition. This reaction forms a bond between a nucleophile (the donor) and the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl/nitrile compound (the acceptor).\n2.  **Identify Donor and Acceptor fragments:** The acceptor is given as but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`. In a Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (`CH₂=`). After protonation, the MVK fragment becomes `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n3.  **Match Fragments:** This `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` fragment is exactly the (3-oxobutyl) group attached at the C2 position of the product, `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n4.  **Identify Reactant C:** Therefore, the Michael donor ('C') must be the other part of the product: **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic methylene group at C2 (between the two carbonyls) to generate the nucleophilic enolate that initiates the reaction. The most appropriate way to write the starting material is in its neutral diketone form.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A:**\n**dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify Nucleophile and Electrophile:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂.

The substituent is named `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Full name: `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. The keto tautomer is more stable than the enol (`2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl`) form, making this the major final product.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Known Reactant (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This means a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` skeleton has a `-(CH₂)₂-C(=O)CH₃` group at its C2 position.\n    *   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** `but-3-en-2-one` (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Unknown Reactant C:**\n    *   In a Michael addition, the bond forms between the Michael donor's nucleophilic carbon and the Michael acceptor's β-carbon.\n    *   The fragment from the acceptor (MVK) in the product is `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-C(=O)CH₃`, which corresponds to the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   Therefore, the Michael donor (`C`) must be the rest of the molecule, which is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system.\n    *   The C2 position of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` is highly acidic due to the two flanking carbonyl groups. The base (`KOH`) deprotonates it to form the required nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Thus, reactant `C` is **`cyclohexane-1,3-dione`**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options, we find that option D matches all three parts correctly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nThis question asks to determine the products of two Michael addition reactions (A and B) and the nucleophilic reactant of a third Michael addition reaction (C).\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, `CH2(COOCH3)2`. In the presence of a base (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton is removed to form a nucleophilic enolate: `[-]CH(COOCH3)2`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH3`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    2.  A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    3.  The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) during workup.\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The nucleophile `[-]CH(COOCH3)2` adds to the `CH` group bearing the `p-tolyl` group.\n    *   The resulting product structure is: `(CH3OOC)2CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOCH3`.\n*   **Product Naming:** The options provide systematic names based on a propane-tricarboxylate backbone. Let's analyze the product structure in that context. We can identify a 3-carbon chain linking the carboxylate groups.\n    *   `C1`: The carbon from the malonate, bearing two methoxycarbonyl groups (`-CH(COOMe)2`).\n    *   `C2`: The β-carbon from the acrylate, bearing the `p-tolyl` group.\n    *   `C3`: The α-carbon from the acrylate, which becomes a `CH2` group attached to the third methoxycarbonyl group (`-CH2-COOMe`).\n    *   Thus, we have a propane chain where C1 has two carboxylates, C3 has one carboxylate, and C2 has a p-tolyl substituent.\n    *   This corresponds to the name: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This matches the name for product A in options A and B.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine reaction, a variation of the Michael addition.\n*   **Michael Donor:** The enamine, `1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine`, is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The carbon atom β to the nitrogen atom (C2 of the cyclohexene ring) is the nucleophilic center.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile, `CH3-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    2.  This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    3.  The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (`H3O+`) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a ketone. The nitrile group is stable to these hydrolysis conditions.\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The overall reaction achieves the alkylation of the cyclohexanone at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The alkyl group added is derived from the Michael acceptor, `CH3-CH=CH-CN`. After the addition and protonation, it becomes the `–CH(CH3)CH2CN` group.\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone: a cyclohexane ring with a `=O` at C1 and the `–CH(CH3)CH2CN` group at C2.\n*   **Product Naming:**\n    *   The main functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`), so the parent name is butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituent on the butanenitrile chain is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    *   Numbering the butanenitrile chain from the nitrile carbon (`CN` is C1), the substituent `(-CH(CH3)-)` is at C3.\n    *   Thus, the product name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. This corresponds to product B in options A and B. The alternative `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile` represents the enol tautomer, which is generally less stable and not the major product after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a retrosynthesis problem for a Michael addition.\n*   **Product:** `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** `but-3-en-2-one` (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH2(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH3`.\n*   **Retrosynthesis:** A Michael addition forms a bond between the α-carbon of a nucleophile (donor) and the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated system (acceptor).\n    1.  Identify the fragment from the Michael acceptor in the product. MVK (`CH2=CH-CO-CH3`) adds to become a `–CH2–CH2–CO–CH3` group. This matches the `(3-oxobutyl)` substituent in the product.\n    2.  The new C-C bond is between the β-carbon of MVK (now the first `CH2` of the oxobutyl group) and C2 of the cyclohexane ring.\n    3.  This means the nucleophile (donor) must have been the enolate of the remaining fragment.\n    4.  The remaining fragment is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system. The enolate is formed by removing the highly acidic proton from C2, which is positioned between two carbonyl groups.\n*   **Reactant C:** The starting material C that forms this enolate upon treatment with base (KOH) is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n*   **B** is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.\n*   **C** is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n\nThis set of reactants and products corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The carbon-carbon double bond is activated by the electron-withdrawing ester group, making the β-carbon electrophilic. The numbering is `p-tolyl-CβH=CαH-COOMe`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The electron pair from the C=C double bond shifts to the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - C⁻H-COOCH₃`.\n    *   This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) or during workup to yield the final product. The proton adds to the α-carbon.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The new C-C bond is formed between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   Let's analyze the name given in the options. The name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" can be deconstructed. We can interpret this as a substituted propane tricarboxylic acid methyl ester. The base structure would be a trimethyl propanetricarboxylate, with a p-tolyl group at position 2. If we consider the chain C1-C2-C3, with two carboxylates on C1, one on C3, and a tolyl group on C2, we get the structure: `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n    *   This structure is identical to the one we derived from the reaction mechanism.\n    *   Therefore, A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an **enamine** of cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nitrogen analogs of enolates and are excellent nucleophiles. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system, which is C2 of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, making its β-carbon (`CH₃-CH=`) electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   The enamine's nucleophilic β-carbon attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms an iminium ion and a new C-C bond.\n    *   The intermediate is then subjected to acidic aqueous workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   The workup step protonates the α-carbon of the nitrile group and hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a new substituent at its α-carbon (C2).\n    *   The substituent is derived from butenenitrile: the β-carbon is attached to the ring, and the α-carbon gets a proton. The fragment is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   So, the product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group at C2.\n    *   Let's name this product from the nitrile's perspective. The main chain is a butanenitrile: `N≡C(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`. There is a substituent on C3.\n    *   The substituent is the cyclohexanone ring, attached via C2, so it's a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   The full name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n    *   The other option for B is the enol tautomer, which is generally less stable than the keto form for a simple ketone, especially after acidic workup.\n    *   This confirms that product B is correct in options B and C.\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactant C through Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we are given the product and need to find one of the reactants (the Michael donor, C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This means a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring is substituted at C2 with a `3-oxobutyl` group (`-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   **Reaction Analysis:** In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the acceptor. After protonation of the α-carbon, the MVK fragment becomes `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`, which is exactly the `3-oxobutyl` group we see in the product.\n    *   This means the C-C bond was formed between the nucleophile and the β-carbon of MVK. The product shows this bond is at C2 of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of Reactant C:**\n    *   The nucleophile must be the enolate of reactant C. Since the product is built on a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` framework, C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The methylene protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic because they are flanked by two carbonyl groups. The base (KOH) easily removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, which then acts as the Michael donor.\n    *   This confirms reactant C in options A and B.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   From reaction A, product A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. (Matches Options B, C)\n*   From reaction B, product B is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. (Matches Options B, C)\n*   From reaction C, reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. (Matches Options A, B)\n\nBy combining these three conclusions, the only option that correctly identifies all compounds is **Option B**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH2(COOCH3)2`.

This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site for conjugate addition.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The dimethyl malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The reaction mixture is then protonated (e.g., by the solvent EtOH or during acidic workup) to give the neutral adduct.\n\n3.  **Predict the Product Structure:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon from the malonate, `-CH(COOCH3)2`, adds to the β-carbon (`CH` attached to the p-tolyl group) of the acrylate.\n    *   The initial acrylate `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH3` becomes `p-Tolyl-CH(Nu)-CH2-COOCH3`, where `Nu` is the malonate part.\n    *   The final structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH2-COOCH3`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product (A):**\n    *   Let's name this molecule systematically using IUPAC rules.

Here, dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂, has acidic protons on the carbon between the two ester groups. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), removes one of these protons to form a stabilized enolate: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** The Michael acceptor is the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`, is an α,β-unsaturated ester.

This is a retrosynthesis problem.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   A Michael addition forms a bond between the nucleophilic donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor. The β-carbon of MVK is the `CH₂` group.\n    *   The fragment from MVK that is incorporated into the product is `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`. This matches the `(3-oxobutyl)` group in the product's name.\n    *   This group is attached to the C2 position of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n\n2.  **Identify Reactant (C):**\n    *   The new C-C bond is between C2 of the dione ring and the former β-carbon of MVK. This means that C2 of the dione must have acted as the nucleophile.\n    *   The protons at C2 of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione are flanked by two carbonyl groups, making them highly acidic (pKa ≈ 11). The base (KOH) easily deprotonates this position to form a stabilized enolate.\n    *   This enolate is the active Michael donor.\n    *   Therefore, the starting material C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The other option, \"2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione,\" is not a standard reactant and is an ambiguous name (it's likely meant to represent the enol tautomer, 3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one, but the diketone is the conventional starting material).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given choices, option B matches all three correctly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reactants**: Dimethyl malonate (`CH2(COOMe)2`), methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOMe`), and a base (NaOEt in EtOH).\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile)**: Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the mixture. The α-protons of dimethyl malonate (between the two ester groups) are highly acidic. NaOEt will remove one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `[-]CH(COOMe)2`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile)**: Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The carbon-carbon double bond is activated by the electron-withdrawing ester group, making the β-carbon electrophilic.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`\n*   **Mechanism**: The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and then the carbonyl π-electrons shift to the oxygen to form an intermediate enolate. This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to give the final neutral product.\n    1.  **Attack**: `[-]CH(COOMe)2` attacks the β-carbon (`p-Tolyl-CH-`).\n    2.  **Bond Formation**: A new C-C bond forms between the carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    3.  **Protonation**: The α-carbon gets a proton from the solvent.\n*   **Product (A) Structure**: The structure of the product is `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)2)-CH2-COOMe`.\n*   **Matching with Options**: We need to identify which of the given names corresponds to this structure.\n    *   The options distinguish between two isomers based on the position of the `p-tolyl` group relative to the ester groups on a \"propane-tricarboxylate\" skeleton.\n    *   **Structure from options B/C**: `trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate`. Let's analyze the connectivity: `p-tolyl-CH2 - CH(COOMe) - CH(COOMe)2`. This would be the result of the malonate nucleophile attacking the α-carbon of the acrylate, which is not a Michael addition.\n    *   **Structure from options A/D**: `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`. Let's analyze the connectivity: `(MeOOC)2CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH2COOMe`. This structure matches the one we derived from the correct Michael addition mechanism (β-attack).\n*   **Conclusion for A**: Product A is `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n**Part 2: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reactants**: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`), followed by acidic workup (MeOH, H3O+).\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition using an enamine as the nucleophile (a process often part of the Stork enamine alkylation).\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile)**: The enamine, `1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine`, is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. It acts as a neutral, \"pre-formed\" enolate equivalent. The nucleophilic carbon is the one β to the nitrogen atom (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile)**: (E)-but-2-enenitrile is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (`CH3-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`).\n*   **Mechanism**: The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium ion. The subsequent acidic workup (H3O+) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone.\n*   **Product (B) Structure**: The net result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at its α-position. The group added is derived from the Michael acceptor. The `CH3-CH=CH-CN` fragment becomes a `-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN` substituent. The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with this substituent at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The systematic name for this product is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.\n*   **Matching with Options**:\n    *   **Options A/D**: `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. This matches our derived product, which is in its stable keto form.\n    *   **Options B/C**: `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`. This is the enol tautomer of the product. The keto form is generally more stable and is considered the major final product unless conditions specifically favor the enol.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: Product B is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. This is consistent with options A and D.\n\n**Part 3: Analyze Reaction C**\n\n*   **Reactants**: An unknown reactant C + but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Product**: 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition where we need to identify the donor. We can solve this using retrosynthesis (working backward from the product).\n*   **Retrosynthesis**: The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The parent structure is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The substituent at C2 is `-(CH2)-(CH2)-C(=O)CH3`, which is the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   This substituent is derived from the Michael acceptor, but-3-en-2-one (`CH2=CH-C(=O)CH3`). The reaction added a proton to the α-carbon and formed a bond at the β-carbon. This matches.\n    *   The C-C bond formed during the reaction is between C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring and the β-carbon of the MVK.\n    *   This implies that the nucleophile was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The protons at C2 of this molecule are exceptionally acidic, as they are located between two carbonyl groups.\n*   **Reactant C Structure**: The Michael donor, reactant C, must therefore be `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The base (KOH) deprotonates it at C2 to generate the nucleophile needed for the reaction.\n*   **Matching with Options**:\n    *   **Option A**: Reactant C is `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This is an incorrect starting material.\n    *   **Option D**: Reactant C is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This is the correct starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for C**: Reactant C is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A corresponds to the name in options A and D.\n*   Product B corresponds to the name in options A and D.\n*   Reactant C corresponds to the name in option D.\n\nTherefore, all three parts are correctly described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere's a breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. The α-carbon is `CH-COOCH₃` and the β-carbon is `p-Tolyl-CH`.\n*   **Base/Solvent:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH).\n\n**Mechanism:**\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The base, NaOEt, deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.\n3.  **Protonation:** The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final neutral product.\n\n**Product Structure Analysis:**\n*   The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n*   The atoms involved are: `(MeOOC)₂CH⁻` + `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe` → `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH⁻-COOMe`\n*   After protonation: `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`\n*   This structure needs to be named. Let's examine the options. The name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` can be constructed as follows:\n    *   **Propane chain:** `C1-C2-C3`\n    *   **Substituents:** Two `-COOMe` groups on C1, a `-p-tolyl` group on C2, and one `-COOMe` group on C3.\n    *   To satisfy valency, this forms the structure: `(MeOOC)₂CH(1)-CH(p-tolyl)(2)-CH₂(3)COOMe`.\n    *   This naming convention, where a COOMe group is part of the chain name, is not standard IUPAC practice for this type of molecule, but it describes the correct connectivity derived from the reaction mechanism. Thus, we accept this as product **A**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon relative to the nitrogen.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH) as a solvent and H₃O⁺ for workup.\n\n**Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n1.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n2.  **Intermediate Formation:** This forms a new C-C bond, resulting in an iminium ion on the cyclohexene ring and a carbanion on the nitrile part, which gets protonated by MeOH.\n3.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n**Product Structure Analysis:**\n*   The original cyclohexanone ring is recovered.\n*   A new substituent is added at the α-position (C2) of the cyclohexanone.\n*   The substituent is derived from butenenitrile: `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n*   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone. The systematic name is based on the longest chain, which is the butanenitrile chain. The `2-oxocyclohexyl` group is a substituent on the butanenitrile.\n*   The attachment is at carbon 3 of the butanenitrile chain: `CH₃-CH(substituent)-CH₂-CN`.\n*   Therefore, the product **B** is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. The keto form (`oxo`) is the stable product after hydrolysis, not the enol (`hydroxycyclohexenyl`).\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Reactant **C**\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** But-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n*   **Base/Solvent:** KOH in H₂O.\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\n**Mechanism (Retrosynthesis):**\n1.  **Identify the pieces:** The Michael addition connects a donor nucleophile to an acceptor. The part of the product derived from the acceptor (MVK) is `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, which is a `3-oxobutyl` group.\n2.  **Identify the donor:** The `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to C2 of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring. This means the original nucleophile was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The starting material **C** (the Michael donor) must be `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The protons on C2, located between the two carbonyl groups, are very acidic and are easily removed by KOH to form the nucleophilic enolate. The structure `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` is the standard representation of the keto form, even though it exists in equilibrium with its enol tautomer (`3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one`).\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions:\n\n### Reaction A:\n**dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants**:\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile)**: Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic proton on the α-carbon (the carbon between the two carbonyl groups) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: [⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂].\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile)**: Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the one attached to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition)**:\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is another enolate, [p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃], which is stabilized by resonance.\n    *   This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine Product (A)**:\n    *   The final product structure is p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃.\n    *   To name this using the \"propane-tricarboxylate\" system, we identify the main 3-carbon chain linking the carboxylate groups.\n    *   The structure can be seen as: (MeOOC)₂-C¹H - C²H(p-tolyl) - C³H₂-COOMe.\n    *   Numbering this chain C1-C2-C3, we have:\n        *   Two methyl carboxylate groups on C1.\n        *   A p-tolyl group on C2.\n        *   One methyl carboxylate group on C3.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n**1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants**:\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile)**: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a neutral enolate equivalent (a Stork enamine). The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine double bond (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile)**: (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH=CH-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation)**:\n    *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a new C-C bond.\n    *   The final step involves hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone) and protonates the piperidine, removing it from the molecule.\n\n3.  **Determine Product (B)**:\n    *   The starting enamine was formed from cyclohexanone. The reaction regenerates a ketone, so the product is a substituted cyclohexanone.\n    *   The substituent is attached at the α-position (C2) relative to the new carbonyl group.\n    *   The substituent is derived from the but-2-enenitrile: -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN group at C2.\n    *   The IUPAC name is based on the butanenitrile chain, with a (2-oxocyclohexyl) group at position 3. So the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, most stable product after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C:\n**C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the transformation**: We are given the product and need to identify the Michael donor (reactant C).\n    *   **Product**: 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This means a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring has a (3-oxobutyl) group, -CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃, attached at its C2 position.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃. In a Michael addition, this becomes the -CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃ group.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Reactant C)**: The reaction forms a C-C bond between the C2 of the dione and the β-carbon of MVK. This means the nucleophile was an enolate formed at the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. The proton at C2 is highly acidic as it is flanked by two carbonyl groups.\n\n2.  **Determine Reactant (C)**:\n    *   The nucleophile is generated by deprotonating reactant C with the base (KOH).\n    *   Since the core of the product is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, and the C2 position acted as the nucleophile, reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   **A**: trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B**: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C**: cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing this with the given options, we find that all three match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the acidic α-carbon between the two ester groups to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃.

This can be viewed as a substituted propane chain with three methyl carboxylate groups.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. Let's verify this name against the structure:\n        *   Propane chain: C1-C2-C3.\n        *   Two ester groups on C1 (`-CH(COOCH₃)₂`).\n        *   A p-tolyl group on C2.\n        *   An ester group on C3 (from `-CH₂-COOCH₃`).\n        *   The structure matches the name `(COOCH₃)₂CH(1) - CH(p-tolyl)(2) - CH₂(3)COOCH₃`.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, pre-formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. In the Stork enamine reaction, the enamine acts as the nucleophile. The nucleophilic carbon is the α-carbon of the parent ketone (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enamine's α-carbon attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium salt intermediate.\n    *   The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Identify the Product (B):**\n    *   The final product is cyclohexanone substituted at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The substituent added is derived from but-2-enenitrile. The new C-C bond forms between C2 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (C3) of the butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituent group is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The structure of the product is a cyclohexanone ring with the `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group attached at C2.\n    *   Naming this molecule based on the butanenitrile parent chain gives **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The acidic workup ensures the final product is the keto form, not the enol form.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and the Acceptor (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃.\n    *   The bond formed in a Michael addition is between the β-carbon of the acceptor and the α-carbon of the donor.\n    *   Upon reaction, the `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃` group becomes the `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-CO-CH₃` substituent, which is the `3-oxobutyl` group mentioned in the product name.\n    *   This means the fragment `2-(...)cyclohexane-1,3-dione` must have come from the Michael donor, reactant C.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reactant (C):**\n    *   The nucleophile in this reaction must be the enolate formed from the starting material C.

Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon of the original ketone (the C2 position of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH=CH-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (the one bonded to the methyl group) is the electrophilic site.\n    *   **Reagents:** The reaction is first run in a solvent like MeOH, followed by an acidic aqueous workup (H₃O⁺) to hydrolyze the intermediate.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Nucleophilic Attack):** The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The lone pair on the nitrogen atom moves to form a C=N⁺ double bond (an iminium ion), and the C=C double bond of the enamine performs the attack.\n    *   **Step 2 (Intermediate formation and protonation):** This forms an iminium ion intermediate with a newly formed C-C bond and a carbanion on the α-carbon of the nitrile. The carbanion is protonated (by MeOH) to give a substituted iminium salt.\n    *   **Step 3 (Hydrolysis):** The addition of H₃O⁺ hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone), regenerating the cyclohexanone structure and producing a protonated piperidine salt.\n\n3.  **Identify Product B:**\n    *   The reaction attaches the fragment from butenenitrile to the C2 position (α-position) of the cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   The butenenitrile fragment becomes `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone: 2-(-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN)cyclohexanone.\n    *   Let's find the correct name for this structure.

The product has a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` core and a `3-oxobutyl` side chain (`-CH₂CH₂C(=O)CH₃`) at position 2.\n        3.  The `3-oxobutyl` group comes from the Michael acceptor, but-3-en-2-one, after it accepts the nucleophile and gets protonated.\n        4.  Therefore, the nucleophile (Michael donor) must be the enolate of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` core.\n        5.  Reactant C is deprotonated by KOH at the highly acidic C2 position (between the two carbonyls) to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n        6.  This enolate then attacks the MVK to form the product.\n    *   **Identity of C:**\n        *   Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n        *   Option C states that C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n        *   Option D states that C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which is not the correct starting material.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n    *   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n    *   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination of reactants and products corresponds exactly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products of the given Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate (`CH₂(COOMe)₂`) and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOMe`).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH). NaOEt is a strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Michael Addition.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate has acidic α-protons (pKa ≈ 13) located on the carbon between the two ester groups. The base, NaOEt, deprotonates it to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, `⁻CH(COOMe)₂`. This is the nucleophile.\n\n    `CH₂(COOMe)₂ + NaOEt <=> [⁻CH(COOMe)₂]Na⁺ + EtOH`\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The presence of the electron-withdrawing ester group makes the C=C double bond electrophilic, particularly at the β-carbon.\n\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`\n\n3.  **Mechanism (1,4-Conjugate Addition):** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and then onto the carbonyl oxygen, forming another enolate intermediate. Subsequent protonation by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon yields the final product.\n\n    *   **Step 1 (Attack):** `⁻CH(COOMe)₂` attacks `p-Tolyl-CH(β)`.\n    *   **Step 2 (Intermediate):** `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂)-CH=C(O⁻)OMe` (enolate) is formed.\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The enolate is protonated by EtOH at the α-carbon.\n\n4.  **Final Product (A):** The final structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n\n    *   **Naming the Product:** This is a tricarboxylic acid ester. The most systematic IUPAC name can be complex. However, we can use a common naming convention based on a propane chain. Let's consider the 3-carbon chain connecting the carboxyl groups: `C(malonate)-C(β)-C(α)`.\n        *   C1: The original malonate carbon, `-CH-`, is bonded to two `-COOMe` groups.\n        *   C2: The original β-carbon, `-CH-`, is bonded to a `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   C3: The original α-carbon, `-CH₂-`, is bonded to one `-COOMe` group.\n    *   Numbering this chain from C1 to C3: `(MeOOC)₂-C1H - C2H(p-tolyl) - C3H₂-COOMe`. Wait, this seems wrong. Let's number from the other end.\n    *   Numbering the propane backbone as C1(α)-C2(β)-C3(malonate):\n        *   C1(-CH₂-) is attached to a `-COOMe` group.\n        *   C2(-CH-) is attached to a `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   C3(-CH-) is attached to two `-COOMe` groups.\n    *   In this polycarboxylic acid naming system, the carbons of the `COOH` groups are not part of the main chain. So the main chain is propane. The carboxylate groups are at positions 1, 3, and 3. `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,3,3-tricarboxylate`. This doesn't match the options.\n    *   Let's try numbering the longest chain containing C(malonate), C(beta) and C(alpha): C1(malonate)-C2(beta)-C3(alpha). `C1H(COOMe)₂ - C2H(p-tolyl) - C3H₂COOMe`. If this is named as substituted methyl propanoate, it would be `methyl 2-[bis(methoxycarbonyl)methyl]-3-(p-tolyl)propanoate`.\n    *   Let's analyze the name provided in option A: `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`. This name implies a propane chain (C1-C2-C3) with two carboxylate groups at C1 and one at C3. A `p-tolyl` group is at C2. Structure: `(MeOOC)₂C1-C2H(p-tolyl)-C3H₂-COOMe`. This structure can be formed if the Michael donor `CH(COOMe)₂` attacks the β-carbon `CH(p-tolyl)`. Let's assume the hydrogen from malonate is also lost (e.g., through oxidation) which is not supported by the reaction condition.\n    *   Let's re-examine our product structure: `(MeOOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂-COOMe`. Let the chain be C(alpha)-C(beta)-C(malonate), numbering as C1-C2-C3. The substituents are: one COOMe at C1, a p-tolyl at C2, and two COOMe groups at C3. This leads to `...-propane-1,3,3-tricarboxylate`. This is still not matching.\n    *   There must be an unconventional naming or a mistake in the options' names. Let's retrace the connection points which are unambiguous: malonate `C` connects to acrylate `β-C`. Product is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂(α)-COOMe`. Comparing `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` with `trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate`, the former corresponds to a `1,4` Michael adduct, while the latter would correspond to a `1,2` adduct to the carbonyl group which is incorrect. So, despite the possibly confusing name, `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` represents the correct connectivity for the Michael addition product.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`).\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH) as solvent, followed by aqueous acid workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Stork Enamine Synthesis (a variant of Michael Addition).\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nitrogen's lone pair increases the electron density of the double bond, making the β-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring) nucleophilic.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site. `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n\n3.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Attack):** The nucleophilic C2 of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    *   **Step 2 (Hydrolysis):** The aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt. The C=N⁺ bond is cleaved and converted back into a carbonyl group (C=O), regenerating the ketone. Piperidine is liberated as piperidinium ion.\n\n4.  **Final Product (B):** The result is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2) with the fragment from the nitrile. The added fragment is `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   **Product Structure:** 2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n    *   **Naming the Product:** The molecule can be named as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is the 4-carbon nitrile: `C4H₃-C3H-C2H₂-C1N`. At C3, a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group is attached. Therefore, the name is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. The hydrolysis step ensures the final product is the ketone, not the enol or enamine.\n\n### Reaction C\n\n*   **Reactants:** An unknown compound **C** and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK, `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`).\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water (H₂O).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Michael Addition (in reverse).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product:** The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The substituent at position 2 is a `3-oxobutyl` group (`-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reactants:** One reactant is the Michael acceptor, but-3-en-2-one (`CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`). After the reaction, this becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` side chain. The bond is formed at the β-carbon.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C (Michael Donor):** The reaction forms a bond between the donor's nucleophilic carbon and the acceptor's β-carbon.\n    *   In the product, the `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to C2 of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The methylene protons at C2 of this dione are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 5) because they are flanked by two carbonyl groups. The base KOH easily deprotonates it.\n    *   So, reactant **C** must be `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **A:** The product is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   **B:** The product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   **C:** The reactant is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   **A) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n*   B) A = ..., B = ..., C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (enol tautomer)\n*   C) A = ... 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate (wrong adduct), B = ... (enol form), C = ... (enol form)\n*   D) A = ... 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate (wrong adduct), B = ... (enol form), C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nOption A correctly identifies all three species according to the standard representations and outcomes of these reactions.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile Source):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH2(COOCH3)2`. The two hydrogens on the central carbon (α-hydrogens) are highly acidic because the resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by resonance with both adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Base:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that deprotonates the dimethyl malonate to form the nucleophilic enolate: `Na+ [CH(COOCH3)2]−`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tol-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH3`, where `p-Tol` is a p-tolyl group (a benzene ring substituted with a methyl group at the para position). The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Enolate formation:** `CH2(COOCH3)2 + NaOEt → Na+ [CH(COOCH3)2]− + EtOH`\n    *   **Step 2: Michael Addition:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The π electrons from the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, and then onto the carbonyl oxygen, forming a new, resonance-stabilized enolate.\n        *   `p-Tol-CH(β)=CH-COOCH3 + [CH(COOCH3)2]− → p-Tol-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH=C(O−)OCH3` (one resonance form of the intermediate enolate).\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation:** The intermediate enolate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final, stable product.\n        *   `p-Tol-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-C−H-COOCH3 + EtOH → p-Tol-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH2-COOCH3 + EtO−`\n\n3.  **Identify Product A:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `(CH3OOC)2CH-CH(p-Tol)-CH2-COOCH3`.\n    *   Let's name this compound based on the options. The name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` describes a propane chain `(C3-C2-C1)` with substituents.\n        *   At C1: Two methoxycarbonyl (`-COOCH3`) groups.\n        *   At C2: One p-tolyl group.\n        *   At C3: One methoxycarbonyl group.\n        *   Let's build this structure: `(CH3OOC)-CH2(C3)-CH(p-Tol)(C2)-CH(COOCH3)2(C1)`.\n    *   This structure matches our derived product. Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which is a variant of the Michael addition. The enamine acts as the Michael donor.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH3-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n    *   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is followed by an acidic workup (`H3O+`).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and generates an iminium ion intermediate and a carbanion stabilized by the nitrile group.\n    *   **Step 2: Protonation:** The carbanion is protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n    *   **Step 3: Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (`H3O+`) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a ketone. The overall result is the alkylation of the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone).\n\n3.  **Identify Product B:**\n    *   The starting ketone is cyclohexanone. The alkylating agent is derived from `CH3-CH=CH-CN`.\n    *   The group added to the α-carbon (C2) of cyclohexanone is `-CH(CH3)-CH2CN`.\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n    *   Let's name this product: The principal functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`), which has higher priority than a ketone. The main chain is a butanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile: `N≡C(1)-C(2)H2-C(3)H(subst.)-C(4)H3`.\n    *   The substituent at C3 is the `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    *   Therefore, the name is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.\n    *   The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, is the enol tautomer. Under acidic hydrolysis conditions, the keto form is the major, stable product.\n    *   Thus, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### **Reaction 3: (C)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where we need to identify the starting Michael donor (C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH2=CH-COCH3`.\n    *   **Base:** KOH in water.\n\n2.  **Determine Reactant C using Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   \"Break\" the molecule at the bond formed during the Michael addition. This is the bond between the Michael donor and the Michael acceptor.\n    *   The fragment from the acceptor (MVK) is the `3-oxobutyl` group (`-CH2-CH2-COCH3`). This group comes from the addition to `CH2(β)=CH(α)-COCH3`, where a nucleophile adds to the β-carbon and a proton adds to the α-carbon.\n    *   The bond is formed between C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Therefore, the Michael donor (reactant C) must be the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` part.\n    *   The hydrogens at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic (they are α to two carbonyl groups) and are readily removed by the base (KOH) to form a highly stabilized enolate, which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C:**\n    *   Based on the retrosynthesis, reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nComparing this with the given options, we find that option A matches all three results.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the three reactions to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of the base sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, `[:CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. Its structure is `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center for the Michael addition.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    2.  This forms a new C-C bond between the malonate carbon and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    3.  The intermediate is an enolate, `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - [:CH-COOCH₃]⁻`.\n    4.  Protonation of this enolate at the α-carbon by the solvent (EtOH) yields the final product.\n*   **Product A Structure:** The resulting structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Product A Name:** To name this compound using the IUPAC nomenclature provided in the options, we can consider it as a substituted propane tricarboxylate. The main three-carbon chain is `C(from malonate) — C(β from acrylate) — C(α from acrylate)`.\n    *   Let's number this chain: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)-CH₂(3)`.\n    *   This gives a propane skeleton.\n    *   There are two methyl carboxylate (`-COOCH₃`) groups on C1 and one on C3. Thus, it's a propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n    *   There is a p-tolyl group on C2.\n    *   Therefore, the full name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   This reaction is a Stork enamine synthesis, which functions as a Michael addition.\n*   **Nucleophile:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 of the original cyclohexene ring).\n*   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), which has the structure `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The nucleophilic carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    2.  This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    3.  The addition of H₃O⁺ in the second step serves to hydrolyze the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n*   **Product B Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring where the α-carbon (C2) is substituted with the alkyl group from the but-2-enenitrile. The attacking carbon from the enamine is the one that becomes the α-carbon to the resulting ketone. The substituent is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n*   **Product B Name:** The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the compound is named as a derivative of butanenitrile. The carbon chain is `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`. A `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group is attached at position 3.\n    *   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is favored over the enol form after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   This is a retrosynthesis problem where we are given the product and one reactant and asked to find the other reactant (C).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Let's break down this structure.\n    *   The main structure is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   At position 2, there is a `-(3-oxobutyl)` substituent: `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). Its structure is `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`.\n*   **Analysis:** In a Michael addition, a C-C bond is formed between the nucleophile and the β-carbon of the acceptor. In our product, the `(3-oxobutyl)` group, `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, is derived from MVK after the double bond has been reduced by the addition reaction. The bond to the main ring is at the position of the former β-carbon. This is consistent with a Michael addition.\n*   **Reactant C (Michael Donor):** The rest of the molecule must have come from the Michael donor. This is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring, with the new bond formed at the C2 position. The proton at C2 of a 1,3-dione is highly acidic and is easily removed by a base (like KOH) to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Therefore, reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. Although it exists predominantly in its enol form (`3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one`), it is conventionally named and represented in reaction schemes as the diketone. Naming it as the diketone is also consistent with the naming of the product.\n\n### Summary:\n*   **Product A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **Product B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **Reactant C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination of answers matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon (the CH₂ group between the two ester groups) to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation.\n*   **Mechanism (1,4-Conjugate Addition):**\n    1.  The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    2.  This forms a new C-C bond and a new enolate intermediate: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃`.\n    3.  This intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to give the final neutral product.\n*   **Product Structure (A):** The final product is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Product Name (A):** This structure can be named as a substituted propane tricarboxylate. The main chain consists of the α-carbon of the malonate and the β- and α-carbons of the original acrylate double bond. This gives a three-carbon backbone. Numbering it C1-C2-C3 from the malonate end gives C1 having two ester groups, C2 having the p-tolyl group, and C3 (as part of a -CH₂-COOMe group) having one ester group. This corresponds to the name **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which proceeds via a Michael addition mechanism.\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, a neutral nitrogen analog of an enolate. The nucleophilic carbon is the one β to the nitrogen atom (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile, forming a C-C bond and an intermediate iminium salt.\n    2.  The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group.\n*   **Product Structure (B):** The reaction results in a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2). The added substituent is derived from the but-2-enenitrile and has the structure `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`. The keto form of the product is more stable than the enol form and is considered the major final product after an acidic workup.\n*   **Product Name (B):** According to IUPAC nomenclature, the nitrile group has higher priority than the ketone. Thus, the parent chain is butanenitrile. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain. The name for this substituent is `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`. Therefore, the full name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a retrosynthesis problem to identify the Michael donor (reactant C).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone or MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  The Michael reaction forms a C-C bond between the nucleophilic α-carbon of the donor and the electrophilic β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    2.  In the product, the `(3-oxobutyl)` group, which has the structure `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`, came from the MVK acceptor (`CH₂(β)=CH-CO-CH₃`). The bond to the donor is at the β-carbon position.\n    3.  This means the nucleophile must be the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety, connected at the C2 position.\n*   **Reactant C Structure:** The starting material C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The protons on C2 are flanked by two carbonyl groups, making them highly acidic. The base (KOH) deprotonates this position to form the stabilized enolate that acts as the nucleophile.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nLet's consolidate the findings and compare with the options:\n*   **Product A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **Product B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **Reactant C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis specific combination is presented in option D.\n\n*   A) A=correct, B=correct, C=incorrect (lists the enol tautomer's hydrate/wrong structure)\n*   B) A=incorrect, B=incorrect, C=incorrect\n*   C) A=incorrect, B=incorrect, C=correct\n*   D) A=correct, B=correct, C=correct\n\nThe analysis of all three reactions confirms that the reactants and products listed in option D are correct. Many of the provided answers reach the same conclusion after a thorough chemical analysis.\n\n<<<D>>>"

In the presence of a base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The p-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt <=> [CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻ Na⁺ + EtOH`\n    2.  **Michael Addition (Nucleophilic Attack):** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n        `[CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻ + p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃ → (MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃`\n    3.  **Protonation:** The resulting enolate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n        `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃ + EtOH → (MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n*   **Product A Identification:**\n    *   The structure of the product is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this compound as a tricarboxylate derivative of propane, we can consider the three-carbon chain formed by the malonate carbon, the β-carbon, and the α-carbon of the original acrylate.\n        *   Let C1 be the carbon from the malonate, which is attached to two `-COOCH₃` groups.\n        *   Let C2 be the β-carbon, which is attached to the `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   Let C3 be the α-carbon, which is now part of a `-CH₂-COOCH₃` moiety.\n    *   The structure can be seen as `(MeOOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)(p-tolyl)-CH₂(3)COOCH₃`.\n    *   This is an ester of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid. The substituent is a `p-tolyl` group at position 2.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are excellent Michael donors. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n*   **Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    1.  **Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and results in an iminium ion intermediate.\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The reaction mixture is treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone).\n*   **Product B Identification:**\n    *   The initial addition places the `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group onto the cyclohexene ring at the position that was β to the nitrogen.\n    *   After hydrolysis, the enamine part reverts to a cyclohexanone. The substituent is at the α-position (C2) relative to the new carbonyl group.\n    *   The product structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at C2.\n    *   To name the product, we can consider it a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is the four-carbon nitrile.\n        *   `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`\n    *   The substituent is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group attached to C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is generally the minor product compared to the more stable keto form after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (commonly known as methyl vinyl ketone or MVK), `CH₂=CH-COCH₃`.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Reactant C.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   This is a Michael addition reaction where reactant C acts as the nucleophile. The reaction is done in the presence of base (KOH).\n    *   The product is formed by adding a fragment from the Michael acceptor to the Michael donor. The fragment added from MVK (`CH₂=CH-COCH₃`) to the donor is `-CH₂-CH₂-COCH₃`, which is the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   The product structure shows that this `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to C2 of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n    *   This implies that the Michael donor (reactant C) must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The proton at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is very acidic because it's located between two carbonyl groups. The base (KOH) deprotonates this carbon to form a highly stabilized enolate, which then attacks the MVK.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis set of reactants and products corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the three reactions to determine the reactants and major final products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of the strong base sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-hydrogen (between the two carbonyl groups) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a conjugate addition.\n    1.  `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃  →  p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃`\n    2.  The resulting enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to give the final neutral product.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃ + EtOH  →  p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n*   **Product A Structure:** The final product is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n*   **Product A Name:** To name this compound using the system in the options, we identify a propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid core. The structure is the trimethyl ester of 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid. Therefore, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 of the original cyclohexanone ring). This reaction is a Stork enamine alkylation, a type of Michael addition.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a carbanion stabilized by the nitrile group.\n    2.  The subsequent acidic workup (`H₃O⁺`) has two functions: it hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (regenerating the ketone) and protonates the carbanion.\n*   **Product B Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2) with the group derived from but-2-enenitrile. The added group is `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`. So the product is 2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Product B Name:** This molecule is named as a substituted butanenitrile. The butanenitrile chain is `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-`. The substituent on C3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group. Thus, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the more stable tautomer and is considered the major final product.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a reverse problem. We are given the product and one reactant (the Michael acceptor) and need to find the other reactant (the Michael donor, C).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (also known as methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n*   **Analysis:** In a Michael addition, a nucleophile adds to the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated system. For MVK, the nucleophile adds to the terminal `CH₂` group.\n    `Nu⁻ + CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃ → Nu-CH₂-⁻CH-C(=O)CH₃`\n    After protonation, this gives `Nu-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`.\n*   **Identifying Reactant C:** The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The substituent at the C2 position is the `-(3-oxobutyl)` group, which is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`. This matches the fragment added from MVK. Therefore, the nucleophile (`Nu⁻`) must be the enolate of the remaining part of the molecule, which is the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic C2 proton of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Reactant C:** The starting material C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   Product A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   Product B is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)\n*   B) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (**Correct**)\n*   C) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect A, B, and C)\n*   D) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect A and B)\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), is strong enough to deprotonate the acidic α-carbon (the CH₂ group flanked by two ester groups), forming a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The electrophilic site for Michael addition is the β-carbon. The carbonyl carbon is C=O, the adjacent carbon is α, and the next one is β. So, the structure is `p-tolyl-CβH=CαH-COOCH₃`.\n3.  **The Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons from the C=C bond shift to form an enolate intermediate, which is then protonated by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent.\n    *   **Attack:** `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon.\n    *   **Intermediate Formation & Protonation:** `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - C⁻H-COOCH₃` is formed, which is quickly protonated by EtOH to give `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n4.  **Name the Product (A):** The product structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this using the options' systematic nomenclature, we can consider it a derivative of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid, which has the backbone `(HOOC)₂CH-CH₂-CH₂COOH`.\n    *   Our product has a `p-tolyl` group substituting a hydrogen on the central carbon (C2).\n    *   So, the parent acid is 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid.\n    *   The final product is the trimethyl ester of this acid.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, which serves as a nucleophile. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon relative to the nitrogen atom (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This is part of the Stork enamine synthesis.\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The electrophilic β-carbon is the one attached to the methyl group: `CH₃-CβH=CαH-CN`.\n3.  **The Reaction:** The nucleophilic carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate. The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) first protonates the intermediate anion and then hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone.\n    *   **Attack & Intermediate:** The enamine attacks the nitrile, forming a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone) and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   **Hydrolysis:** The `H₃O⁺` workup converts the enamine functionality back to a carbonyl group.\n4.  **Identify the Product (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a substituent at the C2 position (α to the carbonyl). The substituent is derived from the but-2-enenitrile acceptor: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The full structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at position 2.\n    *   Naming this compound as a substituted butanenitrile: The main chain is the four-carbon nitrile. There is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group attached to carbon 3 of the nitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Acceptor (Retro-Michael Reaction):** This is a retrosynthesis problem. We need to identify reactant C.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`. The β-carbon is the `CH₂` group.\n2.  **Identify the Bond Formed:** The Michael addition forms a bond between the nucleophile and the β-carbon of the acceptor. In the product, the `(3-oxobutyl)` group, `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`, comes from MVK. The bond must have formed at the terminal `CH₂` of this group.\n3.  **Identify the Michael Donor (C):** The rest of the molecule must have been the nucleophile (Michael donor). This is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety, connected at C2.\n    *   Cyclohexane-1,3-dione has highly acidic protons on the C2 carbon, as this carbon is located between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   The base, KOH, will deprotonate C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to form a stable enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as the nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Therefore, reactant **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon (the carbon atom of the double bond further from the ester group) is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Mechanism (Conjugate Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to form another enolate intermediate.\n    *   This second enolate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (A):**\n    The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    The resulting structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n\n4.  **Naming Product A:**\n    To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional groups (the three methyl ester groups). This is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n    *   The propane chain is `C1 - C2 - C3`.\n    *   We number the chain to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the malonate end:\n        *   C1 has two `-COOCH₃` groups.\n        *   C2 has a `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   C3 has one `-COOCH₃` group (it's attached to C3 via a CH₂).\n    Let's re-verify the structure and name. The structure is `(MeOOC)₂C¹H-C²H(p-tolyl)-C³H₂-COOMe`.\n    The IUPAC name is based on a propane main chain with three carboxylate groups.\n    The propane chain is `C¹-C²-C³`. The substituents are attached as follows: `(MeOOC)₂-CH¹ - CH²(p-tolyl) - CH₂³-COOMe`.\n    Numbering from the right side gives the principal groups at positions 1, 3, 3, and the p-tolyl at 2. Numbering from the left gives the principal groups at 1,1,3 and the p-tolyl at 2. The set (1,1,3) is lower than (1,3,3).\n    So, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nitrogen analogs of enols and are excellent nucleophiles. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the original enone system, which is C2 of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium ion.\n    *   The reaction is worked up with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). The acid hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Product Structure (B):**\n    *   A cyclohexanone ring is regenerated.\n    *   A new substituent is attached at the C2 position (the α-carbon to the carbonyl).\n    *   The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group at C2.\n\n4.  **Naming Product B:**\n    We can name this compound in two ways, but we will choose the one presented in the options. Naming the butanenitrile as the parent chain:\n    *   The parent chain is butanenitrile: `NC-C¹H₂-C²H₂-C³H-C⁴H₃`.\n    *   The substituent is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   Looking at our product structure, `(2-oxocyclohexyl)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`, the substituent is attached to C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, more stable tautomer compared to the enol form.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants from Product (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Unknown Reactant (Michael Donor):** C.\n\n2.  **Analysis:**\n    *   A Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The `(3-oxobutyl)` group in the product, `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, comes from MVK (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`) after it has been attacked at its β-carbon (`CH₂=`) and protonated.\n    *   This means the bond was formed between the C2 of the dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of the remaining part of the molecule, which is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n\n3.  **Verifying the Forward Reaction:**\n    *   Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic methylene protons at C2 (located between two carbonyls) to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    *   This enolate attacks the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Subsequent protonation yields the product, `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This confirms C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of reactants and products matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Step 1: Formation of the Nucleophile (Michael Donor).**\n    Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate. This carbon is particularly acidic because its conjugate base (the enolate) is stabilized by resonance across two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    `CH2(COOMe)2 + NaOEt <=> [Na]⁺[⁻CH(COOMe)2] + EtOH`\n    The nucleophile is the malonate enolate, `⁻CH(COOMe)2`.\n*   **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack (Michael Addition).**\n    The Michael acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`. The nucleophile attacks the electrophilic β-carbon.\n    The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon, and the π electrons shift to form a new enolate intermediate.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe + ⁻CH(COOMe)2 → p-Tolyl-CH(β)(CH(COOMe)2)-C⁻H(α)-COOMe`\n*   **Step 3: Protonation.**\n    The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final neutral product (A).\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)2)-C⁻H-COOMe + EtOH → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)2)-CH2-COOMe + EtO⁻`\n*   **Step 4: Naming the Product (A).**\n    The structure of the product is `(MeOOC)2CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH2-COOMe`.\n    Let's analyze the names provided in the options, which use a common (non-systematic IUPAC) \"propane-tricarboxylate\" nomenclature.\n    -   `propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` refers to a three-carbon chain with two carboxylate groups on C1 and one on C3: `(MeOOC)2CH-CH2-CH2-COOMe`.\n    -   Placing a `p-tolyl` group at the C2 position gives `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    -   The structure for this name is `(MeOOC)2CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH2-COOMe`.\n    -   This structure exactly matches the product we derived from the reaction mechanism.\n    Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, followed by workup with MeOH and H3O⁺.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which involves a Michael addition of an enamine followed by hydrolysis.\n*   **Step 1: Formation and Reaction of the Nucleophile.**\n    1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral but strongly nucleophilic at their β-carbon (the carbon that was the α-carbon of the original ketone). This enamine acts as the Michael donor.\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition.**\n    The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`). The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n*   **Step 3: Protonation and Hydrolysis.**\n    The intermediate is protonated and then hydrolyzed by the acidic workup (H3O⁺). Hydrolysis of the iminium ion regenerates the ketone (cyclohexanone). The overall result is the addition of the butenenitrile-derived group to the α-carbon of cyclohexanone.\n*   **Step 4: Identifying the Product (B).**\n    -   The bond forms between the α-carbon of cyclohexanone (C2) and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    -   The fragment from but-2-enenitrile, after addition and protonation, is `-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n    -   This group is attached to C2 of the cyclohexanone ring.\n    -   The final product is a substituted cyclohexanone. To name it, we can treat the butanenitrile as the parent chain.\n    -   Parent chain: butanenitrile (`NC-C1-C2-C3-C4`).\n    -   The structure is `NC-CH2-CH(cyclohexanone)-CH3`. Numbering from the nitrile group (`CN` is C1), the substituent is at C3. The substituent is the `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    -   Thus, the product name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The acidic workup ensures the final product is the keto form, not the enol form (`3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`).\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** An unknown compound C and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition, but we need to identify one of the starting materials (a retro-synthesis problem).\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure.**\n    The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    -   The `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` is the six-membered ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3.\n    -   The `(3-oxobutyl)` group has the structure `-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    -   This group is attached at the C2 position of the dione ring, which is the acidic carbon located between the two carbonyls.\n*   **Step 2: Deconstruct the Michael Addition.**\n    A Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    -   The acceptor is given as but-3-en-2-one (MVK): `CH2(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    -   After the reaction, this fragment becomes `-CH2(β)-CH2(α)-C(=O)-CH3`, which is precisely the `(3-oxobutyl)` group in the product.\n    -   This means the bond was formed between the C2 of the donor ring and the β-carbon (CH2) of MVK.\n*   **Step 3: Identify Reactant C.**\n    The donor must be the molecule that provides the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` part. The reaction is carried out in base (KOH), which deprotonates the most acidic proton. The C2 proton of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is highly acidic and readily forms an enolate, which is a potent Michael donor.\n    Therefore, reactant **C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A** is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   **B** is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   **C** is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nThis set of reactants and products corresponds exactly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(CO₂Me)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, ⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-CO₂Me.\n*   **Reaction:** The nucleophilic enolate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a conjugate (or 1,4-) addition.\n    1.  **Attack:** The ⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂ carbanion attacks the β-carbon. The π electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and the π electrons of the C=O bond shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n        `p-Tolyl-CH(β)(CH(CO₂Me)₂) - CH(α)=C(O⁻)OMe`\n    2.  **Protonation:** This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final, stable product.\n        `p-Tolyl-CH(β)(CH(CO₂Me)₂) - CH₂(α)-CO₂Me`\n*   **Product A Naming:** Let's determine the IUPAC name for the product: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂) - CH₂-CO₂Me`.\n    We can identify a three-carbon chain as the main backbone, with carboxylate groups attached.\n    ` (MeO₂C)CH₂ - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH(CO₂Me)₂ `\n    Let's number this propane chain: `(MeO₂C)C³H₂ - C²H(p-Tolyl) - C¹H(CO₂Me)₂`\n    - The main chain is propane.\n    - There are three methyl carboxylate groups, making it a `trimethyl ... tricarboxylate`.\n    - The carboxylate groups are at positions 1, 1, and 3. So it is a `propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    - There is a p-tolyl substituent at position 2.\n    - The full name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, a nitrogen analog of an enol. Enamines are excellent nucleophiles at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This type of Michael addition is known as the Stork enamine alkylation.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN.\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  **Attack:** The nucleophilic C2 of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an iminium ion intermediate.\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (a ketone) at C1 of the cyclohexane ring. The piperidine is removed.\n*   **Product B:** The resulting product is a cyclohexanone ring with a substituent at the C2 position. The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`.\n    The structure is `2-(-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN)cyclohexan-1-one`.\n*   **Product B Naming:** According to IUPAC rules, the nitrile group (CN) has higher priority than the ketone. Therefore, the main chain is butanenitrile.\n    `CN¹-C²H₂-C³H(substituent)-C⁴H₃`\n    The substituent at C3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    The full name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is thermodynamically more stable than the enol form, so it is the major final product.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   This is a \"retrosynthesis\" problem where we need to identify the starting material C.\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** In a Michael addition, the donor adds to the β-carbon of the acceptor. After the addition and protonation, the MVK molecule becomes the `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-CO-CH₃` group, which is the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n*   The product shows that this `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to the C2 position of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring. The C-C bond was formed between C2 of the ring and the β-carbon of MVK.\n*   Therefore, the Michael donor (reactant C) must have been **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic C2 position (located between two carbonyls) to generate the nucleophilic enolate that initiates the attack on MVK.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of reactants and products matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants**: Dimethyl malonate (`CH₂(COOMe)₂`) + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOMe`)\n*   **Reagents**: NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) as a base, EtOH (ethanol) as a solvent.\n*   **Type of Reaction**: Michael Addition.\n\n1.  **Formation of Nucleophile (Michael Donor)**: The base, sodium ethoxide (EtO⁻), is strong enough to deprotonate the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, which is highly acidic due to the two adjacent ester groups. This forms a resonance-stabilized enolate ion.\n    `CH₂(COOMe)₂ + NaOEt ⇌ Na⁺ ⁻CH(COOMe)₂ + EtOH`\n\n2.  **Michael Addition**: The malonate enolate is a \"soft\" nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester (methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate). The α,β-unsaturated system is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`.\n    The nucleophile `⁻CH(COOMe)₂` attacks the β-carbon. This breaks the C=C π-bond, and the electrons move to form a new enolate intermediate.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOMe + ⁻CH(COOMe)₂ → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) -⁻CH-COOMe`\n\n3.  **Protonation**: The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final neutral product.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) -⁻CH-COOMe + EtOH → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) -CH₂-COOMe + EtO⁻`\n\n4.  **Product A Structure**: The final product is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂COOMe`.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A**: The IUPAC name for this structure is `trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)butane-1,1,4-tricarboxylate`. However, this name is not present in the options. The options provide names based on a propane chain, which are not strictly correct according to IUPAC rules for this structure. Let's analyze the names given in the options later and proceed to the other reactions.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants**: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`)\n*   **Reagents**: MeOH (methanol) as solvent, followed by aqueous acid workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Type of Reaction**: Stork Enamine Alkylation (a variation of the Michael Addition).\n\n1.  **Nucleophile (Michael Donor)**: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C=C carbon not attached to nitrogen).\n\n2.  **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor)**: (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (`CH₃-CH=`) is the electrophilic site for Michael addition.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an iminium ion intermediate.\n\n4.  **Hydrolysis**: The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone). The nitrile group is stable to these conditions and remains.\n\n5.  **Product B Structure**: The reaction attaches the butanenitrile fragment to the α-carbon of the original cyclohexanone. The substituent is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`. The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with this substituent at the 2-position.\n\n6.  **Naming Product B**: The product is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. This matches the name for product B in options A and D. The names in options B and C describe an enol, which is not the major product after acidic workup. Thus, options B and C can be eliminated.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants**: Reactant C + but-3-en-2-one (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`, methyl vinyl ketone or MVK).\n*   **Reagents**: KOH (potassium hydroxide), H₂O.\n*   **Product**: 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Type of Reaction**: Michael Addition.\n\n1.  **Analyzing the Product**: The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` is the main ring system.\n    *   The `(3-oxobutyl)` group is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   This substituent is located at the C2 position of the dione ring.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthesis**: We can deduce the reactants by mentally reversing the Michael addition. The bond formed is between the nucleophilic carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The acceptor is MVK (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`). After addition, it becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` (3-oxobutyl) group.\n    *   This means the Michael donor must be the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic C2-proton (located between the two carbonyls) to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the MVK.\n\n3.  **Reactant C Identity**: Therefore, reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **Product B** is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. This eliminates options B and C.\n*   **Reactant C** is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This eliminates option D, which lists C as `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione` (an unstable tautomer not typically referred to as the starting material).\n\nThis leaves **Option A** as the only possible answer.\n\nLet's re-examine Product A's name in Option A: `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`. As determined earlier, this name corresponds to the structure `(MeOOC)CH₂-CH(p-tolyl)-CH(COOMe)₂`, which is not the direct product of the given reaction. There is an error in the name provided in the question's options. However, since the other parts of option A (Product B and Reactant C) are correct, we choose A as the best fit.\n\nFinal check of Option A:\n*   A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate (Incorrect name, but we proceed by elimination)\n*   B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile (Correct)\n*   C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Correct)\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n**Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n**Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH)\n**Reaction Type:** Michael Addition\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleophile (Michael Donor):** Sodium ethoxide is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate.

In the presence of a base (NaOEt), it gets deprotonated to form a nucleophilic enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The carbon atoms are numbered starting from the carbonyl group, so the structure is `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), removes an acidic α-proton from dimethyl malonate to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n    2.  The malonate enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the methyl acrylate derivative.\n    3.  A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. This creates a new enolate intermediate: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃`.\n    4.  This enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n*   **Product Structure (A):**\n    The final product has the structure `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Naming the Product:**\n    Let's analyze the names provided in the options. The IUPAC naming of this complex molecule can be tricky.\n    Let's analyze the name from option A: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n    *   The parent chain is propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. This corresponds to a propane chain (`C₃-C₂-C₁`) with carboxylate groups at C1 (two of them) and C3 (one of them).\n    *   The structure of the parent trimethyl ester is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-C₂H₂-C₃H₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   A `p-tolyl` group is placed at the C2 position.\n    *   This gives the structure: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    This structure matches the product derived from the reaction mechanism. Therefore, this name correctly identifies product A.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nitrogen analogs of enols and are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 position of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile, also known as crotononitrile, `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which proceeds via a Michael-type addition.\n    2.  The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    3.  This forms an iminium salt intermediate.\n    4.  The reaction mixture is then treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This workup step hydrolyzes the iminium salt back into a ketone. The enamine functionality essentially serves to activate the α-position of the original ketone (cyclohexanone) for nucleophilic attack.\n*   **Product Structure (B):**\n    The final product is a cyclohexanone ring where the α-carbon (C2) is substituted with the remnant of the Michael acceptor. The acceptor `CH₃-CH=CH-CN` becomes the group `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` upon addition.\n    The product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone: `2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexanone`.\n*   **Naming the Product:**\n    The product can be named as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is `butanenitrile`. A `2-oxocyclohexyl` group is attached to C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name in the options, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, describes the enol tautomer. Under acidic workup, the more stable keto form is the major product.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Reactant C (Michael Donor):** To be determined.\n    *   **Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Analysis (Retrosynthesis):**\n    1.  We need to identify the bond formed during the Michael addition. The acceptor, MVK, adds as a `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` group (a `3-oxobutyl` group).\n    2.  In the product, this `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to the C2 position of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n    3.  This means the nucleophile that attacked MVK was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    4.  The C2 position of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is flanked by two carbonyl groups, making the protons on this carbon particularly acidic (pKa ≈ 11). The base (KOH) easily deprotonates this position to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Reactant C Structure:**\n    Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThese three components match the descriptions in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH).\n*   **Type of Reaction:** Michael Addition.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂, has acidic α-protons (the CH₂ group is flanked by two electron-withdrawing ester groups). The strong base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `[CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻`. This is the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electron-deficient (electrophilic) due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Reaction Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The electron pair from the C=C double bond shifts to the α-carbon, and the C=O π-bond shifts to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate. This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH).\n\n    *   **Step 1 (Attack):** `[CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻` + `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃` → `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - [CH-COOCH₃]⁻`\n    *   **Step 2 (Protonation):** `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - [CH-COOCH₃]⁻` + EtOH → `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃` + EtO⁻\n\n4.  **Identify Product (A):** The final product is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    Let's name this structure according to the options provided. The name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" describes a propane backbone (C1-C2-C3) with two methoxycarbonyl groups at C1, one at C3, and a p-tolyl group at C2.\n    *   Let's draw this: `(COOCH₃)₂CH(1) - CH(2)(p-Tolyl) - CH₂(3)COOCH₃`.\n    *   This structure exactly matches the product we derived.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH) as solvent, followed by aqueous acid workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Type of Reaction:** Stork Enamine Alkylation (a type of Michael Addition).\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center.\n\n3.  **Reaction Mechanism:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate. The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group.\n\n    *   **Step 1 (Attack):** The enamine attacks the nitrile, forming a C-C bond between C2 of the cyclohexyl ring and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. An iminium ion is formed.\n    *   **Step 2 (Hydrolysis):** The H₃O⁺ hydrolyzes the iminium ion, converting it to a ketone (C=O) at the C1 position of the cyclohexane ring and releasing protonated piperidine.\n\n4.  **Identify Product (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2). The substituent is the remnant of the butenenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`.\n    *   The structure is 2-(1-cyanopropan-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's analyze the name given in the options: **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n    *   This name describes a butanenitrile parent chain: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`.\n    *   A \"2-oxocyclohexyl\" group is attached at position 3. This means a cyclohexanone ring is attached via its C2 position.\n    *   This name perfectly describes the derived product structure. The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is typically the minor product in aqueous acid.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C\n\n*   **Reactants:** C and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water (H₂O).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Type of Reaction:** Michael Addition (working backwards).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Michael Acceptor:**\n    *   The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The Michael acceptor is MVK, `CH₂=CH-C(O)CH₃`.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon of the acceptor. The `CH₂=CH-` part of MVK becomes `-CH₂-CH₂-` after addition and protonation.\n    *   The `3-oxobutyl` group in the product is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)CH₃`. This fragment clearly comes from MVK.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Reactant C):**\n    *   The `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to C2 of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system.\n    *   This implies that the nucleophile was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The starting material C must therefore be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic C2-proton (located between the two carbonyls) of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to form the nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks MVK. The other option, `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione`, is not the standard starting material.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of compounds corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (α,β-unsaturated compound):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, (p-CH₃C₆H₄)-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The p-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The β-carbon is the one bonded to the p-tolyl group. This is a conjugate addition (1,4-addition).\n    *   The attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. An intermediate enolate is formed.\n    *   Protonation of the intermediate enolate (at the α-carbon of the original acrylate) by the solvent (EtOH) yields the final product.\n\n3.  **Draw and Name the Product (A):**\n    *   The nucleophile `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` adds to the β-carbon of `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   The resulting structure is `(p-tolyl)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this molecule systematically (IUPAC), we can consider it a substituted propane chain with three trimethyl carboxylate groups. The main chain is propane.\n        *   `C1 - C2 - C3`\n        *   Let's place the substituents to get the lowest possible numbers. If we number from the `CH(COOCH₃)₂` end, we have: `(MeOOC)₂CH¹-CH²(p-tolyl)-CH₂³-COOMe`.\n        *   This gives us a propane backbone.\n        *   Two methoxycarbonyl groups at C1.\n        *   One p-tolyl group at C2.\n        *   One methoxycarbonyl group that is part of a -CH₂COOMe group attached to C2. This numbering is incorrect.\n    *   Let's try naming it based on the name provided in the options: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n        *   Propane backbone: C1-C2-C3.\n        *   -tricarboxylate at 1,1,3 means: C1 has two `-COOCH₃` groups, and C3 has one `-COOCH₃` group.\n        *   2-(p-tolyl) means a p-tolyl group is on C2.\n        *   The structure is: `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n    *   This structure matches the one derived from the reaction mechanism. Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a neutral, carbon-based nucleophile, analogous to an enolate. It is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nucleophilic carbon is the α-carbon of the enamine (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH=CH-CN.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   The final step involves hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). The acid hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Draw and Name the Product (B):**\n    *   The nucleophilic C2 of the enamine attacks the β-carbon (C3) of CH₃-CH=CH-CN.\n    *   A new bond forms between C2 of the cyclohexane ring and C3 of the butanenitrile chain. The substituent added to the ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`.\n    *   After hydrolysis, the enamine part (`C=N⁺<`) reverts to a ketone (`C=O`) at C1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN` group at position 2.\n    *   To name this molecule, we can consider it a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is butanenitrile (`N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H-C⁴H₃`).\n    *   The substituent on C3 is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    *   Thus, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.

A new C-C bond is formed. Let's identify the bond and the fragments.\n    *   The product has a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` core and a `-(CH₂)₂-CO-CH₃` (3-oxobutyl) side chain at position 2.\n    *   The side chain `-(CH₂)₂-CO-CH₃` comes from the Michael acceptor, `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`, after the addition and protonation. The bond was formed to the β-carbon (the CH₂ group) of MVK.\n    *   This means the nucleophile must have been the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` molecule itself, which donated its C2 atom.\n    *   The protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are highly acidic because they are located between two carbonyl groups (a β-dicarbonyl system).\n    *   The base, KOH, deprotonates cyclohexane-1,3-dione at C2 to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Therefore, reactant **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, `CH2(COOCH3)2`. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-hydrogen between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `[CH(COOCH3)2]^-`. This is the nucleophile.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH3`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon atom attached to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the methyl acrylate derivative.\n    *   The electrons from the C=C double bond shift to form another enolate intermediate, which is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to give the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Draw the Product Structure:**\n    *   The `CH(COOCH3)2` group (from the donor) forms a new bond with the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The original α-carbon of the acceptor gains a proton.\n    *   Donor fragment: `-CH(COOCH3)2`\n    *   Acceptor fragment: `p-Tolyl-CH(β)-CH(α)H-COOCH3`\n    *   Product (A): `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH2-COOCH3`\n\n4.  **Name the Product (A):**\n    *   We need to find the correct IUPAC name for the structure `(MeOOC)2CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH2-COOMe`.\n    *   Let's analyze the names given in the options.\n        *   `trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate`: This name implies the structure `p-Tolyl-CH2-CH(COOMe)-CH(COOMe)2`. This would result from an attack on the α-carbon, which is incorrect for a Michael addition.\n        *   `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`: This name implies a propane chain (C1-C2-C3). Carboxylate groups are at positions 1, 1, and 3. A p-tolyl group is at position 2. Let's build this structure: `(MeOOC)2CH(C1)-CH(p-Tolyl)(C2)-CH2(C3)-COOMe`. This structure matches the product derived from the Michael addition.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which is a variation of the Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor (as enamine):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the α-carbon.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile, `CH3-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion and a carbanion, which is protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n    *   Finally, the acidic workup (`H3O+`) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a ketone.\n\n3.  **Draw the Product Structure:**\n    *   The net result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The group added is derived from the acceptor, `CH3-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The new bond is between C2 of the ketone and Cβ of the nitrile. Cα of the nitrile gets a proton.\n    *   The added fragment is `-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with the `-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN` group attached at the C2 position.\n\n4.  **Name the Product (B):**\n    *   The structure is 2-(1-methyl-2-cyanoethyl)cyclohexanone.\n    *   Let's check the names in the options.\n        *   `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`: This is the enol tautomer of the product.\n        *   `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`: This names the compound by treating the butanenitrile as the parent chain. The substituent at position 3 is the (2-oxocyclohexyl) group. This accurately describes the keto form of the product.\n    *   The keto form is generally the more stable and major product after an acidic workup that hydrolyzes the intermediate.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where we need to find the Michael donor (reactant C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, `CH2=CH-CO-CH3`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Structures (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   The Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   Let's identify the fragment that came from the acceptor. The acceptor is `CH2(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH3`. After reaction, it becomes the `-CH2(β)-CH2(α)-CO-CH3` group, which is a `(3-oxobutyl)` group.\n    *   The product shows this `(3-oxobutyl)` group attached to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring system.\n    *   This means the bond was formed between C2 of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   Therefore, the donor must have been the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The starting material (C) that forms this enolate upon treatment with base (KOH) is the dione itself.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C:**\n    *   The methylene protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic because they are flanked by two carbonyl groups. They are readily removed by KOH to form the nucleophilic enolate required for the Michael addition.\n    *   The alternative option, `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione`, is the enol tautomer. While the enolate is the reactive species, the starting material is typically written as the diketone.\n    *   Therefore, **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nThese results correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   The Michael donor is the nucleophile. Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the mixture. The α-protons of dimethyl malonate (CH₂(COOCH₃)₂) are highly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. Thus, dimethyl malonate will be deprotonated to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`, which serves as the Michael donor.\n    *   The Michael acceptor is the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-COOCH₃`).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Enolate formation):** `NaOEt + CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ → ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ Na⁺ + EtOH`\n    *   **Step 2 (Nucleophilic attack):** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The double bond electrons shift to the α-carbon, and the carbonyl electrons shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n        `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + (p-tolyl)-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃ → (p-tolyl)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH⁻-COOCH₃`\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent, ethanol (EtOH), to yield the final neutral product (A).\n        `(p-tolyl)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH⁻-COOCH₃ + EtOH → (p-tolyl)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n\n3.  **Identify Product (A):**\n    *   The structure of product (A) is `(p-tolyl)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this compound using IUPAC rules, we identify the parent acid. The structure can be seen as a derivative of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid (`HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH(COOH)₂`) that is substituted with a p-tolyl group at the C2 position.\n    *   The structure is `CH₃OOC-CH₂-CH(p-tolyl)-CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   This reaction is a Stork enamine synthesis, a variation of the Michael reaction.\n    *   The Michael donor is the enamine, **1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine**, which is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral but highly nucleophilic at their α-carbon.\n    *   The Michael acceptor is the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, **(E)-but-2-enenitrile** (crotononitrile, `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Nucleophilic attack):** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms an iminium ion and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   **Step 2 (Protonation):** The carbanion is protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n    *   **Step 3 (Hydrolysis):** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone), regenerating the cyclohexanone ring and producing a protonated piperidine salt.\n\n3.  **Identify Product (B):**\n    *   The net result is the formation of a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone) and the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   The fragment from butenenitrile that gets attached to the ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   This group is attached to the α-carbon (C2) of cyclohexanone.\n    *   The final product (B) is 2-substituted cyclohexanone: `2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexan-1-one`.\n    *   To name this compound, we treat the nitrile as the principal functional group. The parent chain is butanenitrile. The (2-oxocyclohexyl) group is a substituent at the C3 position of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major stable product, not the enol tautomer.\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify the Knowns (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a retrosynthesis problem where we need to find the starting material C.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** C.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Product and Reverse the Reaction:**\n    *   The Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   Let's identify this bond in the product. The substituent `-(3-oxobutyl)` has the structure `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`. This group comes from MVK (`CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`). The bond is formed to the β-carbon.\n    *   The donor's nucleophilic carbon is the C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring.

The resulting proton is highly acidic because the negative charge on the conjugate base (the enolate) is stabilized by resonance across two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n        `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt → Na⁺ ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + EtOH`\n        The nucleophile is the malonate enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon atom of the C=C double bond that is further from the ester group) is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group. The structure is `p-tolyl-C³H=C²H-C¹(=O)OCH₃`. The β-carbon is C3.\n    3.  **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon (C3) of the acrylate. The π-electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon (C2), and the carbonyl π-electrons shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate. This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol) at the α-carbon to yield the final product.\n        *   **Attack:** `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`.\n        *   **Bond Formation:** A new C-C bond forms between the carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n        *   **Product Structure:** `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    4.  **Naming Product (A):** The product is a tri-ester.

Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C=C carbon not bonded to the nitrogen).

This forms a new C-C bond and generates an iminium ion intermediate. The acidic workup (`H₃O⁺`) serves two purposes: it protonates the nitrile intermediate and, crucially, it hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n        *   **Attack:** The enamine attacks `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`.\n        *   **Resulting Alkyl Group:** The fragment added to the cyclohexanone ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n        *   **Hydrolysis:** The enamine functionality is converted back to a ketone (cyclohexanone).

The keto form is the major, most stable product, not the enol (`-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl`).\n\n### **Reaction C**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Reactant `C` + but-3-en-2-one (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`)\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (`KOH`) in water (`H₂O`).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a retrospective analysis (retrosynthesis) to find the starting Michael donor (`C`).\n    1.  **Identify Fragments:** The product, 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, is formed by joining two molecules. We can identify these by cleaving the bond formed during the Michael addition.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor:** The problem states that but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK) is one of the reactants. In the product, this corresponds to the \"3-oxobutyl\" side chain (`-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`). This group is formed by adding a nucleophile to the β-carbon and a proton to the α-carbon of MVK (`CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`).\n    3.  **Michael Donor (Reactant C):** The rest of the molecule is the Michael donor. This is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system. The bond was formed at the C2 position of this ring. The C2 protons of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic because they are located between two carbonyl groups (an active methylene group). The base (`KOH`) removes one of these protons to form a highly stabilized enolate, which then acts as the nucleophile in the Michael addition.\n    4.  **Conclusion for C:** Therefore, reactant `C` is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the three reactions to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n**Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n**Reagents:** NaOEt, EtOH (Sodium ethoxide in ethanol)\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleophile (Michael Donor):** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that will deprotonate the most acidic proton. Dimethyl malonate has acidic α-protons on the carbon between the two ester groups (pKa ≈ 13). The base deprotonates this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, which acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   **Nucleophile Formation:** CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt → ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ Na⁺ + EtOH\n\n2.  **Identify the Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon double-bonded to the α-carbon and also attached to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic due to resonance with the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Structure:** p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a conjugate addition reaction.\n    *   **Attack:** ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃ → (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-⁻CH-COOCH₃\n    *   This forms a new enolate intermediate.\n\n4.  **Protonation:** The intermediate enolate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n    *   **Product Formation:** (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-⁻CH-COOCH₃ + EtOH → (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻\n\n5.  **Identify Product A:** The structure of the product is (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃. Let's match this to the names provided.\n    *   **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate:** This name describes a three-carbon chain (propane) derived from the malonate carbon (C1) and the two carbons of the acrylate double bond (C2 and C3). The p-tolyl group is on C2, and the three trimethyl carboxylate groups are at positions C1, C1, and C3. This matches the product structure.\n    *   **trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate:** This name would imply a different connectivity that does not result from this reaction.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction B:\n**Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n**Reagents:** MeOH, H₃O⁺\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleophile (Michael Donor):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the carbon that was α to the original ketone's carbonyl). This reaction is a Stork enamine synthesis, which is a variation of the Michael addition.\n\n2.  **Identify the Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (attached to the methyl group) is electrophilic.\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n\n4.  **Hydrolysis:** The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) in the workup step hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group. The overall result is the alkylation of the cyclohexanone at its α-position.\n\n5.  **Identify Product B:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-carbon (C2) with the group derived from the butenenitrile acceptor. The added group is -CH(CH₃)CH₂CN.\n    *   **Product Structure:** 2-[CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Naming:** The principal functional group is the nitrile (CN). The parent chain is a butanenitrile. Numbering from the nitrile carbon, the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3. The substituent is a (2-oxocyclohexyl) group.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name, 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, describes the enol tautomer, which is the minor product; the ketone is the major, more stable product.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction C:\n**Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n**Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n**Reagents:** KOH, H₂O\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retro-Michael):** We are given the product and one reactant and need to find the other reactant (C). This is a Michael addition. The product is formed by creating a bond between the nucleophile (enolate of C) and the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor:** The reactant is but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).\n    *   **Structure:** CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   After the reaction, this fragment becomes the substituent on the nucleophile. The double bond is reduced, and a proton is added to the α-carbon, resulting in the group -CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-C(=O)CH₃. This is a **3-oxobutyl** group.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael Donor (C):** The product is named 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This tells us that the 3-oxobutyl group (from MVK) is attached to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic methylene protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   This enolate then attacks MVK to form the final product.\n    *   Thus, the starting material **C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The alternative, 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, is an incorrect structure and not the reactant.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A:\n**Reactants:**\n*   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate (CH₂(COOCH₃)₂)\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃)\n*   **Base/Solvent:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH)\n\n**Mechanism:**\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The base, NaOEt, is strong enough to deprotonate the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate. The α-protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 13) because the resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by resonance with both adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt ⇌ ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ Na⁺ + EtOH\n\n2.  **Michael Addition (1,4-Conjugate Addition):** The nucleophilic enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The β-carbon is the one bonded to the p-tolyl group.\n    p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃ + ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - C⁻H-COOCH₃\n\n3.  **Protonation:** The resulting intermediate enolate is protonated by the solvent, ethanol, to yield the final neutral product.\n    p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - C⁻H-COOCH₃ + EtOH → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻\n\n**Product (A):**\nThe structure of the product is p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃.\nTo name this compound according to the options, we can consider it a substituted propane chain where the main carbons are C(α) of the malonate, C(β) of the acrylate, and C(α) of the acrylate. This systematic naming leads to **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This matches the structure derived from the reaction.\n\n### Reaction B:\n**Reactants:**\n*   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine (an enamine, a nitrogen analog of an enolate)\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN)\n*   **Solvent/Workup:** Methanol (MeOH), followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺)\n\n**Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n1.  **Enamine Formation (Implied):** The enamine is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. It serves as the nucleophile. The nucleophilic carbon is the α-carbon of the original ketone (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium ion.\n3.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium ion back to a carbonyl group. The piperidine is removed, and the cyclohexanone ring is reformed.\n\n**Product (B):**\nThe final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-carbon (C2) with the remnant of the butenenitrile. The substituent is -CH(CH₃)CH₂CN. The keto form is the major product after acidic workup.\nThe structure is 2-substituted cyclohexanone. Naming this compound with the nitrile as the principal functional group gives **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n**Reactants and Product:**\n*   **Michael Donor:** C (unknown)\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (also known as methyl vinyl ketone or MVK, CH₂=CH-COCH₃)\n*   **Base/Solvent:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water (H₂O)\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n**Retrosynthesis (Working backwards):**\n1.  **Identify the new bond:** The Michael reaction forms a bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n2.  **Analyze the product:** The product is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring with a substituent at C2. The substituent is a \"3-oxobutyl\" group: -CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃.\n3.  **Analyze the acceptor:** The acceptor is MVK, CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃. After the Michael addition and protonation, it becomes the -CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃ group. The new bond is formed at its β-carbon (the CH₂ group).\n4.  **Identify the donor:** The new bond is between the C2 of the dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK. Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of the molecule from which the dione ring originates. The protons on C2 of a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound are highly acidic and are readily removed by a base like KOH to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n5.  **Conclusion for C:** The starting material C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n**Summary of Conclusions:**\n*   A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these conclusions with the given options:\n*   A) A = correct, B = correct, C = incorrect (2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione is the wrong reactant).\n*   B) A = correct, B = correct, C = correct.\n*   C) A = incorrect, B = incorrect, C = incorrect.\n*   D) A = incorrect, B = incorrect, C = correct.\n\nTherefore, option B correctly identifies all reactants and products.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂, has acidic protons on the central carbon (α-carbon) because the resulting negative charge is stabilized by resonance with two adjacent carbonyl groups. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates dimethyl malonate to form a nucleophilic enolate ion:\n    `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The p-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position.\n    Structure: `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`\n    The β-carbon is the electrophilic site that will be attacked by the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:** The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The π electrons of the double bond move to the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(β)(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻C(α)H-COOCH₃`\n\n4.  **Protonation:** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent, ethanol (EtOH), to yield the final product (A).\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂(α) - COOCH₃`\n\n5.  **Naming the Product (A):** Let's analyze the structure `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂ - COOCH₃`. This can be named as a substituted propane tricarboxylate. The main chain consists of the three carbons that form the backbone of the new molecule: the α-carbon from the malonate and the α and β carbons from the acrylate.\n    *   Let C1 be the carbon from dimethyl malonate, which is bonded to two `-COOCH₃` groups.\n    *   Let C2 be the β-carbon from the acrylate, which is bonded to the `p-tolyl` group.\n    *   Let C3 be the α-carbon from the acrylate, which is bonded to the final `-COOCH₃` group (via its carbonyl carbon).\n    The structure is `(MeOOC)₂CH(1)-CH(p-tolyl)(2)-CH₂(3)-COOMe`. This name corresponds to **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are excellent nucleophiles at the β-carbon (the C2 of the original cyclohexanone ring). This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which proceeds via a Michael addition mechanism.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    Structure: `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`\n    The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:** The nucleophilic carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond and an iminium ion intermediate.\n\n4.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group. This regenerates the cyclohexanone ring. The nitrile group remains intact under these mild conditions. The final product (B) is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position. The substituent is derived from the but-2-enenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n5.  **Naming the Product (B):** The product is 2-(-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN)cyclohexanone. According to IUPAC rules, if a chain attached to a ring has a principal functional group (here, the nitrile -CN), the chain becomes the parent name.\n    *   The parent chain is butanenitrile: `NC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H-C(4)H₃`.\n    *   At position 3, there is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` substituent.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name in the options, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer. The keto form is the major, more stable product under these conditions.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retro-Michael Analysis):** We are given the product and one reactant and need to find the other reactant (C).

Structure: `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`. Upon Michael addition, this becomes the `-(CH₂)CH₂C(=O)CH₃` group seen in the product.\n4.  **Michael Donor (Reactant C):** The new bond in the product is between the C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring and the β-carbon of the MVK. This means the nucleophile was the enolate of the species at the C2 position. The protons at C2 of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` are highly acidic because they are flanked by two carbonyl groups. The base (KOH) deprotonates this position to form the nucleophilic enolate. Therefore, reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) Incorrect (Name for A and B are wrong)\n*   B) **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione** (Correct for all three)\n*   C) Incorrect (Name for C is wrong)\n*   D) Incorrect (Name for A, B, and C are wrong)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂.

The C2 position is highly acidic as it is between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the bond formed was between C2 of the donor and the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   This means the Michael donor was the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione, formed by deprotonation with KOH.\n\n3.  **Structure of Reactant (C):**\n    The starting material (C) that forms this enolate is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   **A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these findings with the given options:\n\n*   A) A=correct, B=correct, C=incorrect\n*   B) A=incorrect, B=incorrect, C=incorrect\n*   C) A=incorrect, B=incorrect, C=correct\n*   D) A=correct, B=correct, C=correct\n\nOption D correctly identifies all reactants and products.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n*   **Reagents:** NaOEt, EtOH (Sodium ethoxide in ethanol)\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Sodium ethoxide is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, which is acidic due to its position between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. This creates a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOMe)₂`.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon double-bonded to the one adjacent to the carbonyl group, and also attached to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic. The structure is `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`.\n    3.  **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a 1,4-conjugate addition. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed. The resulting intermediate enolate is then protonated by the ethanol solvent.\n    4.  **Product Structure:** The new bond connects the central carbon of the malonate to the β-carbon of the acrylate. The final, neutral product is:\n        `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) - CH₂ - COOMe`\n        which can also be written as:\n        `(MeOOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂ - COOMe`\n    5.  **Product Name (A):** To name this structure, we can consider the three-carbon chain connecting the ester groups as a propane backbone.\n        *   `C1`: The carbon from the malonate, having two methoxycarbonyl groups (`-COOMe`).\n        *   `C2`: The β-carbon from the acrylate, now bearing the `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   `C3`: The α-carbon from the acrylate, now a `CH₂` adjacent to a methoxycarbonyl group.\n        This naming leads to **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n*   **Reagents:** MeOH, H₃O⁺\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are analogues of enolates and are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This reaction is a specific type of Michael addition known as the Stork enamine synthesis.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`, also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center.\n    3.  **Reaction:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium ion. The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) serves to hydrolyze this iminium ion back into a ketone.\n    4.  **Product Structure:** The starting ketone was cyclohexanone. A new substituent is added at its α-position (C2). The substituent comes from the but-2-enenitrile fragment `CH₃-CH-CH₂-CN`. The bond forms between C2 of the ring and the original β-carbon of the nitrile. The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at the C2 position.\n    5.  **Product Name (B):** This product can be named as a substituted butanenitrile. The butanenitrile chain is `C⁴H₃-C³H-C²H₂-C¹N`. The substituent at C3 is the `2-oxocyclohexyl` group. Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is generally not the major product under these (acidic workup) conditions.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Reagents:** KOH, H₂O\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **Analysis:** This is a problem where we must deduce the starting material (C).\n    1.  **Analyze the knowns:** The product is formed from a Michael addition between reactant C and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK). The reagent is a base (KOH).\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`) is the Michael acceptor.\n    3.  **Michael Donor:** Reactant C must be the Michael donor. The base (KOH) will deprotonate it to form the nucleophile.\n    4.  **Retrosynthesis:** We can identify C by mentally reversing the Michael addition. The bond formed connects the nucleophile (from C) to the β-carbon of the acceptor (MVK).\n        *   Product: `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` part is the core structure. The `-(3-oxobutyl)` group is `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n        *   This substituent is attached to C2 of the dione ring, the highly acidic carbon between the two carbonyls.\n        *   The added fragment `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` came from the Michael acceptor `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃` after the reaction.\n        *   Therefore, the Michael donor C must have been **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a base (sodium ethoxide, NaOEt), the acidic proton on the α-carbon (the CH₂ group between the two carbonyls) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the ester group.\n\n2.  **Mechanism of the Michael Addition:**\n    *   The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.\n    *   The π electrons of the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, and the electrons of the C=O double bond shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH=C(O⁻)OCH₃`.\n    *   This enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH), typically at the α-carbon, to yield the final, neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product (A):**\n    *   The final product structure is:\n        `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`\n    *   To name this molecule, we need to identify the longest carbon chain that can serve as the parent. The options suggest a \"propane-tricarboxylate\" naming scheme. Let's orient the molecule to fit this system. The structure can be written as:\n        `(MeOOC)CH₂ - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH(COOMe)₂`\n    *   Let's number this as a substituted propane chain: `C(3)H₂(COOMe) - C(2)H(p-Tolyl) - C(1)H(COOMe)₂`.\n    *   This is a propane chain with:\n        *   Two methoxycarbonyl groups at C-1.\n        *   One p-tolyl group at C-2.\n        *   One methoxycarbonyl group at C-3.\n    *   The systematic name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This matches the name for compound A in options B and D.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type and Reactants:**\n    *   This is a **Stork enamine synthesis**, which utilizes an enamine as the nucleophile in a Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system (the C-2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   The β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms a C-C bond, generating an iminium ion from the enamine part and a resonance-stabilized anion from the nitrile part.\n    *   The anion is protonated.\n    *   Finally, the addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion intermediate back to a ketone.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product (B):**\n    *   The reaction attaches the `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` fragment (from but-2-enenitrile) to the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone).\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone:\n        `2-[CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]-cyclohexanone`\n    *   To name this product, we can consider the butanenitrile chain as the parent. The chain originating from the acceptor is `N≡C-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-`.\n    *   This is a butanenitrile backbone, numbered `N≡C(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(subst)-C(4)H₃`.\n    *   The substituent on C-3 is the cyclohexanone ring, attached at its C-2 position. The name for this substituent group is `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the product name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile` is the enol form, which is not the major product after acidic hydrolysis. This matches the name for compound B in options B and D.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we need to find the starting Michael donor (reactant C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   The reaction forms a new bond between the donor's nucleophilic carbon and the acceptor's β-carbon.\n\n2.  **Deduce Reactant C:**\n    *   Let's analyze the product structure. It consists of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring and a `(3-oxobutyl)` side chain `(-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃)`.\n    *   The side chain `(-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃)` is formed from the Michael acceptor, MVK (`CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`), after it gets attacked at the β-carbon (`CH₂=`) and the α-carbon (`=CH-`) gets protonated. This matches perfectly.\n    *   This means the `(3-oxobutyl)` group was added to the Michael donor.\n    *   The remainder of the molecule is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety, and the new bond is at the C-2 position. The C-2 carbon (CH₂) is located between two carbonyl groups, making its protons highly acidic.\n    *   Therefore, the Michael donor (reactant C) must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the C-2 position to form the nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks MVK. This matches the name for compound C in options A and B.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBy analyzing all three reactions, we have determined:\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nThis combination of names corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH).\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Sodium ethoxide is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in the mixture. The α-protons of dimethyl malonate (the protons on the carbon between the two ester carbonyls) are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 13). NaOEt removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, which acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt <=> [⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂]Na⁺ + EtOH`\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. Due to conjugation with the carbonyl group, the β-carbon is electron-deficient and thus electrophilic.\n    *   Structure: `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`\n\n3.  **The Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a 1,4-conjugate addition. The resulting intermediate enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final product.\n    *   **Step 1 (Attack):** `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   **Step 2 (Protonation):** The intermediate is protonated to give the neutral product.\n    *   **Product Structure:** A new C-C bond is formed between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. The final structure is:\n        `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂ - COOCH₃`\n\n4.  **Name the Product (A):** The product has three methyl ester groups. We can name it as a substituted tricarboxylate on a propane backbone.\n    *   Let's analyze the name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    *   Parent: propane (`C3-C2-C1`)\n    *   Substituents:\n        *   At C1: Two `-COOCH₃` groups (`-CH(COOCH₃)₂`)\n        *   At C2: One `-p-tolyl` group\n        *   At C3: One `-COOCH₃` group (`-CH₂COOCH₃`)\n    *   Assembling this gives: `(CH₃OOC)CH₂(3) - CH(2)(p-Tolyl) - CH(1)(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   Rearranging our derived product gives `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂COOCH₃`, which matches the structure derived from the name.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH), then H₃O⁺.\n*   **Type:** Stork Enamine Alkylation (a Michael addition variant).\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are electron-rich and act as nucleophiles at the β-carbon (the C=C double bond carbon not attached to the nitrogen).\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n    *   Structure: `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`\n\n3.  **The Reaction:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an intermediate containing an iminium ion and a nitrile enolate. The subsequent acidic workup (H₃O⁺) has two functions:\n    *   It protonates the nitrile enolate.\n    *   It hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone (cyclohexanone).\n\n4.  **Determine the Product (B):** The net result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at its α-position.\n    *   The original ketone is cyclohexanone.\n    *   The group added to the α-carbon (C2) comes from but-2-enenitrile. The point of attachment is the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The fragment from the nitrile is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanone ring with this group at C2.\n    *   Let's name the product as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is butanenitrile (`-CH₂-CH₂-CN` isn't right). The main chain is `butanenitrile`, so `C4H₃-C3H-C2H₂-C1N`. The substituent is attached at C3.\n    *   The substituent is the cyclohexanone ring attached at C2, which is a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   The name is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. The keto tautomer is the major, most stable product. The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, is the enol form, which is not the major final product under these conditions.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water (H₂O).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition (Retrosynthesis problem).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Reactant:** We need to find reactant C.\n    *   Product: `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This means we have a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring with a `(3-oxobutyl)` group attached to C2. The C2 position is the CH₂ group between the two carbonyls.\n    *   Structure of the (3-oxobutyl) group: `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   Reactant/Michael Acceptor: `but-3-en-2-one`, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). Its structure is `CH₂=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthesis:** The Michael addition involves the attack of a nucleophile on the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n    *   The MVK fragment in the product is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`. This is formed when a nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (`CH₂=`) of MVK.\n    *   The new bond is between this β-carbon and the nucleophile. In the product, this bond is to C2 of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system.\n    *   This implies that the nucleophile must be the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The protons on C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic because they are flanked by two carbonyl groups and are readily removed by a base like KOH.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C:** The nucleophile (enolate) is formed from reactant C. Therefore, reactant C must be the precursor to this enolate.\n    *   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds exactly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the three reactions to determine the reactants and major final products.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(CO₂Me)₂. The α-protons between the two ester groups are acidic. The strong base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-CO₂Me`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   This attack forms a new C-C bond and creates a new enolate intermediate: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂) -CH⁻-CO₂Me`.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product (A):**\n    *   The final product structure is `(MeO₂C)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-CO₂Me`.\n    *   To name this compound using IUPAC nomenclature, we identify the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups (the esters). This is a three-carbon propane chain with carboxylate groups at positions 1, 1, and 3. The p-tolyl group is at position 2.\n    *   The systematic name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (which corresponds to the α-carbon of the parent ketone). The nucleophilic attack occurs from the C2 position of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   The enamine's nucleophilic carbon (C2 of the ring) attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms an iminium ion on the ring and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   The carbanion is protonated (likely by MeOH).\n    *   The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (a ketone).\n\n3.  **Determine the Product (B):**\n    *   The overall reaction adds the butanenitrile group to the α-carbon of cyclohexanone.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group.\n    *   To name this compound, we can treat it as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is the 4-carbon nitrile. The substituent at position 3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   The systematic name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major product after acidic hydrolysis, not the enol form.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Known Reactant:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This product consists of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system and a `-(CH₂)₂-C(=O)-CH₃` (3-oxobutyl) substituent attached at the C2 position.\n    *   **Known Reactant:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`. This is a classic Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Unknown Reactant (C):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where MVK is the acceptor. Therefore, reactant C must be the Michael donor.\n    *   The 3-oxobutyl group in the product is formed from MVK after the addition reaction. The nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (the `CH₂` group) of MVK.\n    *   This implies that the nucleophile is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` anion, which then attaches to the MVK fragment.\n    *   The starting material, C, must therefore be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.

This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the ester carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enolate from dimethyl malonate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final, neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this compound, we can identify the main carbon chain. A common, albeit simplified, way to name such products is to consider the three-carbon chain formed by the malonate α-carbon, the acrylate β-carbon, and the acrylate α-carbon as the backbone.\n        *   C1: The carbon from dimethyl malonate, which has two methyl carboxylate groups attached (`-CH(COOCH₃)₂`).\n        *   C2: The β-carbon from the acrylate, which has the p-tolyl group attached (`-CH(p-tolyl)-`).\n        *   C3: The α-carbon from the acrylate, which is now a `-CH₂-` attached to the third methyl carboxylate group (`-CH₂-COOCH₃`).\n    *   This structure corresponds to a trimethyl ester of 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid.\n    *   Thus, **Product A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.**\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This reaction is a Stork enamine synthesis, a variation of the Michael reaction.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a resonance-stabilized carbanion on the nitrile portion.\n    *   The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) has two roles: first, to protonate the carbanion intermediate, and second, to hydrolyze the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The hydrolysis step converts the enamine functionality back to the original ketone, cyclohexanone.\n    *   A new substituent, derived from the but-2-enenitrile, is attached to the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone (the carbon that was the β-carbon of the enamine).\n    *   The fragment from but-2-enenitrile is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group at the 2-position.\n    *   To name this compound, we can consider butanenitrile as the parent chain. The cyano group (`-CN`) is carbon 1.\n        *   `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`\n    *   A 2-oxocyclohexyl group is attached at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Thus, **Product B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.**\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor by Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** But-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   In the Michael reaction, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (`CH₂`) and a proton adds to the α-carbon (`CH`). This means the fragment `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃` (a 3-oxobutyl group) from MVK is added to the nucleophile.\n    *   The product structure shows this exact `3-oxobutyl` group attached to the C2 position of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of Reactant C:**\n    *   The fragment that is not derived from MVK is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety, with the connection at C2.\n    *   This implies that the Michael donor was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione (the methylene group between two carbonyls) are highly acidic and are readily removed by a base like KOH to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Therefore, **Reactant C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches the descriptions in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂.

Its structure is p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The enolate of dimethyl malonate, [CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻, attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the methyl acrylate derivative.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   This creates another enolate intermediate, which is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product (A):**\n    *   The nucleophile `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` adds to the β-carbon of `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   The resulting structure is:\n        ```\n           COOCH₃\n            |\n        (p-Tolyl)-CH - CH₂ - COOCH₃\n                  |\n             CH(COOCH₃)₂\n        ```\n    *   This structure can be seen as a propane chain with substituents. To name it according to the options, we identify the main chain and substituents. The name \"propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" implies a propane backbone where carbons 1 and 3 have carboxylate groups.\n    *   Let's analyze the name **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**:\n        *   Parent: Propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate suggests a chain: (MeOOC)CH₂ – CH – CH(COOMe)₂\n        *   Substituent: A p-tolyl group at position 2.\n        *   Structure from name: (MeOOC)CH₂ – CH(p-Tolyl) – CH(COOMe)₂\n    *   This structure matches the one derived from our reaction mechanism.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine.

The nucleophilic carbon is the α-carbon of the parent ketone (cyclohexanone).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Reagents:** The initial reaction occurs in methanol (MeOH). The subsequent workup with H₃O⁺ is crucial for hydrolyzing the intermediate iminium salt back into a ketone.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion and a resonance-stabilized nitrile anion.\n    *   The anion is protonated.\n    *   The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt, regenerating the carbonyl group (ketone) at C1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product (B):**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the cyclohexanone ring system attacks the β-carbon (`-CH(CH₃)-`) of the acceptor.\n    *   The acceptor's α-carbon becomes `-CH₂-CN` after protonation.\n    *   The new substituent on the cyclohexane ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`. This substituent is at the α-position (C2) relative to the carbonyl group.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at C2.\n    *   To name this product, we consider the butanenitrile as the parent chain: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`.\n    *   The substituent is at position 3, and it is a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   Thus, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify the knowns and unknowns (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Reactant C (unknown).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Product and Acceptor:**\n    *   The product is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione with a substituent at C2.\n    *   The substituent is a `-(3-oxobutyl)` group: `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the acceptor (MVK) adds a fragment to the donor. Let's see what fragment MVK provides. Upon reaction, the `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃` molecule becomes a `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-CO-CH₃` saturated chain attached to the donor.\n    *   Comparing this to the substituent in the product (`-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`), we see they are the same (note: the IUPAC numbering '3-oxo' is based on the full substituent name, not the α,β positions of the acceptor).\n\n3.  **Determine Reactant C:**\n    *   The Michael reaction forms a bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The bond is formed between the C2 of the dione ring (the α-carbon between two carbonyls) and the `CH₂` group of the incoming `3-oxobutyl` chain.\n    *   To find the donor C, we can conceptually break this newly formed C-C bond and remove the fragment that came from the acceptor.\n    *   Removing the `-(3-oxobutyl)` group from C2 of `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione` leaves behind the donor molecule.\n    *   The donor molecule is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.

If we remove the (3-oxobutyl) group from C2 of the product, we are left with the original Michael donor.\n    *   Removing -CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃ from 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione leaves **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The reaction is: the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione (formed with KOH) attacks but-3-en-2-one. This is the first step of the Robinson annulation sequence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) Incorrect name for A and B.\n*   B) Incorrect name for A, B, and C.\n*   C) Matches all three identified structures/names.\n*   D) Incorrect name for C.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate (`CH2(COOCH3)2`). The α-carbon is flanked by two ester groups, making its protons acidic. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), will deprotonate this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (an enolate), which is a potent nucleophile.\n        `CH2(COOCH3)2 + NaOEt <=> Na+[-CH(COOCH3)2] + EtOH`\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH3`). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon bonded to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (1,4-Conjugate Addition):**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion from dimethyl malonate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, and the π-electrons from the C=O bond shift to the oxygen, forming an enolate intermediate.\n    *   This enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Predict the Product Structure:**\n    *   A new single bond is formed between the α-carbon of the dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the methyl acrylate.\n    *   The C=C double bond of the acrylate is saturated in the process.\n    *   The structure is: `(CH3OOC)2CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOCH3`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product (A):**\n    *   To name this molecule according to the options, we identify the longest carbon chain that can be considered a backbone. Let's consider a three-carbon (propane) backbone.\n    *   If we number the carbons as `C1-C2-C3` where `C1` is the `CH` from the malonate, `C2` is the `CH` from the acrylate, and `C3` is the `CH2` from the acrylate, the structure looks like this: `(CH3OOC)2-C1H - C2H(p-tolyl) - C3H2-COOCH3`.\n    *   This molecule is a tricarboxylate. There are two methyl carboxylate (`-COOCH3`) groups on C1 and one on C3. There is a p-tolyl group on C2.\n    *   Therefore, the systematic name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, a variation of the Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at their β-carbon.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`), also known as crotononitrile, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an intermediate containing an iminium ion (from the enamine part) and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion, which is quickly protonated.\n    *   The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (`H3O+`) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (a ketone).\n\n3.  **Predict the Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The piperidine is removed, and the C1 of the cyclohexane ring becomes a ketone (C=O).\n    *   The `(E)-but-2-enenitrile` moiety becomes a `CH(CH3)-CH2-CN` group attached to the α-carbon (C2) of the newly formed cyclohexanone.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position with a 3-cyanobutyl group.\n\n4.  **Name the Product (B):**\n    *   The product is a butanenitrile derivative. The parent chain is `butanenitrile`.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on this chain. It is attached at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The substituent name is (2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   Thus, the name of product B is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative option, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol form, which is typically the minor tautomer compared to the more stable keto form under these conditions.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where we need to find one of the starting materials. This requires a retrosynthetic analysis.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Product and Known Reactant:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This means a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring has a `-(CH2)2-CO-CH3` (3-oxobutyl) group at position C2.\n    *   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** But-3-en-2-one (`CH2=CH-CO-CH3`), also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).\n\n3.  **Perform Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   In a Michael addition, the new C-C bond forms between the β-carbon of the acceptor and the α-carbon of the donor.\n    *   The acceptor (MVK) is `CH2(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH3`. The `(3-oxobutyl)` side chain in the product corresponds to this molecule after the reaction. The bond to the donor is at the `CH2` (former β-carbon).\n    *   The donor's nucleophilic carbon is the C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring, which is acidic.\n    *   To find reactant C, we break the bond between C2 of the ring and the side chain.\n    *   Breaking this bond gives us the enolate of C and the acceptor. Adding a proton to the enolate reveals the identity of the Michael donor, C.\n    *   Therefore, reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Forward Reaction:**\n    *   Cyclohexane-1,3-dione has a highly acidic methylene group at C2 (pKa ≈ 5).\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates C2 to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    *   This enolate attacks the β-carbon of but-3-en-2-one.\n    *   Protonation of the resulting intermediate yields the given product. The mechanism is consistent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **A** is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   **B** is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   **C** is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nComparing this with the given options, we find that option B contains all the correct assignments.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate (nucleophile precursor), methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (Michael acceptor), and sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH) (base/solvent).\n*   **Step 1: Nucleophile Formation.** Sodium ethoxide is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate. The α-protons are acidic because the resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by resonance across two adjacent ester carbonyl groups.\n    *   `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt → Na⁺[⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂] + EtOH`\n    *   The nucleophile is the malonate anion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition.** The Michael acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The nucleophilic malonate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon (the carbon bonded to the p-tolyl group).\n    *   The attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond and a resonance-stabilized enolate intermediate: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH⁻-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Step 3: Protonation.** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent, ethanol, to yield the final neutral product (A).\n    *   `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH⁻-COOCH₃ + EtOH → p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n*   **Step 4: Naming the Product (A).** The structure is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`. To name this according to IUPAC rules as a tricarboxylate, we identify the main propane chain.\n    *   `C¹H(COOMe)₂ - C²H(p-tolyl) - C³H₂(COOMe)` is not the correct connectivity based on the reaction mechanism.\n    *   The correct structure derived is `p-tolyl-CH[CH(COOCH₃)₂]-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   Let's find the correct IUPAC name based on the options. The name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" corresponds to the structure `(MeOOC)₂-C¹H - C²H(p-tolyl) - C³H₂(COOMe)`. Let's map the atoms from the reaction to this structure.\n        *   The `CH(COOMe)₂` group comes from dimethyl malonate. Let's call this C1.\n        *   This C1 attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate, which is `CH(p-tolyl)`. Let's call this C2.\n        *   C2 is bonded to the α-carbon of the acrylate, which becomes `CH₂(COOMe)`. Let's call this C3.\n        *   The resulting structure is `(MeOOC)₂C¹H - C²H(p-tolyl) - C³H₂(COOMe)`. This perfectly matches the product derived from the mechanism.\n    *   Thus, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine (an enamine, the nucleophile), (E)-but-2-enenitrile (Michael acceptor), followed by workup with H₃O⁺. This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which is a type of Michael addition.\n*   **Step 1: Nucleophile and Acceptor.** The enamine is nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). The acceptor is `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`, and the β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition.** The α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a C-C bond and an intermediate containing an iminium ion on the cyclohexane ring and a carbanion α to the nitrile group.\n*   **Step 3: Protonation and Hydrolysis.** The carbanion is protonated (likely by the methanol solvent). Then, the addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group. Since the enamine was formed from cyclohexanone, it hydrolyzes back to cyclohexanone.\n*   **Step 4: Structure of the Product (B).** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2). The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile acceptor. The new bond is between C2 of the ring and C3 of the butene chain.\n    *   The side chain is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n    *   To name the compound, the nitrile is the principal functional group. The chain is a butanenitrile. The cyclohexanone is a substituent at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major product after acidic workup, not the enol form (`3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`).\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** An unknown reactant C and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Analysis (Retrosynthesis).** This is a Michael addition. The product is formed by adding a nucleophile to the Michael acceptor, MVK (`CH₂=CH-COCH₃`).\n*   **Step 1: Identify the bond formed.** The product is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` with a `-(CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃)` group at C2. This \"3-oxobutyl\" group is derived from MVK. A nucleophile must have attacked the β-carbon (`CH₂`) of MVK, which after protonation gives the `-CH₂CH₂COCH₃` group.\n*   **Step 2: Identify the nucleophile.** The nucleophile must therefore be the part of the molecule that is attached to this group, which is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring, attached via C2.\n*   **Step 3: Identify Reactant C.** The active nucleophile is the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`, formed by deprotonation of the highly acidic proton at C2 (located between two carbonyls) by the base (KOH). Therefore, the starting material **C must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing this with the given options, only option B matches all three results.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify Nucleophile and Michael Acceptor:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The protons on the central carbon (Cα) are acidic due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the two adjacent ester groups.\n    *   **Base:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that deprotonates the dimethyl malonate to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂. This is the active nucleophile.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. Its structure is p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃. The β-carbon is electrophilic and is the site of nucleophilic attack.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate, ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂, attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons of the C=C bond shift to form an enolate intermediate: p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH=C(O⁻)OCH₃.\n    *   This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final, stable product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product (A):**\n    *   The final product structure is p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's name this compound according to the options provided. The name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" corresponds to the following structure:\n        *   A propane chain: C3-C2-C1.\n        *   Two methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) groups on C1.\n        *   One p-tolyl group on C2.\n        *   One methoxycarbonyl group on C3.\n        *   Putting it together: (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂COOCH₃.\n    *   This structure matches our derived product.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify Nucleophile and Michael Acceptor:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine. Enamines act as carbon nucleophiles at the β-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n    *   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is a Stork enamine alkylation (a type of Michael addition), followed by acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) serves two purposes:\n        1.  It protonates the carbanion to give the -CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN side chain.\n        2.  It hydrolyzes the iminium ion (C=N⁺R₂) back to a ketone (C=O).\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product (B):**\n    *   The reaction attaches the butenenitrile fragment to the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone).\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position with a -CH(CH₃)CH₂CN group.\n    *   Let's name this product. The parent chain is butanenitrile (numbering starts from the CN group: C1 is CN, C4 is CH₃). The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on C3. The ketone is at position 2 of the cyclohexyl ring. Thus, the substituent is (2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full IUPAC name is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. The keto form is the stable product after hydrolysis, not the enol form (`-hydroxycyclohexenyl`).\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we are given the product and one reactant (the Michael acceptor) and must find the other reactant (the nucleophile precursor, C).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   Let's dissect the product. It consists of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring and a (3-oxobutyl) group (-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃) attached at position 2.\n\n2.  **Identify the Nucleophile:**\n    *   In a Michael addition to MVK, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (the CH₂ group), and the C=C double bond becomes a C-C single bond. This process converts MVK into the -CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃ (3-oxobutyl) fragment found in the product.\n    *   This means the other part of the product, the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring, must have come from the nucleophile.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the most acidic proton on reactant C to form the nucleophile. In cyclohexane-1,3-dione, the protons at C2 (the methylene group between the two carbonyls) are the most acidic.\n    *   Therefore, the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione attacks MVK.\n    *   Reactant **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of reactants and products matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A Analysis**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, [CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    2.  A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate enolate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to give the final neutral product.\n*   **Product Structure:**\n    *   Donor fragment: -CH(COOCH₃)₂\n    *   Acceptor fragment: p-tolyl-CH-CH₂-COOCH₃\n    *   Combined Product: p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃\n*   **Product Name Analysis:** Let's analyze the name given in the correct option, `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`. This name describes the product based on a conceptual three-carbon chain:\n    *   **Position 1:** The carbon from the malonate, CH(COOCH₃)₂. It carries two methyl carboxylate groups.\n    *   **Position 2:** The β-carbon from the acrylate, which is bonded to the p-tolyl group.\n    *   **Position 3:** The α-carbon from the acrylate, which is part of the -CH₂-COOCH₃ group.\n    *   Assembling these pieces according to the name gives the structure `(MeOOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂COOMe`, which is identical to the structure we derived from the reaction mechanism.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n### **Reaction B Analysis**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which functions as a Michael addition.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nucleophilic carbon is the C-2 of the cyclohexene ring (the α-carbon relative to the original ketone).\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    2.  An intermediate iminium ion is formed.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone) and protonates the nitrile intermediate.\n*   **Product Structure:**\n    *   The original enamine becomes cyclohexanone.\n    *   A new bond is formed between the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone (C-2) and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The nitrile fragment becomes -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone: a cyclohexanone ring with a -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN group attached at the C-2 position.\n*   **Product Name Analysis:** The name for this structure is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.\n    *   **Parent chain:** Butanenitrile (a four-carbon chain with a nitrile group at C-1).\n    *   **Structure:** N≡C(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H-C(4)H₃\n    *   **Substituent:** A `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group is attached to C-3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   This name perfectly describes the derived product structure. The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is less stable and not the major product for a simple ketone under these conditions.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### **Reaction C Analysis**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where we need to identify the Michael donor.\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃.\n*   **Retrosynthetic Analysis (working backward from the product):**\n    1.  Identify the portion of the product that came from the Michael acceptor (MVK). The `3-oxobutyl` group, -CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃, corresponds to the MVK molecule after it has accepted the nucleophile.\n    2.  The new C-C bond in the product is between the `3-oxobutyl` group and C-2 of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n    3.  This means the nucleophile was the enolate of the molecule that provided the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` framework.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile C):** The protons on the carbon at position 2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are flanked by two carbonyl groups, making them highly acidic (pKa ≈ 5). The base (KOH) easily deprotonates this carbon to form a stable enolate. This enolate then acts as the nucleophile.\n*   Therefore, the starting reactant **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination corresponds exactly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the three reactions to determine the correct reactants and major products.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a base (sodium ethoxide, NaOEt), the highly acidic α-proton between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   This attack pushes the π-electrons onto the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - C⁻H-COOCH₃`.\n    *   This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The final product has the structure: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n\n4.  **Name Product A:**\n    *   To name this molecule, we can consider it a derivative of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid.\n    *   The carbon chain is: C¹(H)(COOCH₃)₂ - C²(H)(p-tolyl) - C³(H₂)COOCH₃.\n    *   The IUPAC name is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n    *   This matches the name given for A in options A and B. Options C and D list a different constitutional isomer, trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, which is incorrect.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type, Donor, and Acceptor:**\n    *   This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which is a variation of the Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. It is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion at the cyclohexanone part and a carbanion stabilized by the nitrile group.\n    *   The reaction is followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). This workup serves two purposes:\n        1.  It protonates the carbanion to give `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n        2.  It hydrolyzes the iminium salt back into a ketone (cyclohexanone) and piperidinium salt.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The result is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is 2-[CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]-cyclohexanone.\n\n4.  **Name Product B:**\n    *   The parent structure is butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituent at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain is a (2-oxocyclohexyl) group.\n    *   The IUPAC name is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n    *   This corresponds to the name for B in options A and B. The name in options C and D, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is generally the minor product compared to the more stable keto form under these conditions.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction in Reverse (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where the product is known, and we must identify the starting nucleophile (Reactant C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The main structure is a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring, and the substituent at position 2 is a `3-oxobutyl` group (-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the acceptor. Here, the β-carbon is the CH₂ group. After the reaction and protonation, the acceptor becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` fragment, which is exactly the `3-oxobutyl` group seen in the product.\n    *   Therefore, the bond is formed between the C2 of the nucleophile and the β-carbon of MVK.\n\n2.  **Identify Reactant C:**\n    *   The nucleophile (`C`) must be the molecule that, after losing a proton, becomes the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` anion which attacks MVK.\n    *   The starting material `C` is therefore **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The protons on the methylene carbon between the two carbonyls (C2) are very acidic (pKa ≈ 5) and are readily removed by KOH to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options for C:**\n    *   Options A and D suggest C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This is consistent with our analysis.\n    *   Options B and C suggest C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione. This is incorrect; the reactant is the simple dione.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **Product B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **Reactant C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nCombining these findings, the only option that correctly identifies all three components is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate (CH₂(COOCH₃)₂). In the presence of a base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic proton on the α-carbon (the carbon between the two carbonyl groups) is removed to form a nucleophilic enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. The p-tolyl group is a methyl-substituted phenyl ring (`-C₆H₄-CH₃`). The β-carbon is the carbon atom of the double bond that is further from the ester group (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group).\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The malonate enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    2.  The electrons from the C=C double bond shift to form an intermediate enolate, which is then protonated by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent to yield the final product.\n*   **Product Structure (A):** The `CH(COOCH₃)₂` group from the malonate adds to the β-carbon of the acrylate. The double bond of the acrylate is saturated.\n    *   Acceptor: `p-Tolyl-C(β)H=C(α)H-COOCH₃`\n    *   Addition of `CH(COOCH₃)₂` to the β-carbon gives:\n        `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂ - COOCH₃`\n*   **Naming the Product:** To name this compound according to IUPAC rules, we can consider it a derivative of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid.\n    *   The parent acid structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH(COOH)₂`.\n    *   Our product's corresponding acid is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(p-tolyl)-CH(COOH)₂`.\n    *   This is named **2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid**.\n    *   The final product is the trimethyl ester of this acid: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nitrogen analogs of enolates and are excellent nucleophiles. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system, which is the C2 of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile). Its structure is `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. The β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n*   **Mechanism:** This reaction is a Stork enamine alkylation.\n    1.  The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    2.  This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    3.  The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) in the workup step hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a ketone.\n*   **Product Structure (B):** The overall process results in the alkylation of cyclohexanone at its α-position (the carbon next to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The fragment added from the acceptor is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanone ring with this group attached at the C2 position.\n    *   The IUPAC name is based on the butanenitrile chain. The substituent is a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group attached at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, the product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, stable product, not the enol form.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reaction:** `C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`\n*   **Analysis:** We need to identify the reactant C by working backward from the product.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring with a `-(CH₂)₂-CO-CH₃` group at C2 (the acidic carbon between the two carbonyls).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), with the structure `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   The added fragment in the product, `-(CH₂)₂-CO-CH₃`, is formed from MVK after the conjugate addition and subsequent protonation/tautomerization.\n    *   This implies that the Michael donor must be the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` skeleton. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic C2 position to form the nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks the MVK.\n*   **Reactant C:** The Michael donor is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLet's match our findings with the options provided:\n*   **A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of reactants and products corresponds exactly to option D.\n\n*   A) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate (Incorrect A), B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile (Incorrect B), C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Correct C)\n*   B) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate (Correct A), B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile (Correct B), C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)\n*   C) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate (Incorrect A), B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile (Incorrect B), C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)\n*   D) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate (Correct A), B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile (Correct B), C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Correct C)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the α-carbon which is acidic because it is situated between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. This forms a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-CO₂Me`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site for conjugate addition.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to yield the final adduct.\n    *   The overall reaction is:\n        `⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂ + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-CO₂Me  →  (MeO₂C)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-C⁻H-CO₂Me`\n        `(MeO₂C)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-C⁻H-CO₂Me + EtOH  →  (MeO₂C)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-CO₂Me + EtO⁻`\n\n3.  **Identify Product A:**\n    *   The product structure is `(MeO₂C)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-CO₂Me`.\n    *   Let's name this structure according to the options. Consider a propane chain as the backbone: C1-C2-C3.\n    *   Let C1 be the carbon from the malonate (`CH(CO₂Me)₂`), C2 be the original β-carbon of the acrylate (`CH(p-tolyl)`), and C3 be the original α-carbon of the acrylate (`CH₂`), which is now attached to the third ester group.\n    *   The structure can be drawn as: `(MeO₂C)₂-C¹H - C²H(p-tolyl) - C³H₂-CO₂Me`.\n    *   Let's check the name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\":\n        *   \"propane\" indicates a 3-carbon chain (C1, C2, C3).\n        *   \"1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" means three trimethyl ester groups at positions 1, 1, and 3.\n        *   \"2-(p-tolyl)\" means a p-tolyl group is on carbon 2.\n    *   This name corresponds to the structure `MeOOC-C³H₂ - C²H(p-tolyl) - C¹H(COOMe)₂`, which matches our derived product.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which is a type of Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile with the structure `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    *   The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone.\n\n3.  **Identify Product B:**\n    *   The original enamine was derived from cyclohexanone, so hydrolysis regenerates the cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   A new C-C bond is formed between C2 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The fragment from butenenitrile is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at position 2.\n    *   Let's name this structure. We can consider the butanenitrile as the parent chain: `CN(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(C3)-CH₃(C4)`.\n    *   The substituent at C3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   So, the name is **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile` represents the enol form, which is not the major, most stable product after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify Reactant C by Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we need to find the donor (reactant C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The main ring is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The substituent at C2 is a \"3-oxobutyl\" group: `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   **Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). Its structure is `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   The bond formed during a Michael addition is between the nucleophilic carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The β-carbon of MVK is the `CH₂` group. In the product, this corresponds to the first `CH₂` of the 3-oxobutyl side chain.\n    *   Therefore, the bond that was formed is between C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   This means the Michael donor (C) must have been **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic proton at C2 (between the two carbonyls) to form the nucleophilic enolate which then attacks MVK.\n    *   The other possibility listed, 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, is not a standard representation for a stable reactant.

The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), is strong enough to deprotonate the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate. The resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by resonance with the two adjacent ester carbonyl groups, making it an excellent nucleophile for the Michael addition.\n        *   CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt  ⇌  Na⁺[⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂] + EtOH\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the ester carbonyl group. The *p*-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position.\n        *   Structure: p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is another enolate, which is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final neutral product.\n\n    [⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂] + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃  →  (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃\n    (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃ + EtOH  →  (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻\n\n3.  **Identify Product (A):**\n    *   The product is **(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃**.\n    *   To name this molecule, we can consider it a substituted propane chain. Let's use the name provided in the options for verification. The name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" describes the following structure:\n        *   A three-carbon propane chain (C1-C2-C3).\n        *   Two methyl carboxylate (-COOCH₃) groups on C1.\n        *   A *p*-tolyl group on C2.\n        *   One methyl carboxylate (-COOCH₃) group on C3.\n        *   This corresponds to the structure we derived: (MeOOC)₂C¹H-C²H(p-tolyl)-C³H₂-COOMe.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are analogous to enolates and are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the α-carbon of the parent ketone).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n        *   Structure: CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. This forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the original ketone and the β-carbon of the nitrile, generating an iminium salt intermediate.\n    *   **Hydrolysis:** The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt back into a ketone. The piperidine is removed and protonated.\n\n3.  **Identify Product (B):**\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The substituent is derived from but-2-enenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   So, the product is 2-(1-methyl-2-cyanoethyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's name this compound according to IUPAC rules. The nitrile group (CN) has higher priority than the ketone group (C=O). Thus, the parent chain is the butanenitrile.\n        *   The butanenitrile chain is NC¹-C²H₂-C³H-C⁴H₃.\n        *   The substituent is on C3, and it is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n    *   This confirms that product B matches the description in options A and B. The alternative name in C and D, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, describes the enol form, which is not the major product after acidic workup.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the knowns (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (Methyl Vinyl Ketone, MVK). Structure: CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   **Conditions:** KOH, H₂O. KOH is the base to generate the nucleophile.\n    *   **Unknown:** Reactant C, the Michael Donor.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthetic Analysis:**\n    *   The Michael reaction forms a bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   Let's identify this bond in the product. The product is a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring with a `2-(3-oxobutyl)` substituent. The substituent is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`. This chain came from MVK (`CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`). The C-C bond formed is between the C2 of the dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK (the terminal CH₂).\n    *   To find reactant C, we break this bond. Breaking the bond between the ring and the side chain gives us the two starting components (in their reactive, ionic forms): the enolate of reactant C and the electrophilic form of MVK.\n    *   The nucleophile is the enolate of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` where C2 is deprotonated. The hydrogens on C2 are particularly acidic because the negative charge is stabilized by two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the starting material C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n3.  **Verify with a formula check:**\n    *   Product: 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione (C₁₀H₁₄O₃)\n    *   Reactant (MVK): but-3-en-2-one (C₄H₆O)\n    *   Reactant (C) + C₄H₆O → C₁₀H₁₄O₃\n    *   By subtraction, reactant C must have the formula C₁₀H₁₄O₃ - C₄H₆O = C₆H₈O₂.\n    *   Let's check the formula for the options for C:\n        *   `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`: C₆H₈O₂.

This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The electrophilic carbon for Michael addition is the β-carbon (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to form an enolate intermediate from the acrylate portion.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   Reactants: `(p-CH₃C₆H₄)-CβH=CαH-COOCH₃` and `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   The new bond forms between the β-carbon of the acrylate and the central carbon of the malonate.\n    *   Structure after attack and protonation: `(p-CH₃C₆H₄)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`.\n\n4.  **Match the Structure with the Given Names:**\n    *   Let's analyze the name from option B: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n    *   Let's deconstruct this name to draw the structure:\n        *   The parent chain is a propane with three trimethyl carboxylate groups (`-COOCH₃`).\n        *   The locants `1,1,3` indicate the positions of these carboxylate groups. However, a `C1-C2-C3` propane chain cannot have a substituent at position 3 and also two at position 1. This name seems to be based on a parent tricarboxylic acid, `propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid`.\n        *   Let's build the structure based on connectivity: A central carbon (`C2`) is bonded to a p-tolyl group.

The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), abstracts one of the highly acidic α-protons located between the two carbonyl groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-CH₃C₆H₄-CH=CH-COOCH₃`.

A `3-oxobutyl` group (`-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`) attached to position 2 of the dione ring.\n    *   In a Michael reaction, the nucleophile (donor) attacks the β-carbon of the acceptor. The α-carbon of a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound is highly acidic and readily forms an enolate. Therefore, C2 of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring is the nucleophilic center.\n    *   The `3-oxobutyl` side chain must have come from the Michael acceptor, `but-3-en-2-one` (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`).

In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), one of the acidic α-protons (the protons on the carbon between the two carbonyl groups) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The p-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position. The β-carbon (the carbon atom bonded to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    2.  The π electrons from the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and the π electrons from the C=O bond shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n    3.  This intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final product.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    Donor: `(H₃COOC)₂CH⁻`\n    Acceptor: `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`\n    Product: `(H₃COOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`\n*   **Product Name (A):** The product is a triester. To name it systematically, we can consider the propane chain formed by the α-carbon of the malonate, and the β- and α-carbons of the acrylate.\n    - C1 from the malonate (with two -COOCH₃ groups).\n    - C2 from the acrylate's β-carbon (with the p-tolyl group).\n    - C3 from the acrylate's α-carbon (which becomes a CH₂). There is also a -COOCH₃ group attached to the chain derived from the original acrylate's ester group.\n    A common way to name such adducts is as a substituted propane tricarboxylate.\n    The structure `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe` can be named **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This name correctly identifies the propane backbone with carboxylate groups at positions 1, 1, and 3, and a p-tolyl substituent at position 2.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and serve as potent carbon nucleophiles at the α-carbon (C2 of the original cyclohexanone).\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH=CH-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (the CH attached to the methyl group) is the electrophilic center.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    1.  The α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    2.  This forms an iminium salt of the Michael adduct.\n    3.  The final step is hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺), which cleaves the iminium salt and regenerates the ketone.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    A new C-C bond is formed between the C2 of the cyclohexanone ring and the C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    The substituent added to the cyclohexanone ring is `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    After hydrolysis, the product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n    Product: 2-(1-cyanopropan-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Product Name (B):** A more systematic name is to consider the compound as a substituted butanenitrile. The parent chain is butanenitrile. At position 3, there is a (2-oxocyclohexyl) group.\n    The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\nThis is a retrosynthesis problem where we need to identify the starting material 'C'.\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Reagent:** KOH (a base).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Michael addition. The product is formed by adding a Michael donor (from C) to the Michael acceptor (MVK).\n    - **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one, CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (the terminal CH₂).\n    - **Formation of the side chain:** When a nucleophile (Nu⁻) attacks MVK, the resulting group after protonation is `Nu-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`. This corresponds to the `-(3-oxobutyl)` group attached to the main ring in the product.\n    - **Michael Donor (C):** The `Nu-` part in our product is the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring attached at C2. Therefore, the nucleophile must be the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are particularly acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by resonance with two carbonyl groups.\n*   **Reactant Name (C):** The reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n-   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n-   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n-   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** Michael Addition\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the acidic α-carbon (the CH₂ group flanked by two esters) to form a resonance-stabilized enolate,⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure is p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester. The resulting intermediate is then protonated by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent on the α-carbon.\n    1.  **Attack:**  ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ attacks the β-carbon.\n    2.  **Product Formation:** A new C-C bond forms between the malonate carbon and the β-carbon of the acrylate. The α-carbon gets a hydrogen.\n        *   Product Structure: p-tolyl-CH[CH(COOCH₃)₂]-CH₂-COOCH₃. This can be drawn as (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂COOCH₃.\n*   **Naming Product (A):** This structure can be named systematically, though the common name provided in the options is a bit tricky. Let's analyze the name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    *   This name considers a three-carbon chain as the backbone, connecting the three carboxylate functionalities.\n    *   **C1:** The malonate carbon, `CH(COOCH₃)₂`. It has two ester groups (hence `1,1-`).\n    *   **C2:** The β-carbon from the acrylate, `CH(p-tolyl)`. It has the p-tolyl substituent (hence `2-(p-tolyl)`).\n    *   **C3:** The α-carbon from the acrylate, which becomes a `CH₂` group. The original ester of the acrylate is now attached to this position (hence `3-tricarboxylate`).\n    *   Connecting these gives `(CH₃OOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)(p-tolyl)-CH₂(3)COOCH₃`. This structure matches the one derived from the reaction mechanism.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** Stork Enamine Alkylation (a variant of Michael Addition).\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The β-carbon to the nitrogen (C2 of the cyclohexene ring) is the nucleophilic center.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile). The structure is CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    2.  This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    3.  An acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n*   **Product Formation (B):**\n    *   The original cyclohexanone ring is regenerated.\n    *   A new substituent is attached at the α-position (C2) of the cyclohexanone.\n    *   The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile: the `CH₃-CH` group is attacked, and the `CH-CN` is protonated, yielding a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` chain.\n    *   The final product is cyclohexanone with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at position 2.\n*   **Naming Product (B):** The principal functional group is the nitrile (CN). The main chain is a butanenitrile. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on carbon 3 of the nitrile chain. The substituent is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major stable product after acidic workup, not the enol form.\n\n### Reaction C\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** Michael Addition (working backwards).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (Methyl Vinyl Ketone, MVK). Structure: CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃.\n*   **Mechanism (Retro-Michael):** A Michael addition involves forming a bond between a nucleophile (from reactant C) and the β-carbon of the acceptor (MVK).\n    *   The fragment added from MVK is `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-CO-CH₃`. This is a `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   The product name shows this `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to the C2 position of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` molecule.\n    *   The C2 position of a 1,3-dione (`-CO-CH₂-CO-`) is highly acidic. In the presence of a base (KOH), it is readily deprotonated to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Identifying Reactant (C):** The nucleophile that adds to MVK must be the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   Therefore, the starting reactant **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMatching the identified compounds with the given options:\n*   **A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(CO₂Me)₂.

The electrophilic site for Michael addition is the β-carbon.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate, ⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂, attacks the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The double bond electrons shift, and after workup (protonation from the solvent, EtOH), the α-carbon gets a proton.\n    *   The new C-C bond forms between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n\n3.  **Determine Product Structure (A):**\n    *   The fragment from the donor is -CH(CO₂Me)₂.\n    *   The fragment from the acceptor is p-tolyl-CH-CH₂-CO₂Me.\n    *   Combining these gives the product: **p-tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂) -CH₂-CO₂Me**.\n\n4.  **Name the Product (A):**\n    *   Let's analyze the name given in option A: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n    *   This name implies a propane chain (C1-C2-C3) with substituents. Let's build the structure from the name:\n        *   Propane backbone: C1-C2-C3\n        *   At C1: two methoxycarbonyl groups, -CH(CO₂Me)₂.\n        *   At C2: a p-tolyl group.\n        *   At C3: one methoxycarbonyl group, this must be on a methylene attached to the chain, so let's interpret it as `HOOC-CH2-`, so `-CH2COOMe`.\n        *   If we define the main chain starting from the malonate carbon, `C1 = CH(CO₂Me)₂`, `C2 = CH(p-tolyl)`, and `C3 = CH₂`, and there's a `CO₂Me` on the end. A plausible interpretation of this non-standard name leads to the structure `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n    *   This structure matches our derived product. The name in option B (`3-(p-tolyl)...`) would imply the p-tolyl group is at the other end of the chain, which would result from an incorrect addition to the α-carbon. Thus, the product name in option A is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN.

The parent chain is butanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the chain: N≡C(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(substituent)-C(4)H₃.\n    *   The substituent at C3 is the `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    *   Therefore, the product name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n    *   The keto form is more stable than the enol form (`3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`), so it is the major final product after acidic workup.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we need to identify the starting Michael donor, C.\n    *   **Product:** `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This means a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring has a `-(CH₂)₂-CO-CH₃` group at position C2.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** `but-3-en-2-one` is methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the acceptor (MVK) is attacked by a nucleophile at its β-carbon (`CH₂=`). The resulting fragment added to the nucleophile is `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, which is exactly the `3-oxobutyl` group found in the product.\n\n2.  **Identify Reactant C:**\n    *   Since the `3-oxobutyl` group comes from MVK, the rest of the molecule must be the Michael donor.\n    *   The `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to C2 of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system.\n    *   The hydrogens on C2 of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` are very acidic because the C2 carbon is located between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates this C2 position to form a highly stabilized enolate, which then acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   Therefore, reactant **C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nComparing this with the given options, all three parts match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂.

This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃.

Despite the likely error in the provided IUPAC name for product A, the combination of correct answers for B and C makes D the only logical choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n*   **Reagents:** NaOEt, EtOH (Sodium ethoxide in ethanol)\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition\n\n1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, which is acidic due to the two adjacent ester groups. This forms a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic. Its structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`.\n3.  **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons shift, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n    `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃  →  (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-⁻CH-COOCH₃` (This is one resonance structure of the intermediate enolate).\n4.  **Protonation:** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to yield the final product.\n    `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-⁻CH-COOCH₃ + EtOH → (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n5.  **Product A:** The structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`. This compound can be named as a substituted propane tricarboxylate. The IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n*   **Reagents:** MeOH, H₃O⁺\n*   **Type:** Stork Enamine Synthesis (which involves a Michael Addition)\n\n1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (the C2 position of the cyclohexene ring).\n2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile, `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n3.  **Reaction:** The α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion and a new C-C bond.\n4.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) first protonates the intermediate anion and then hydrolyzes the iminium salt back to a carbonyl group. The piperidine is removed, and a ketone is formed at the C1 position of the cyclohexane ring.\n5.  **Product B:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position. The added group is `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`. So the structure is 2-substituted cyclohexanone. Naming it as a derivative of butanenitrile, it becomes **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Reagents:** KOH, H₂O\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition (Retrosynthesis)\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Reaction:** We need to find the starting material 'C'. The reaction is a Michael addition. This reaction forms a bond between a nucleophile (the donor) and the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl/nitrile compound (the acceptor).\n2.  **Identify Donor and Acceptor fragments:** The acceptor is given as but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`. In a Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (`CH₂=`). After protonation, the MVK fragment becomes `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n3.  **Match Fragments:** This `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` fragment is exactly the (3-oxobutyl) group attached at the C2 position of the product, `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n4.  **Identify Reactant C:** Therefore, the Michael donor ('C') must be the other part of the product: **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic methylene group at C2 (between the two carbonyls) to generate the nucleophilic enolate that initiates the reaction. The most appropriate way to write the starting material is in its neutral diketone form.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A:**\n**dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify Nucleophile and Electrophile:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂.

This forms an iminium salt intermediate.\n    *   The subsequent workup with acid (`H₃O⁺`) has two effects: it protonates the nitrile-derived carbanion and hydrolyzes the iminium salt back to a carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2) with the group derived from the butenenitrile.\n    *   The butenenitrile `CH₃-CH=CH-CN` becomes the `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` substituent.\n    *   The product structure is `2-(-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN)cyclohexan-1-one`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product:**\n    *   Naming this structure with butanenitrile as the parent chain: The chain is `N≡C-CH₂-CH-CH₃`. Numbering from the nitrile `C` as C1, we get a butanenitrile backbone.\n    *   The `cyclohexanone` ring is a substituent at C3, attached via its C2 position. The substituent is named `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Full name: `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. The keto tautomer is more stable than the enol (`2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl`) form, making this the major final product.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Known Reactant (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This means a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` skeleton has a `-(CH₂)₂-C(=O)CH₃` group at its C2 position.\n    *   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** `but-3-en-2-one` (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Unknown Reactant C:**\n    *   In a Michael addition, the bond forms between the Michael donor's nucleophilic carbon and the Michael acceptor's β-carbon.\n    *   The fragment from the acceptor (MVK) in the product is `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-C(=O)CH₃`, which corresponds to the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   Therefore, the Michael donor (`C`) must be the rest of the molecule, which is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system.\n    *   The C2 position of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` is highly acidic due to the two flanking carbonyl groups. The base (`KOH`) deprotonates it to form the required nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Thus, reactant `C` is **`cyclohexane-1,3-dione`**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options, we find that option D matches all three parts correctly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nThis question asks to determine the products of two Michael addition reactions (A and B) and the nucleophilic reactant of a third Michael addition reaction (C).\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, `CH2(COOCH3)2`. In the presence of a base (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton is removed to form a nucleophilic enolate: `[-]CH(COOCH3)2`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH3`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    2.  A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    3.  The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) during workup.\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The nucleophile `[-]CH(COOCH3)2` adds to the `CH` group bearing the `p-tolyl` group.\n    *   The resulting product structure is: `(CH3OOC)2CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOCH3`.\n*   **Product Naming:** The options provide systematic names based on a propane-tricarboxylate backbone. Let's analyze the product structure in that context. We can identify a 3-carbon chain linking the carboxylate groups.\n    *   `C1`: The carbon from the malonate, bearing two methoxycarbonyl groups (`-CH(COOMe)2`).\n    *   `C2`: The β-carbon from the acrylate, bearing the `p-tolyl` group.\n    *   `C3`: The α-carbon from the acrylate, which becomes a `CH2` group attached to the third methoxycarbonyl group (`-CH2-COOMe`).\n    *   Thus, we have a propane chain where C1 has two carboxylates, C3 has one carboxylate, and C2 has a p-tolyl substituent.\n    *   This corresponds to the name: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This matches the name for product A in options A and B.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine reaction, a variation of the Michael addition.\n*   **Michael Donor:** The enamine, `1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine`, is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The carbon atom β to the nitrogen atom (C2 of the cyclohexene ring) is the nucleophilic center.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile, `CH3-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    2.  This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    3.  The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (`H3O+`) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a ketone. The nitrile group is stable to these hydrolysis conditions.\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The overall reaction achieves the alkylation of the cyclohexanone at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The alkyl group added is derived from the Michael acceptor, `CH3-CH=CH-CN`. After the addition and protonation, it becomes the `–CH(CH3)CH2CN` group.\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone: a cyclohexane ring with a `=O` at C1 and the `–CH(CH3)CH2CN` group at C2.\n*   **Product Naming:**\n    *   The main functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`), so the parent name is butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituent on the butanenitrile chain is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    *   Numbering the butanenitrile chain from the nitrile carbon (`CN` is C1), the substituent `(-CH(CH3)-)` is at C3.\n    *   Thus, the product name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. This corresponds to product B in options A and B. The alternative `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile` represents the enol tautomer, which is generally less stable and not the major product after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a retrosynthesis problem for a Michael addition.\n*   **Product:** `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** `but-3-en-2-one` (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH2(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH3`.\n*   **Retrosynthesis:** A Michael addition forms a bond between the α-carbon of a nucleophile (donor) and the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated system (acceptor).\n    1.  Identify the fragment from the Michael acceptor in the product. MVK (`CH2=CH-CO-CH3`) adds to become a `–CH2–CH2–CO–CH3` group. This matches the `(3-oxobutyl)` substituent in the product.\n    2.  The new C-C bond is between the β-carbon of MVK (now the first `CH2` of the oxobutyl group) and C2 of the cyclohexane ring.\n    3.  This means the nucleophile (donor) must have been the enolate of the remaining fragment.\n    4.  The remaining fragment is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system. The enolate is formed by removing the highly acidic proton from C2, which is positioned between two carbonyl groups.\n*   **Reactant C:** The starting material C that forms this enolate upon treatment with base (KOH) is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n*   **B** is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.\n*   **C** is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n\nThis set of reactants and products corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The carbon-carbon double bond is activated by the electron-withdrawing ester group, making the β-carbon electrophilic. The numbering is `p-tolyl-CβH=CαH-COOMe`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The electron pair from the C=C double bond shifts to the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - C⁻H-COOCH₃`.\n    *   This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) or during workup to yield the final product. The proton adds to the α-carbon.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The new C-C bond is formed between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   Let's analyze the name given in the options. The name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" can be deconstructed. We can interpret this as a substituted propane tricarboxylic acid methyl ester. The base structure would be a trimethyl propanetricarboxylate, with a p-tolyl group at position 2. If we consider the chain C1-C2-C3, with two carboxylates on C1, one on C3, and a tolyl group on C2, we get the structure: `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n    *   This structure is identical to the one we derived from the reaction mechanism.\n    *   Therefore, A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an **enamine** of cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nitrogen analogs of enolates and are excellent nucleophiles. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system, which is C2 of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, making its β-carbon (`CH₃-CH=`) electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   The enamine's nucleophilic β-carbon attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms an iminium ion and a new C-C bond.\n    *   The intermediate is then subjected to acidic aqueous workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   The workup step protonates the α-carbon of the nitrile group and hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a new substituent at its α-carbon (C2).\n    *   The substituent is derived from butenenitrile: the β-carbon is attached to the ring, and the α-carbon gets a proton. The fragment is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   So, the product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group at C2.\n    *   Let's name this product from the nitrile's perspective. The main chain is a butanenitrile: `N≡C(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`. There is a substituent on C3.\n    *   The substituent is the cyclohexanone ring, attached via C2, so it's a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   The full name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n    *   The other option for B is the enol tautomer, which is generally less stable than the keto form for a simple ketone, especially after acidic workup.\n    *   This confirms that product B is correct in options B and C.\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactant C through Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we are given the product and need to find one of the reactants (the Michael donor, C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This means a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring is substituted at C2 with a `3-oxobutyl` group (`-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   **Reaction Analysis:** In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the acceptor. After protonation of the α-carbon, the MVK fragment becomes `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`, which is exactly the `3-oxobutyl` group we see in the product.\n    *   This means the C-C bond was formed between the nucleophile and the β-carbon of MVK. The product shows this bond is at C2 of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of Reactant C:**\n    *   The nucleophile must be the enolate of reactant C. Since the product is built on a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` framework, C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The methylene protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic because they are flanked by two carbonyl groups. The base (KOH) easily removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, which then acts as the Michael donor.\n    *   This confirms reactant C in options A and B.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   From reaction A, product A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. (Matches Options B, C)\n*   From reaction B, product B is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. (Matches Options B, C)\n*   From reaction C, reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.

The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), removes one of these protons to form a stabilized enolate: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** The Michael acceptor is the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`, is an α,β-unsaturated ester.

The group added to the cyclohexanone ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 (alpha) position with a `-(CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN)` group.\n    *   To name this product, we consider the butanenitrile as the principal chain: `CN(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(C3)-CH₃(C4)`.\n    *   The substituent at position C3 is a cyclohexanone ring attached via its C2 position.

The alternative product, involving an enol (`3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`), is less stable and not the major product isolated after acidic hydrolysis.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   We are given the product and the Michael acceptor and need to find the Michael donor (reactant C). This is a retrosynthesis problem.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   A Michael addition forms a bond between the nucleophilic donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor. The β-carbon of MVK is the `CH₂` group.\n    *   The fragment from MVK that is incorporated into the product is `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`. This matches the `(3-oxobutyl)` group in the product's name.\n    *   This group is attached to the C2 position of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n\n2.  **Identify Reactant (C):**\n    *   The new C-C bond is between C2 of the dione ring and the former β-carbon of MVK. This means that C2 of the dione must have acted as the nucleophile.\n    *   The protons at C2 of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione are flanked by two carbonyl groups, making them highly acidic (pKa ≈ 11). The base (KOH) easily deprotonates this position to form a stabilized enolate.\n    *   This enolate is the active Michael donor.\n    *   Therefore, the starting material C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The other option, \"2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione,\" is not a standard reactant and is an ambiguous name (it's likely meant to represent the enol tautomer, 3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one, but the diketone is the conventional starting material).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given choices, option B matches all three correctly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reactants**: Dimethyl malonate (`CH2(COOMe)2`), methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOMe`), and a base (NaOEt in EtOH).\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile)**: Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the mixture. The α-protons of dimethyl malonate (between the two ester groups) are highly acidic. NaOEt will remove one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `[-]CH(COOMe)2`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile)**: Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The carbon-carbon double bond is activated by the electron-withdrawing ester group, making the β-carbon electrophilic.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`\n*   **Mechanism**: The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and then the carbonyl π-electrons shift to the oxygen to form an intermediate enolate. This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to give the final neutral product.\n    1.  **Attack**: `[-]CH(COOMe)2` attacks the β-carbon (`p-Tolyl-CH-`).\n    2.  **Bond Formation**: A new C-C bond forms between the carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    3.  **Protonation**: The α-carbon gets a proton from the solvent.\n*   **Product (A) Structure**: The structure of the product is `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)2)-CH2-COOMe`.\n*   **Matching with Options**: We need to identify which of the given names corresponds to this structure.\n    *   The options distinguish between two isomers based on the position of the `p-tolyl` group relative to the ester groups on a \"propane-tricarboxylate\" skeleton.\n    *   **Structure from options B/C**: `trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate`. Let's analyze the connectivity: `p-tolyl-CH2 - CH(COOMe) - CH(COOMe)2`. This would be the result of the malonate nucleophile attacking the α-carbon of the acrylate, which is not a Michael addition.\n    *   **Structure from options A/D**: `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`. Let's analyze the connectivity: `(MeOOC)2CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH2COOMe`. This structure matches the one we derived from the correct Michael addition mechanism (β-attack).\n*   **Conclusion for A**: Product A is `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n**Part 2: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reactants**: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`), followed by acidic workup (MeOH, H3O+).\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition using an enamine as the nucleophile (a process often part of the Stork enamine alkylation).\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile)**: The enamine, `1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine`, is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. It acts as a neutral, \"pre-formed\" enolate equivalent. The nucleophilic carbon is the one β to the nitrogen atom (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile)**: (E)-but-2-enenitrile is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (`CH3-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`).\n*   **Mechanism**: The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium ion. The subsequent acidic workup (H3O+) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone.\n*   **Product (B) Structure**: The net result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at its α-position. The group added is derived from the Michael acceptor. The `CH3-CH=CH-CN` fragment becomes a `-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN` substituent. The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with this substituent at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The systematic name for this product is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.\n*   **Matching with Options**:\n    *   **Options A/D**: `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. This matches our derived product, which is in its stable keto form.\n    *   **Options B/C**: `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`. This is the enol tautomer of the product. The keto form is generally more stable and is considered the major final product unless conditions specifically favor the enol.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: Product B is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. This is consistent with options A and D.\n\n**Part 3: Analyze Reaction C**\n\n*   **Reactants**: An unknown reactant C + but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Product**: 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition where we need to identify the donor. We can solve this using retrosynthesis (working backward from the product).\n*   **Retrosynthesis**: The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The parent structure is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The substituent at C2 is `-(CH2)-(CH2)-C(=O)CH3`, which is the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   This substituent is derived from the Michael acceptor, but-3-en-2-one (`CH2=CH-C(=O)CH3`). The reaction added a proton to the α-carbon and formed a bond at the β-carbon. This matches.\n    *   The C-C bond formed during the reaction is between C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring and the β-carbon of the MVK.\n    *   This implies that the nucleophile was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The protons at C2 of this molecule are exceptionally acidic, as they are located between two carbonyl groups.\n*   **Reactant C Structure**: The Michael donor, reactant C, must therefore be `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The base (KOH) deprotonates it at C2 to generate the nucleophile needed for the reaction.\n*   **Matching with Options**:\n    *   **Option A**: Reactant C is `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This is an incorrect starting material.\n    *   **Option D**: Reactant C is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This is the correct starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for C**: Reactant C is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A corresponds to the name in options A and D.\n*   Product B corresponds to the name in options A and D.\n*   Reactant C corresponds to the name in option D.\n\nTherefore, all three parts are correctly described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere's a breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. The α-carbon is `CH-COOCH₃` and the β-carbon is `p-Tolyl-CH`.\n*   **Base/Solvent:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH).\n\n**Mechanism:**\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The base, NaOEt, deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.\n3.  **Protonation:** The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final neutral product.\n\n**Product Structure Analysis:**\n*   The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n*   The atoms involved are: `(MeOOC)₂CH⁻` + `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe` → `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH⁻-COOMe`\n*   After protonation: `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`\n*   This structure needs to be named. Let's examine the options. The name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` can be constructed as follows:\n    *   **Propane chain:** `C1-C2-C3`\n    *   **Substituents:** Two `-COOMe` groups on C1, a `-p-tolyl` group on C2, and one `-COOMe` group on C3.\n    *   To satisfy valency, this forms the structure: `(MeOOC)₂CH(1)-CH(p-tolyl)(2)-CH₂(3)COOMe`.\n    *   This naming convention, where a COOMe group is part of the chain name, is not standard IUPAC practice for this type of molecule, but it describes the correct connectivity derived from the reaction mechanism. Thus, we accept this as product **A**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon relative to the nitrogen.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH) as a solvent and H₃O⁺ for workup.\n\n**Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n1.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n2.  **Intermediate Formation:** This forms a new C-C bond, resulting in an iminium ion on the cyclohexene ring and a carbanion on the nitrile part, which gets protonated by MeOH.\n3.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n**Product Structure Analysis:**\n*   The original cyclohexanone ring is recovered.\n*   A new substituent is added at the α-position (C2) of the cyclohexanone.\n*   The substituent is derived from butenenitrile: `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n*   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone. The systematic name is based on the longest chain, which is the butanenitrile chain. The `2-oxocyclohexyl` group is a substituent on the butanenitrile.\n*   The attachment is at carbon 3 of the butanenitrile chain: `CH₃-CH(substituent)-CH₂-CN`.\n*   Therefore, the product **B** is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. The keto form (`oxo`) is the stable product after hydrolysis, not the enol (`hydroxycyclohexenyl`).\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Reactant **C**\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** But-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n*   **Base/Solvent:** KOH in H₂O.\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\n**Mechanism (Retrosynthesis):**\n1.  **Identify the pieces:** The Michael addition connects a donor nucleophile to an acceptor. The part of the product derived from the acceptor (MVK) is `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, which is a `3-oxobutyl` group.\n2.  **Identify the donor:** The `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to C2 of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring. This means the original nucleophile was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The starting material **C** (the Michael donor) must be `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The protons on C2, located between the two carbonyl groups, are very acidic and are easily removed by KOH to form the nucleophilic enolate. The structure `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` is the standard representation of the keto form, even though it exists in equilibrium with its enol tautomer (`3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one`).\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions:\n\n### Reaction A:\n**dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants**:\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile)**: Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic proton on the α-carbon (the carbon between the two carbonyl groups) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: [⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂].\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile)**: Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the one attached to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition)**:\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is another enolate, [p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃], which is stabilized by resonance.\n    *   This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine Product (A)**:\n    *   The final product structure is p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃.\n    *   To name this using the \"propane-tricarboxylate\" system, we identify the main 3-carbon chain linking the carboxylate groups.\n    *   The structure can be seen as: (MeOOC)₂-C¹H - C²H(p-tolyl) - C³H₂-COOMe.\n    *   Numbering this chain C1-C2-C3, we have:\n        *   Two methyl carboxylate groups on C1.\n        *   A p-tolyl group on C2.\n        *   One methyl carboxylate group on C3.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n**1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants**:\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile)**: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a neutral enolate equivalent (a Stork enamine). The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine double bond (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile)**: (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH=CH-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation)**:\n    *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a new C-C bond.\n    *   The final step involves hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone) and protonates the piperidine, removing it from the molecule.\n\n3.  **Determine Product (B)**:\n    *   The starting enamine was formed from cyclohexanone. The reaction regenerates a ketone, so the product is a substituted cyclohexanone.\n    *   The substituent is attached at the α-position (C2) relative to the new carbonyl group.\n    *   The substituent is derived from the but-2-enenitrile: -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN group at C2.\n    *   The IUPAC name is based on the butanenitrile chain, with a (2-oxocyclohexyl) group at position 3. So the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, most stable product after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C:\n**C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the transformation**: We are given the product and need to identify the Michael donor (reactant C).\n    *   **Product**: 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This means a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring has a (3-oxobutyl) group, -CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃, attached at its C2 position.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃. In a Michael addition, this becomes the -CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃ group.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Reactant C)**: The reaction forms a C-C bond between the C2 of the dione and the β-carbon of MVK. This means the nucleophile was an enolate formed at the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. The proton at C2 is highly acidic as it is flanked by two carbonyl groups.\n\n2.  **Determine Reactant (C)**:\n    *   The nucleophile is generated by deprotonating reactant C with the base (KOH).\n    *   Since the core of the product is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, and the C2 position acted as the nucleophile, reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   **A**: trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B**: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C**: cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing this with the given options, we find that all three match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the acidic α-carbon between the two ester groups to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃.

This can be viewed as a substituted propane chain with three methyl carboxylate groups.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. Let's verify this name against the structure:\n        *   Propane chain: C1-C2-C3.\n        *   Two ester groups on C1 (`-CH(COOCH₃)₂`).\n        *   A p-tolyl group on C2.\n        *   An ester group on C3 (from `-CH₂-COOCH₃`).\n        *   The structure matches the name `(COOCH₃)₂CH(1) - CH(p-tolyl)(2) - CH₂(3)COOCH₃`.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, pre-formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. In the Stork enamine reaction, the enamine acts as the nucleophile. The nucleophilic carbon is the α-carbon of the parent ketone (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enamine's α-carbon attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium salt intermediate.\n    *   The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Identify the Product (B):**\n    *   The final product is cyclohexanone substituted at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The substituent added is derived from but-2-enenitrile. The new C-C bond forms between C2 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (C3) of the butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituent group is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The structure of the product is a cyclohexanone ring with the `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group attached at C2.\n    *   Naming this molecule based on the butanenitrile parent chain gives **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The acidic workup ensures the final product is the keto form, not the enol form.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and the Acceptor (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃.\n    *   The bond formed in a Michael addition is between the β-carbon of the acceptor and the α-carbon of the donor.\n    *   Upon reaction, the `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃` group becomes the `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-CO-CH₃` substituent, which is the `3-oxobutyl` group mentioned in the product name.\n    *   This means the fragment `2-(...)cyclohexane-1,3-dione` must have come from the Michael donor, reactant C.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reactant (C):**\n    *   The nucleophile in this reaction must be the enolate formed from the starting material C.

Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon of the original ketone (the C2 position of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH=CH-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (the one bonded to the methyl group) is the electrophilic site.\n    *   **Reagents:** The reaction is first run in a solvent like MeOH, followed by an acidic aqueous workup (H₃O⁺) to hydrolyze the intermediate.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Nucleophilic Attack):** The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The lone pair on the nitrogen atom moves to form a C=N⁺ double bond (an iminium ion), and the C=C double bond of the enamine performs the attack.\n    *   **Step 2 (Intermediate formation and protonation):** This forms an iminium ion intermediate with a newly formed C-C bond and a carbanion on the α-carbon of the nitrile. The carbanion is protonated (by MeOH) to give a substituted iminium salt.\n    *   **Step 3 (Hydrolysis):** The addition of H₃O⁺ hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone), regenerating the cyclohexanone structure and producing a protonated piperidine salt.\n\n3.  **Identify Product B:**\n    *   The reaction attaches the fragment from butenenitrile to the C2 position (α-position) of the cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   The butenenitrile fragment becomes `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone: 2-(-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN)cyclohexanone.\n    *   Let's find the correct name for this structure.

The product has a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` core and a `3-oxobutyl` side chain (`-CH₂CH₂C(=O)CH₃`) at position 2.\n        3.  The `3-oxobutyl` group comes from the Michael acceptor, but-3-en-2-one, after it accepts the nucleophile and gets protonated.\n        4.  Therefore, the nucleophile (Michael donor) must be the enolate of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` core.\n        5.  Reactant C is deprotonated by KOH at the highly acidic C2 position (between the two carbonyls) to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n        6.  This enolate then attacks the MVK to form the product.\n    *   **Identity of C:**\n        *   Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n        *   Option C states that C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n        *   Option D states that C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which is not the correct starting material.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n    *   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n    *   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination of reactants and products corresponds exactly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products of the given Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate (`CH₂(COOMe)₂`) and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOMe`).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH). NaOEt is a strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Michael Addition.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate has acidic α-protons (pKa ≈ 13) located on the carbon between the two ester groups. The base, NaOEt, deprotonates it to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, `⁻CH(COOMe)₂`. This is the nucleophile.\n\n    `CH₂(COOMe)₂ + NaOEt <=> [⁻CH(COOMe)₂]Na⁺ + EtOH`\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The presence of the electron-withdrawing ester group makes the C=C double bond electrophilic, particularly at the β-carbon.\n\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`\n\n3.  **Mechanism (1,4-Conjugate Addition):** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and then onto the carbonyl oxygen, forming another enolate intermediate. Subsequent protonation by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon yields the final product.\n\n    *   **Step 1 (Attack):** `⁻CH(COOMe)₂` attacks `p-Tolyl-CH(β)`.\n    *   **Step 2 (Intermediate):** `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂)-CH=C(O⁻)OMe` (enolate) is formed.\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The enolate is protonated by EtOH at the α-carbon.\n\n4.  **Final Product (A):** The final structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n\n    *   **Naming the Product:** This is a tricarboxylic acid ester. The most systematic IUPAC name can be complex. However, we can use a common naming convention based on a propane chain. Let's consider the 3-carbon chain connecting the carboxyl groups: `C(malonate)-C(β)-C(α)`.\n        *   C1: The original malonate carbon, `-CH-`, is bonded to two `-COOMe` groups.\n        *   C2: The original β-carbon, `-CH-`, is bonded to a `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   C3: The original α-carbon, `-CH₂-`, is bonded to one `-COOMe` group.\n    *   Numbering this chain from C1 to C3: `(MeOOC)₂-C1H - C2H(p-tolyl) - C3H₂-COOMe`. Wait, this seems wrong. Let's number from the other end.\n    *   Numbering the propane backbone as C1(α)-C2(β)-C3(malonate):\n        *   C1(-CH₂-) is attached to a `-COOMe` group.\n        *   C2(-CH-) is attached to a `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   C3(-CH-) is attached to two `-COOMe` groups.\n    *   In this polycarboxylic acid naming system, the carbons of the `COOH` groups are not part of the main chain. So the main chain is propane. The carboxylate groups are at positions 1, 3, and 3. `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,3,3-tricarboxylate`. This doesn't match the options.\n    *   Let's try numbering the longest chain containing C(malonate), C(beta) and C(alpha): C1(malonate)-C2(beta)-C3(alpha). `C1H(COOMe)₂ - C2H(p-tolyl) - C3H₂COOMe`. If this is named as substituted methyl propanoate, it would be `methyl 2-[bis(methoxycarbonyl)methyl]-3-(p-tolyl)propanoate`.\n    *   Let's analyze the name provided in option A: `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`. This name implies a propane chain (C1-C2-C3) with two carboxylate groups at C1 and one at C3. A `p-tolyl` group is at C2. Structure: `(MeOOC)₂C1-C2H(p-tolyl)-C3H₂-COOMe`. This structure can be formed if the Michael donor `CH(COOMe)₂` attacks the β-carbon `CH(p-tolyl)`. Let's assume the hydrogen from malonate is also lost (e.g., through oxidation) which is not supported by the reaction condition.\n    *   Let's re-examine our product structure: `(MeOOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂-COOMe`. Let the chain be C(alpha)-C(beta)-C(malonate), numbering as C1-C2-C3. The substituents are: one COOMe at C1, a p-tolyl at C2, and two COOMe groups at C3. This leads to `...-propane-1,3,3-tricarboxylate`. This is still not matching.\n    *   There must be an unconventional naming or a mistake in the options' names. Let's retrace the connection points which are unambiguous: malonate `C` connects to acrylate `β-C`. Product is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂(α)-COOMe`. Comparing `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` with `trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate`, the former corresponds to a `1,4` Michael adduct, while the latter would correspond to a `1,2` adduct to the carbonyl group which is incorrect. So, despite the possibly confusing name, `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` represents the correct connectivity for the Michael addition product.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`).\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH) as solvent, followed by aqueous acid workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Stork Enamine Synthesis (a variant of Michael Addition).\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nitrogen's lone pair increases the electron density of the double bond, making the β-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring) nucleophilic.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site. `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n\n3.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Attack):** The nucleophilic C2 of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    *   **Step 2 (Hydrolysis):** The aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt. The C=N⁺ bond is cleaved and converted back into a carbonyl group (C=O), regenerating the ketone. Piperidine is liberated as piperidinium ion.\n\n4.  **Final Product (B):** The result is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2) with the fragment from the nitrile. The added fragment is `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   **Product Structure:** 2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n    *   **Naming the Product:** The molecule can be named as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is the 4-carbon nitrile: `C4H₃-C3H-C2H₂-C1N`. At C3, a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group is attached. Therefore, the name is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. The hydrolysis step ensures the final product is the ketone, not the enol or enamine.\n\n### Reaction C\n\n*   **Reactants:** An unknown compound **C** and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK, `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`).\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water (H₂O).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Michael Addition (in reverse).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product:** The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The substituent at position 2 is a `3-oxobutyl` group (`-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reactants:** One reactant is the Michael acceptor, but-3-en-2-one (`CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`). After the reaction, this becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` side chain. The bond is formed at the β-carbon.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C (Michael Donor):** The reaction forms a bond between the donor's nucleophilic carbon and the acceptor's β-carbon.\n    *   In the product, the `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to C2 of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The methylene protons at C2 of this dione are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 5) because they are flanked by two carbonyl groups. The base KOH easily deprotonates it.\n    *   So, reactant **C** must be `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **A:** The product is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   **B:** The product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   **C:** The reactant is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   **A) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n*   B) A = ..., B = ..., C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (enol tautomer)\n*   C) A = ... 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate (wrong adduct), B = ... (enol form), C = ... (enol form)\n*   D) A = ... 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate (wrong adduct), B = ... (enol form), C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nOption A correctly identifies all three species according to the standard representations and outcomes of these reactions.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile Source):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH2(COOCH3)2`. The two hydrogens on the central carbon (α-hydrogens) are highly acidic because the resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by resonance with both adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Base:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that deprotonates the dimethyl malonate to form the nucleophilic enolate: `Na+ [CH(COOCH3)2]−`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tol-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH3`, where `p-Tol` is a p-tolyl group (a benzene ring substituted with a methyl group at the para position). The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Enolate formation:** `CH2(COOCH3)2 + NaOEt → Na+ [CH(COOCH3)2]− + EtOH`\n    *   **Step 2: Michael Addition:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The π electrons from the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, and then onto the carbonyl oxygen, forming a new, resonance-stabilized enolate.\n        *   `p-Tol-CH(β)=CH-COOCH3 + [CH(COOCH3)2]− → p-Tol-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH=C(O−)OCH3` (one resonance form of the intermediate enolate).\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation:** The intermediate enolate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final, stable product.\n        *   `p-Tol-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-C−H-COOCH3 + EtOH → p-Tol-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH2-COOCH3 + EtO−`\n\n3.  **Identify Product A:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `(CH3OOC)2CH-CH(p-Tol)-CH2-COOCH3`.\n    *   Let's name this compound based on the options. The name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` describes a propane chain `(C3-C2-C1)` with substituents.\n        *   At C1: Two methoxycarbonyl (`-COOCH3`) groups.\n        *   At C2: One p-tolyl group.\n        *   At C3: One methoxycarbonyl group.\n        *   Let's build this structure: `(CH3OOC)-CH2(C3)-CH(p-Tol)(C2)-CH(COOCH3)2(C1)`.\n    *   This structure matches our derived product. Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which is a variant of the Michael addition. The enamine acts as the Michael donor.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH3-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n    *   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is followed by an acidic workup (`H3O+`).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and generates an iminium ion intermediate and a carbanion stabilized by the nitrile group.\n    *   **Step 2: Protonation:** The carbanion is protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n    *   **Step 3: Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (`H3O+`) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a ketone. The overall result is the alkylation of the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone).\n\n3.  **Identify Product B:**\n    *   The starting ketone is cyclohexanone. The alkylating agent is derived from `CH3-CH=CH-CN`.\n    *   The group added to the α-carbon (C2) of cyclohexanone is `-CH(CH3)-CH2CN`.\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n    *   Let's name this product: The principal functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`), which has higher priority than a ketone. The main chain is a butanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile: `N≡C(1)-C(2)H2-C(3)H(subst.)-C(4)H3`.\n    *   The substituent at C3 is the `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    *   Therefore, the name is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.\n    *   The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, is the enol tautomer. Under acidic hydrolysis conditions, the keto form is the major, stable product.\n    *   Thus, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### **Reaction 3: (C)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where we need to identify the starting Michael donor (C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH2=CH-COCH3`.\n    *   **Base:** KOH in water.\n\n2.  **Determine Reactant C using Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   \"Break\" the molecule at the bond formed during the Michael addition. This is the bond between the Michael donor and the Michael acceptor.\n    *   The fragment from the acceptor (MVK) is the `3-oxobutyl` group (`-CH2-CH2-COCH3`). This group comes from the addition to `CH2(β)=CH(α)-COCH3`, where a nucleophile adds to the β-carbon and a proton adds to the α-carbon.\n    *   The bond is formed between C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Therefore, the Michael donor (reactant C) must be the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` part.\n    *   The hydrogens at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic (they are α to two carbonyl groups) and are readily removed by the base (KOH) to form a highly stabilized enolate, which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C:**\n    *   Based on the retrosynthesis, reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nComparing this with the given options, we find that option A matches all three results.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the three reactions to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of the base sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, `[:CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. Its structure is `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center for the Michael addition.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    2.  This forms a new C-C bond between the malonate carbon and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    3.  The intermediate is an enolate, `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - [:CH-COOCH₃]⁻`.\n    4.  Protonation of this enolate at the α-carbon by the solvent (EtOH) yields the final product.\n*   **Product A Structure:** The resulting structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Product A Name:** To name this compound using the IUPAC nomenclature provided in the options, we can consider it as a substituted propane tricarboxylate. The main three-carbon chain is `C(from malonate) — C(β from acrylate) — C(α from acrylate)`.\n    *   Let's number this chain: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)-CH₂(3)`.\n    *   This gives a propane skeleton.\n    *   There are two methyl carboxylate (`-COOCH₃`) groups on C1 and one on C3. Thus, it's a propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n    *   There is a p-tolyl group on C2.\n    *   Therefore, the full name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   This reaction is a Stork enamine synthesis, which functions as a Michael addition.\n*   **Nucleophile:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 of the original cyclohexene ring).\n*   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), which has the structure `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The nucleophilic carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    2.  This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    3.  The addition of H₃O⁺ in the second step serves to hydrolyze the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n*   **Product B Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring where the α-carbon (C2) is substituted with the alkyl group from the but-2-enenitrile. The attacking carbon from the enamine is the one that becomes the α-carbon to the resulting ketone. The substituent is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n*   **Product B Name:** The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the compound is named as a derivative of butanenitrile. The carbon chain is `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`. A `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group is attached at position 3.\n    *   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is favored over the enol form after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   This is a retrosynthesis problem where we are given the product and one reactant and asked to find the other reactant (C).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Let's break down this structure.\n    *   The main structure is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   At position 2, there is a `-(3-oxobutyl)` substituent: `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). Its structure is `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`.\n*   **Analysis:** In a Michael addition, a C-C bond is formed between the nucleophile and the β-carbon of the acceptor. In our product, the `(3-oxobutyl)` group, `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, is derived from MVK after the double bond has been reduced by the addition reaction. The bond to the main ring is at the position of the former β-carbon. This is consistent with a Michael addition.\n*   **Reactant C (Michael Donor):** The rest of the molecule must have come from the Michael donor. This is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring, with the new bond formed at the C2 position. The proton at C2 of a 1,3-dione is highly acidic and is easily removed by a base (like KOH) to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Therefore, reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. Although it exists predominantly in its enol form (`3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one`), it is conventionally named and represented in reaction schemes as the diketone. Naming it as the diketone is also consistent with the naming of the product.\n\n### Summary:\n*   **Product A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **Product B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **Reactant C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination of answers matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
