Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the energy levels are quantized. The energy of the *n*-th level is given by:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Therefore, the energy of the *n*-th level can be expressed as:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\nSo, the first few single-particle energy levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n### 2. Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the pair of quantum numbers: the principal quantum number *n* and the spin projection quantum number *m_s* (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n\nThis implies that each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### 3. Calculating the System Energies\n\nThe total energy of the four-particle system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles. We need to find the three lowest possible total energies by distributing the four particles among the available single-particle states.\n\n#### Ground State (Lowest Energy)\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up:\n*   We place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, **n=1** (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1E) = 2E$.\n*   We place the next two particles in the second lowest energy level, **n=2** (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (4E) = 8E$.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n#### First Excited State (Next Lowest Energy)\n\nTo find the first excited state, we create the lowest-energy excitation from the ground state. This is done by moving one particle from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{first} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{first} = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n#### Second Excited State (Third Lowest Energy)\n\nTo find the second excited state, we need to find the configuration with the next lowest energy. We can consider other possible excitations from the ground state:\n*   **Possibility 1 (First Excited State):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration becomes: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration becomes: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states we have found so far (15E, 18E, 22E, ...), the lowest energy is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states of the system are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n**1. System and Energy Levels**\n\n*   **System:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy:** The energy for a single particle in such a well is given by the formula:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$ , where n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** For spin-1/2 particles, the spin quantum number can be $m_s = +1/2$ (spin-up) or $m_s = -1/2$ (spin-down). The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state (defined by both n and $m_s$). This means that for each energy level 'n', we can place at most two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**2. Ground State Energy Calculation**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy $E_1 = 1^2E = E$):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy $E_2 = 2^2E = 4E$):** We have two remaining particles, which we place in the next lowest level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state ($E_{gs}$) is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E)$\n$E_{gs} = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**3. First Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe first excited state is created by the lowest possible energy excitation from the ground state. This involves moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Excitation:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level (Energy $E_3 = 3^2E = 9E$).\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state ($E_{1st}$) is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E)$\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**4. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (from excitation n=2 → n=3).\n*   Let's consider other possible single-particle and multi-particle excitations from the ground state:\n    *   **Possibility A: Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n        *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Possibility B: Excite two particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   **Possibility C: Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nThe possible excited state energies are 15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, etc.\n*   The lowest energy is the first excited state: 15E.\n*   The next lowest energy is the second excited state: 18E.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the System\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are called fermions.\n*   **Identical Fermions and the Pauli Exclusion Principle:** According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum States:** For a particle in a 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be `+1/2` for spin-up or `-1/2` for spin-down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`\n    The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`.\n    So, the single-particle energy levels are `E_n = n^2 * E`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because of the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles (one with spin up and one with spin down) without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground)\n\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions.\n\n1.  **Level n=1:** We place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, `n=1`. One will be spin-up, the other spin-down.\n    *   Energy of these two particles = `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n2.  **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles in the next available energy level, `n=2`.\n    *   Energy of these two particles = `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E`.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the state with the lowest energy above the ground state. We can find this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2` and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n*   We move one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n*   The new configuration of particles is:\n    *   2 particles in `n=1` (Energy: `2 * E_1 = 2E`)\n    *   1 particle in `n=2` (Energy: `1 * E_2 = 4E`)\n    *   1 particle in `n=3` (Energy: `1 * E_3 = 1 * (3^2 * E) = 9E`)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n`E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to consider different possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\nLet's list the energies of a few possible low-energy configurations:\n\n*   **Ground State:** {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2} -> Energy = `(2*1 + 2*4)E = 10E`.\n*   **First Excited State:** {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3} -> Energy = `(2*1 + 1*4 + 1*9)E = 15E`.\n*   **Other Excitations:**\n    *   **Possibility A:** Excite one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n        *   Energy = `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1*1 + 2*4 + 1*9)E = (1 + 8 + 9)E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Excite both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3}.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2*1 + 2*9)E = (2 + 18)E = 20E`.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Excite one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The configuration becomes {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2*1 + 1*4 + 1*16)E = (2 + 4 + 16)E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the second lowest energy after the ground state is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is `E_2nd = 18E`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires us to determine the total energy of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well for its three lowest energy states.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n*   **Implication:** Because there are two possible spin states for each energy level `n`, each level can hold a maximum of two particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L is given by:\nE_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\nwhere `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2). So, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of E:\nE_n = n^2 * E\n\nLet's list the first few energy levels:\n*   n = 1: E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n*   n = 2: E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n*   n = 3: E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n*   n = 4: E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n\n**3. Calculating the Total Energies**\n\nWe need to place the four fermions into these energy levels to find the total energy for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.\n\n**A. Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest possible energy levels first.\n*   Place two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is 2 * E_1 = 2 * (1E) = 2E.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the next lowest level, `n=2`. Their combined energy is 2 * E_2 = 2 * (4E) = 8E.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n    E_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**B. First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for this configuration is:\n    E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n    E_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)\n    E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**C. Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider different possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\nLet's list the possibilities and their energies:\n*   **First Excited State (already found):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E.\n*   **Possibility 1:** Promote one particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest empty level, `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = (1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, two in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E,...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Ground State Energy = 10E\n*   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n*   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\n*   **Particles:** The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Identical fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by both the energy level (principal quantum number `n`) and the spin projection (`m_s`, which can be spin up or spin down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L are given by:\n    $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. So, the single-particle energy levels are $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because of spin, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_GS)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1:** Can hold 2 particles.

Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (2^2)E = 8E$.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n\n*   The ground state configuration is (2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2).\n*   The first excited state configuration is (2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3).\n\nThe total energy for this configuration is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times 1^2 E) + (1 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 3^2 E)$\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider the next possible low-energy excitation from the ground state.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (by promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3)\n\nLet's consider the next lowest-energy promotion. We can promote a particle from a lower level (n=1) or promote a particle to a higher level (n=4).\n\n*   **Option A: Promote from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: (1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3).\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1^2 E) + (2 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n\n*   **Option B: Promote from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   Configuration: (2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4).\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times 1^2 E) + (1 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 4^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of these possible excited states, the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.

Spin-1/2 particles are fermions, which means they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. They are confined to a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n\n2.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by the formula:\n    E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\n    where *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), *m* is the mass of the particle, and *L* is the length of the well.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit E as:\n    E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\n    So, we can express the single-particle energy levels simply as:\n    *   E_1 (n=1) = 1^2 * E = 1E\n    *   E_2 (n=2) = 2^2 * E = 4E\n    *   E_3 (n=3) = 3^2 * E = 9E\n    *   E_4 (n=4) = 4^2 * E = 16E\n    *   and so on.\n\n4.  **Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by the energy level *n* and the spin projection *m_s* (which can be spin up, +1/2, or spin down, -1/2).

Calculating the Total Energies\n\nNow we will fill these energy levels with the four fermions to find the total energy of the system for the ground state and the first two excited states.\n\n#### a) Ground State Energy (E_ground)\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **n = 1 level (Energy = 1E):** We can place 2 particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **n = 2 level (Energy = 4E):** We place the remaining 2 particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2)`\n`E_ground = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n#### b) First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   The ground state configuration is: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   Promote one particle: Move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n*   The new configuration is: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n`E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)`\n`E_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n#### c) Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider different possibilities for exciting the system from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\n*   **Possibility 1 (already found):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E. This is the first excited state.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n*   **Possibility 4:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### Summary\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1.

Particles with half-integer spin are called fermions.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are confined to a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are quantized and given by the formula:\n    E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)\n    where *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem conveniently defines a base energy unit E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2). Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n    E_n = n^2 * E\n    *   E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n    *   E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n    *   E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n    *   E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n    *   and so on.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Since the particles are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by all its quantum numbers. In this case, the quantum numbers are the principal quantum number *n* and the spin magnetic quantum number *m_s* (which can be +1/2 for \"spin up\" or -1/2 for \"spin down\"). This means that for any given energy level *n*, we can place at most two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### **2.

This is the first excited state.\n*   **Excitation 2:** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   New Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = (1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Excitation 3:** Move both particles from n=2 to n=3 (a two-particle excitation).\n    *   New Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Excitation 4:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   New Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Total Energy = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies for the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are classified as **fermions**.\n\n2.  **Key Principle for Fermions:** Identical fermions must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For particles in a potential well, a quantum state is defined by both its spatial quantum number (in this case, the energy level `n`) and its spin quantum number (`m_s`). Since the particles are spin-1/2, `m_s` can be either +1/2 (spin-up) or -1/2 (spin-down). Therefore, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n3.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** For a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the energy for a single particle in the `n`-th level is given by:\n    E_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n    The problem defines the base energy unit as E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²).\n    So, the single-particle energy levels can be written as:\n    *   E₁ = 1² * E = 1E\n    *   E₂ = 2² * E = 4E\n    *   E₃ = 3² * E = 9E\n    *   E₄ = 4² * E = 16E\n    *   and so on for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...\n\n4.  **Calculating the Total Energy of the System:** The total energy of the four-particle system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles.\n\n    *   **Ground State (Lowest Energy State):**\n        To find the ground state energy, we must fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n        -   Place the first two particles in the n=1 level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n        -   Place the remaining two particles in the next available level, n=2 (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n        -   The configuration is: two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n        -   The total ground state energy (E_gs) is:\n            E_gs = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n    *   **First Excited State:**\n        The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state.

This means that each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### 3. Calculating the System's Total Energy\n\nWe will now determine the total energy for the ground state and the first two excited states by filling the energy levels with the four particles according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n#### Ground State Energy ($E_{ground}$)\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels first.\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy = 1E):** We place the first two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).

For a spin-1/2 particle, $m_s$ can be +1/2 (spin-up) or -1/2 (spin-down).\n\nThis means that each spatial energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two fermions: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**3.

Understand the System and Energy Levels\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are identical and have half-integer spin, they are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This means no two particles can occupy the exact same quantum state. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level `n` and the spin projection `m_s` (spin-up or spin-down). Consequently, each energy level `n` can hold at most two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The single-particle energy eigenvalues are given by:\n    $E_n = \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}$, where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   **Energy Unit E:** The problem defines a unit of energy $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. We need to relate this to the standard energy formula.\n    Using $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$, we get $\\hbar^2 = \\frac{h^2}{4\\pi^2}$.\n    Substituting this into the definition of E:\n    $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 (\\frac{h^2}{4\\pi^2})}{2mL^2} = \\frac{h^2/4}{2mL^2} = \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$.\n    This is exactly the energy of the n=1 state.

Since they have half-integer spin, they are fermions.\n*   **Potential Well:** They are confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Key Principle:** Because the particles are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\n*   First, let's recall the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well. The energy for a given quantum number *n* (where n = 1, 2, 3, ...) is:\n    E_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)\n*   The problem defines a base energy unit E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2).\n*   So, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of E:\n    E_n = n^2 * E\n*   The first few energy levels are:\n    *   E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n    *   E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n    *   E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n    *   E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n    *   ...and so on.\n\n**3. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\n*   A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its energy level (*n*) and its spin state (spin up, m_s = +1/2, or spin down, m_s = -1/2).\n*   The Pauli Exclusion Principle means that each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**4.

Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\n*   To get the first excited state, we must move one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available higher energy level. This corresponds to the lowest possible energy increase.\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   **Excitation:** The smallest energy jump is to promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:**\n    *   Level n=1: 2 particles\n    *   Level n=2: 1 particle\n    *   Level n=3: 1 particle\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n    E_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\n\n**6. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\n*   The second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state and find the one with the second-smallest energy increase.\n*   **From Ground State (Total Energy = 10E):**\n    *   **Promotion 1 (First Excitation):** Move a particle from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Energy Increase: E_3 - E_2 = 9E - 4E = 5E.\n        *   Total Energy: 10E + 5E = 15E.\n    *   **Promotion 2 (Second Excitation):** Move a particle from n=1 to n=3.\n        *   Energy Increase: E_3 - E_1 = 9E - 1E = 8E.\n        *   Total Energy: 10E + 8E = 18E.\n    *   **Other promotions** would have higher energy costs (e.g., n=2 to n=4 has an increase of E_4 - E_2 = 16E - 4E = 12E).\n*   The lowest energy excitation gives the first excited state (15E). The second-lowest energy excitation gives the second excited state (18E).\n*   **Second Excited State Configuration:**\n    *   Level n=1: 1 particle\n    *   Level n=2: 2 particles\n    *   Level n=3: 1 particle\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:**\n    E_2nd = (1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n    E_2nd = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThis problem requires understanding the behavior of fermions in a quantum system, specifically within a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### **1.

Understanding the Fundamentals\n\n*   **System**: We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: A key property of fermions is that they obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For a particle in a 1D well, a quantum state is defined by its energy level (principal quantum number `n`) and its spin (up, `m_s = +1/2`, or down, `m_s = -1/2`). This means each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Levels**: For a single particle of mass `m` in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length `L`, the allowed energy levels are given by:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)` for `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n*   **Given Energy Unit**: The problem provides the base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`. Therefore, we can simplify the energy levels to:\n    *   `E_n = n^2 * E`\n    *   `E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`\n    *   `E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n    *   `E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n    *   `E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n    *   and so on.\n\n### 2.

This is typically achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration**: 2 particles in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=2`.\n*   **Excitation**: Move one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n*   **New Configuration**: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy**:\n    *   `E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)`\n    *   `E_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)`\n    *   `E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider different possible excitations from the ground state.\n\n*   **Possibility 1**: We already found the first excited state by promoting a particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. (Energy = 15E).\n*   **Possibility 2**: Promote a particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest available level, `n=3`.\n    *   **New Configuration**: 1 particle in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`.\n    *   **Energy**: `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Possibility 3**: Promote a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   **New Configuration**: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=4`.\n    *   **Energy**: `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n*   **Possibility 4**: Excite two particles, e.g., both from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   **New Configuration**: 2 particles in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=3`.\n    *   **Energy**: `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E), the second lowest is 18E.\n\n*   `E_2nd = 18E`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are:\n*   **Ground State**: 10E\n*   **First Excited State**: 15E\n*   **Second Excited State**: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThis problem involves determining the energy levels for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### **1. Understand the System**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a 1D infinite potential well of length L. The single-particle energy levels for this potential are given by:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$  where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a unit of energy $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. So, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   **Quantum State:** For a particle in this system, the complete quantum state is defined by its principal quantum number `n` (which determines its energy level) and its spin projection quantum number $m_s$ (which can be +1/2 for \"spin-up\" or -1/2 for \"spin-down\").\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because of the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two fermions: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### **2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nLet's list the energies of the lowest few single-particle states in terms of E:\n*   n = 1: $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   n = 2: $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   n = 3: $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   n = 4: $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n### **3. Calculation of System Energies**\n\nTo find the total energy of the system, we sum the energies of all four particles.\n\n**a) Ground State Energy (Lowest Total Energy)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle, until all four particles are placed.\n*   **Energy Level n=1:** This is the lowest energy level ($1E$). We can place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Energy Level n=2:** This is the next lowest level ($4E$). We place the remaining two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total ground state energy ($E_{ground}$) is the sum of the energies of the occupied states:\n$E_{ground}$ = (2 particles in n=1) + (2 particles in n=2)\n$E_{ground}$ = (2 * $E_1$) + (2 * $E_2$)\n$E_{ground}$ = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**b) First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   Ground state configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   The highest occupied level is n=2. The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We promote one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n*   New configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state ($E_{1st}$) is:\n$E_{1st}$ = (2 * $E_1$) + (1 * $E_2$) + (1 * $E_3$)\n$E_{1st}$ = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**c) Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider all possible promotions from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\nLet's analyze the energy increase ($\\Delta E$) for different single-particle promotions from the ground state configuration (2 in n=1, 2 in n=2):\n\n1.  **Promote 1 particle from n=2 to n=3:**  $\\Delta E = E_3 - E_2 = 9E - 4E = 5E$.\n    Total Energy = 10E + 5E = 15E. (This is the 1st excited state).\n2.  **Promote 1 particle from n=1 to n=3:** $\\Delta E = E_3 - E_1 = 9E - 1E = 8E$.\n    Total Energy = 10E + 8E = **18E**. (Configuration: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3).\n3.  **Promote 2 particles from n=2 to n=3:** $\\Delta E = 2(E_3 - E_2) = 2(5E) = 10E$.\n    Total Energy = 10E + 10E = 20E. (Configuration: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3).\n4.  **Promote 1 particle from n=2 to n=4:** $\\Delta E = E_4 - E_2 = 16E - 4E = 12E$.\n    Total Energy = 10E + 12E = 22E. (Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4).\n\nComparing the total energies of these excited configurations (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (first excited state) and the second lowest is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state energy ($E_{2nd}$) is **18E**.\n\n### **4.

Let's move a particle from n=1 to the lowest empty level, n=3.\n        *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n        *   Energy = [1 × (1²E)] + [2 × (2²E)] + [1 × (3²E)] = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3.\n        *   Energy = [2 × (1²E)] + [2 × (3²E)] = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4 (a higher level).\n        *   Configuration: Two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n        *   Energy = [2 × (1²E)] + [1 × (2²E)] + [1 × (4²E)] = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\nComparing the energies of the possible excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state) and the next lowest is 18E.\n\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** E_2nd = 18E.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies for the three states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThis problem involves determining the energy levels of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Since spin-1/2 particles are fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n### **1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by the formula:\n`E_n = n^2 * (ħ^2 * π^2) / (2mL^2)`\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   `m` is the mass of the particle.\n*   `L` is the length of the well.\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit `E = (ħ^2 * π^2) / (2mL^2)`.\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n`E_n = n^2 * E`\n\n*   `E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`\n*   `E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n*   `E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n*   `E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n*   and so on.\n\n### **2.

A particle's state is defined by its principal quantum number `n` and its spin quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down). The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. This means that for each energy level `n`, we can have at most two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### **3. Ground State Energy (E_g)**\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we must place the four particles into the lowest possible energy levels without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy = 1E):** We can place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_g = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2)`\n`E_g = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n### **4. First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state corresponds to the lowest possible energy greater than the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   Ground state configuration: Two particles in n=1, two in n=2.\n*   Highest Occupied Level: n=2.\n*   Lowest Unoccupied Level: n=3.\n\nWe move one particle from n=2 to n=3.

Understanding the System\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by its full set of quantum numbers.\n*   **Quantum States in a 1D Infinite Well:** For a particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L, the quantum states are defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (`n = 1, 2, 3, ...`), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin up, ↑) or `-1/2` (spin down, ↓).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy of a single particle in the state `n` is given by:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`\n    The problem conveniently defines the base energy unit as `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`.\n    So, the energy of a particle in level `n` is `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n*   **State Occupancy:** Due to the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two fermions.\n\n### 2. Calculating the State Energies\n\nWe need to place the four fermions into the available energy levels to find the configurations corresponding to the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles.\n\n#### Ground State Energy\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest energy levels first, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Level n=1:** We can place two fermions here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy = `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n*   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two fermions here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy = `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E`.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of these energies:\n`E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n#### First Excited State Energy\n\nTo find the first excited state, we must create the lowest possible energy excitation from the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2` and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n*   We promote one fermion from `n=2` to `n=3`. The new configuration is:\n    *   **Level n=1:** 2 fermions. Energy = `2 * E_1 = 2E`.\n    *   **Level n=2:** 1 fermion. Energy = `1 * E_2 = 1 * (2^2 * E) = 4E`.\n    *   **Level n=3:** 1 fermion. Energy = `1 * E_3 = 1 * (3^2 * E) = 9E`.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n`E_first_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n#### Second Excited State Energy\n\nTo find the second excited state, we need to find the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. Let's consider the possible excitations from the ground state:\n*   **Configuration A (First Excited State):** Promote one fermion from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: {2 fermions in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = `(2 * 1^2 + 1 * 2^2 + 1 * 3^2)E = (2 + 4 + 9)E = 15E`.\n*   **Configuration B:** Promote one fermion from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: {1 fermion in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = `(1 * 1^2 + 2 * 2^2 + 1 * 3^2)E = (1 + 8 + 9)E = 18E`.\n*   **Configuration C:** Promote both fermions from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: {2 fermions in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = `(2 * 1^2 + 2 * 3^2)E = (2 + 18)E = 20E`.\n*   **Configuration D:** Promote one fermion from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: {2 fermions in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}\n    *   Energy = `(2 * 1^2 + 1 * 2^2 + 1 * 4^2)E = (2 + 4 + 16)E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited configurations:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First lowest excitation: 15E\n*   Second lowest excitation: 18E\n\nSo, the second excited state has an energy of `18E`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Being spin-1/2 particles (like electrons), they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. They are confined within a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n\n2.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are quantized and given by the formula:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    where n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n    The problem defines a base unit of energy $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n    *   and so on...\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Since the particles are fermions, no two particles can occupy the exact same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by both the energy level (n) and the spin state (spin up, $m_s = +1/2$, or spin down, $m_s = -1/2$). This means that each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n4.  **Calculate Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    To find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   The lowest energy level is n=1. We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times E = 2E$.\n    *   We have two particles left. The next lowest energy level is n=2. We can place the remaining two particles here (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n    *   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n        $E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n5.  **Calculate First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    The first excited state is the lowest-energy configuration possible that is not the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   Ground state configuration: (2 particles in n=1), (2 particles in n=2).\n    *   Highest occupied level: n=2.\n    *   Lowest unoccupied level: n=3.\n    *   We promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   New configuration: (2 particles in n=1), (1 particle in n=2), (1 particle in n=3).\n    *   Calculate the total energy for this configuration:\n        $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n6.  **Calculate Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    The second excited state is the next-lowest energy configuration. We must consider different ways to excite the system from the ground state.\n    *   **Possibility A (from First Excited State):** Promote the remaining particle from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: (2 particles in n=1), (0 in n=2), (2 in n=3).\n        *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 2 \\times (9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   **Possibility B (from Ground State):** Promote a particle from a lower level (n=1) to the lowest empty level (n=3).\n        *   Configuration: (1 particle in n=1), (2 particles in n=2), (1 particle in n=3).\n        *   Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Possibility C (from Ground State):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4 (a higher jump).\n        *   Configuration: (2 particles in n=1), (1 particle in n=2), (1 particle in n=4).\n        *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n    *   Comparing the possible energies for the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the second lowest energy after the ground state (10E) is 18E. Thus, $E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis matches option C. The python code execution also confirmed these values.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nThis problem requires us to determine the energies of the three lowest states (ground state, first excited state, and second excited state) for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### 1. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFirst, let's establish the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L. The energy of the n-th level is given by:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere *n* = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nSo, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\nThe first few energy levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n### 2. The Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are described as \"identical spin-1/2 particles,\" which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this system is defined by its principal quantum number (n) and its spin magnetic quantum number ($m_s$). For a spin-1/2 particle, $m_s$ can be either +1/2 (spin up) or -1/2 (spin down).\n\nThis means that each spatial energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Total Energies of the System\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles. We need to find the configurations of the four particles that result in the three lowest possible total energies.\n\n#### a) Ground State Energy ($E_{GS}$)\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels starting from the lowest one, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle, until all four particles are placed.\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy 1E):** We can place 2 particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy 4E):** We place the remaining 2 particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nTotal Ground State Energy = (Energy of 2 particles in n=1) + (Energy of 2 particles in n=2)\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n#### b) First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the next available unoccupied level.\n*   The ground state configuration has particles in n=1 and n=2.\n*   The highest occupied level is n=2. The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, and 1 particle in n=3.\n\nTotal First Excited State Energy = (Energy of 2 particles in n=1) + (Energy of 1 particle in n=2) + (Energy of 1 particle in n=3)\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n#### c) Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy. We need to consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state and identify the one with the second-lowest excitation energy.\n\nLet's compare the energies of the next possible configurations:\n*   **Configuration 1 (First Excited State, calculated above):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Occupation: {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = 15E\n\n*   **Configuration 2:** Move one particle from a lower level, n=1, to the next available level, n=3.\n    *   Occupation: {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$\n\n*   **Configuration 3:** Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Occupation: {2 in n=1, 2 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state) and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### Summary\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1.

Being spin-1/2 means they are **fermions**. \"Identical\" means they are indistinguishable.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Because the particles are fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state for a particle in this system is defined by its spatial quantum number `n` and its spin quantum number `ms` (+1/2 or -1/2).

We create this by moving one particle from an occupied level to the lowest available unoccupied level.\n1.  **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n2.  **Lowest Excitation:** The smallest energy jump involves moving a particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n3.  **New Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n4.  **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    E_first = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\n    E_first = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E)\n    E_first = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n#### c) Second Excited State Energy (E_second)\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to find the next possible energy jump from the ground state.\nLet's consider the possible excitations from the ground state configuration and find their energies:\n*   **Excitation 1 (First Excited State):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3.

Single-Particle Energy Levels\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by the formula:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nThe problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on...\n\nEach energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two fermions: one with spin-up and one with spin-down, because the states `(n, +1/2)` and `(n, -1/2)` are distinct.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_g)\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy for the system of four particles. To achieve this, we fill the lowest available single-particle energy levels according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1:** This is the lowest energy level (E₁ = E). We can place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   Energy contribution = 2 * E₁ = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** This is the next lowest energy level (E₂ = 4E). We place the remaining two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   Energy contribution = 2 * E₂ = 2 * (4E) = 8E.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n$E_g = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n### 4.

Since `ħ = h / 2π`, we can rewrite `E_n` in terms of `E`:\n`E_n = n^2 * (π²ħ² / 2mL²) = n^2 * E`\n\nSo, the individual energy levels are:\n*   `n=1`: E₁ = 1²E = 1E\n*   `n=2`: E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n*   `n=3`: E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n*   `n=4`: E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n*   and so on...\n\n### **2. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Since each particle can have one of two spin states (spin-up or spin-down), each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles.\n\n### **3.

We can achieve this by considering other single-particle promotions from the ground state. The next lowest-energy promotion involves moving a particle from a lower level (`n=1`) to the lowest empty level (`n=3`).\n*   The ground state configuration is: (2 particles in n=1), (2 particles in n=2).\n*   Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n*   The new configuration is: 1 particle in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=2`, and 1 particle in `n=3`.\n\nTotal Second Excited State Energy = `(1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃)`\n= `(1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)`\n= `1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`\n\n*(Note: Another possible excitation from the ground state would be moving a particle from n=2 to n=4, which would result in an energy of 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. Since 18E < 22E, 18E is the energy of the second excited state.)*\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Ground State Energy = **10E**\n*   First Excited State Energy = **15E**\n*   Second Excited State Energy = **18E**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The problem describes a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles confined within a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.

This means they are **fermions**. Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n\n    The state of a particle in this well is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number 'n' (which determines the spatial part of the wavefunction and the energy) and the spin magnetic quantum number 'm_s'. For a spin-1/2 particle, 'm_s' can be +1/2 (spin up, ↑) or -1/2 (spin down, ↓).\n\n    Therefore, for each energy level E_n (defined by 'n'), there are two distinct quantum states: one with spin up and one with spin down.

A quantum state here is defined by the principal quantum number (n) and the spin projection quantum number ($m_s$, which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down). This implies that each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy ($E_{gs}$)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **n=1 level:** We can place two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 * $E_1$ = 2 * E = 2E.\n*   **n=2 level:** We have two remaining particles. We can place them in the next lowest level, n=2 (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 * $E_2$ = 2 * (4E) = 8E.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{gs}$ = (Energy from n=1) + (Energy from n=2) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**4.

Let's consider other possibilities:\n\n*   **Possibility A: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   This is the next lowest single-particle excitation. The ground state has particles in n=1 and n=2. Promoting from n=2 to n=3 gives the 1st excited state. Promoting from n=1 to n=3 must result in a different, higher energy state.\n    *   **New Configuration:** One particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   **Energy:** $E_A$ = (1 * $E_1$) + (2 * $E_2$) + (1 * $E_3$) = (1 * E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\n*   **Possibility B: Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n    *   **New Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n    *   **Energy:** $E_B$ = (2 * $E_1$) + (2 * $E_3$) = (2 * E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\n*   **Possibility C: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   **New Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, one particle in n=4.\n    *   **Energy:** $E_C$ = (2 * $E_1$) + (1 * $E_2$) + (1 * $E_4$) = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the second lowest energy after the ground state (10E) is 18E.\n\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThe energies are 10E, 15E, and 18E.

Understand the System and Fundamental Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. This means they are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum State:** In this system, a particle's quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number *n* (or energy level), where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n    2.

Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the state with the next lowest total energy after the ground state. We create this by promoting a particle with the smallest possible energy increase. This typically involves moving a particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   **Highest Occupied Level:** n=2.\n*   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** n=3.\n*   **Promotion:** We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **New Configuration:**\n    *   Level n=1: 2 particles → Energy = 2 × $E_1$ = 2E\n    *   Level n=2: 1 particle → Energy = 1 × $E_2$ = 4E\n    *   Level n=3: 1 particle → Energy = 1 × $E_3$ = 9E\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    *   $E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n### **4.

Understand the Basics**\n\n*   **Particles:** The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Being fermions, these particles must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by both its energy level (principal quantum number `n`) and its spin projection (`m_s`).\n*   **Spin States:** For a spin-1/2 particle, there are two possible spin states: spin up (`m_s` = +1/2) and spin down (`m_s` = -1/2).\n*   **Implication of Pauli Principle:** Due to the two spin states, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a single particle of mass `m` in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length `L`, the allowed energy levels are given by:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere `n = 1, 2, 3, ...` is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem defines a base unit of energy `E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}`. So, we can express the single-particle energy levels simply as:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n**3. Calculating the Total Energies**\n\nWe need to place the four fermions into these energy levels to find the total energy of the system for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.\n\n*   **Ground State (Lowest Total Energy)**\n    To achieve the lowest possible total energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n    *   We place the first two particles into the `n=1` level (one spin up, one spin down). The energy contributed is `2 * E_1 = 2 * E = 2E`.\n    *   We place the next two particles into the `n=2` level (one spin up, one spin down). The energy contributed is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (4E) = 8E`.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n        $E_{ground} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n*   **First Excited State (Next Lowest Total Energy)**\n    To get the first excited state, we must promote one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available higher energy level in the least \"expensive\" way (i.e., the smallest energy jump). The ground state configuration has the `n=1` and `n=2` levels filled. The lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`. The cheapest excitation is to move a particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n    *   The new configuration is: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, and 1 particle in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy for this configuration is:\n        $E_{1st\\_excited} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n        $E_{1st\\_excited} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n*   **Second Excited State (Third Lowest Total Energy)**\n    We need to find the configuration with the next lowest energy. Let's consider the possible excitations from the ground state that result in a higher energy than the first excited state (15E).\n    *   **Possibility 1:** Excite a particle from `n=1` (instead of `n=2`) to the lowest empty level `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: 1 particle in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = E + 2(4E) + 9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Possibility 2:** Excite two particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 0 particles in `n=2`, 2 particles in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   **Possibility 3:** Excite one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=4`.\n        *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\n    Comparing the energies of these excited states (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest one after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n    *   $E_{2nd\\_excited} = 18E$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **1.

    "**Detailed Reasoning Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:**\n    *   The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. These are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The energy levels for a single particle are quantized: $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    *   The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, so the single-particle energy levels are simply $E_n = n^2 E$.\n    *   The Pauli Exclusion Principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.

Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the energy levels are quantized. The energy of the *n*-th level is given by:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Therefore, the energy of the *n*-th level can be expressed as:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\nSo, the first few single-particle energy levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n### 2. Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the pair of quantum numbers: the principal quantum number *n* and the spin projection quantum number *m_s* (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n\nThis implies that each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### 3. Calculating the System Energies\n\nThe total energy of the four-particle system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles. We need to find the three lowest possible total energies by distributing the four particles among the available single-particle states.\n\n#### Ground State (Lowest Energy)\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up:\n*   We place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, **n=1** (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1E) = 2E$.\n*   We place the next two particles in the second lowest energy level, **n=2** (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (4E) = 8E$.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n#### First Excited State (Next Lowest Energy)\n\nTo find the first excited state, we create the lowest-energy excitation from the ground state. This is done by moving one particle from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{first} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{first} = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n#### Second Excited State (Third Lowest Energy)\n\nTo find the second excited state, we need to find the configuration with the next lowest energy. We can consider other possible excitations from the ground state:\n*   **Possibility 1 (First Excited State):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration becomes: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration becomes: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states we have found so far (15E, 18E, 22E, ...), the lowest energy is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states of the system are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n**1. System and Energy Levels**\n\n*   **System:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy:** The energy for a single particle in such a well is given by the formula:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$ , where n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** For spin-1/2 particles, the spin quantum number can be $m_s = +1/2$ (spin-up) or $m_s = -1/2$ (spin-down). The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state (defined by both n and $m_s$). This means that for each energy level 'n', we can place at most two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**2. Ground State Energy Calculation**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy $E_1 = 1^2E = E$):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy $E_2 = 2^2E = 4E$):** We have two remaining particles, which we place in the next lowest level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state ($E_{gs}$) is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E)$\n$E_{gs} = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**3. First Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe first excited state is created by the lowest possible energy excitation from the ground state. This involves moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Excitation:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level (Energy $E_3 = 3^2E = 9E$).\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state ($E_{1st}$) is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E)$\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**4. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (from excitation n=2 → n=3).\n*   Let's consider other possible single-particle and multi-particle excitations from the ground state:\n    *   **Possibility A: Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n        *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Possibility B: Excite two particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   **Possibility C: Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nThe possible excited state energies are 15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, etc.\n*   The lowest energy is the first excited state: 15E.\n*   The next lowest energy is the second excited state: 18E.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the System\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are called fermions.\n*   **Identical Fermions and the Pauli Exclusion Principle:** According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum States:** For a particle in a 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be `+1/2` for spin-up or `-1/2` for spin-down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`\n    The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`.\n    So, the single-particle energy levels are `E_n = n^2 * E`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because of the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles (one with spin up and one with spin down) without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground)\n\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions.\n\n1.  **Level n=1:** We place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, `n=1`. One will be spin-up, the other spin-down.\n    *   Energy of these two particles = `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n2.  **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles in the next available energy level, `n=2`.\n    *   Energy of these two particles = `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E`.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the state with the lowest energy above the ground state. We can find this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2` and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n*   We move one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n*   The new configuration of particles is:\n    *   2 particles in `n=1` (Energy: `2 * E_1 = 2E`)\n    *   1 particle in `n=2` (Energy: `1 * E_2 = 4E`)\n    *   1 particle in `n=3` (Energy: `1 * E_3 = 1 * (3^2 * E) = 9E`)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n`E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to consider different possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\nLet's list the energies of a few possible low-energy configurations:\n\n*   **Ground State:** {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2} -> Energy = `(2*1 + 2*4)E = 10E`.\n*   **First Excited State:** {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3} -> Energy = `(2*1 + 1*4 + 1*9)E = 15E`.\n*   **Other Excitations:**\n    *   **Possibility A:** Excite one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.

The configuration becomes {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3}.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2*1 + 2*9)E = (2 + 18)E = 20E`.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Excite one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The configuration becomes {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2*1 + 1*4 + 1*16)E = (2 + 4 + 16)E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the second lowest energy after the ground state is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is `E_2nd = 18E`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires us to determine the total energy of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well for its three lowest energy states.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n*   **Implication:** Because there are two possible spin states for each energy level `n`, each level can hold a maximum of two particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L is given by:\nE_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\nwhere `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2). So, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of E:\nE_n = n^2 * E\n\nLet's list the first few energy levels:\n*   n = 1: E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n*   n = 2: E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n*   n = 3: E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n*   n = 4: E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n\n**3. Calculating the Total Energies**\n\nWe need to place the four fermions into these energy levels to find the total energy for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.\n\n**A. Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest possible energy levels first.\n*   Place two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is 2 * E_1 = 2 * (1E) = 2E.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the next lowest level, `n=2`. Their combined energy is 2 * E_2 = 2 * (4E) = 8E.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n    E_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**B. First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for this configuration is:\n    E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n    E_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)\n    E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**C.

We need to consider different ways to excite the system from the ground state and find which one has the second-lowest energy increase.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (from promoting n=2 → n=3)\n\nLet's consider other possible excitations from the ground state:\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\n*   **Possibility B:** Excite two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\n*   **Possibility C:** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of the possible excited states: 15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...\nThe lowest energy is the ground state (10E).\nThe next lowest is the first excited state (15E).\nThe third lowest is the second excited state, which is 18E.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe energies of the three states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the System and Energy Levels\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are identical and have half-integer spin, they are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This means no two particles can occupy the exact same quantum state. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level `n` and the spin projection `m_s` (spin-up or spin-down). Consequently, each energy level `n` can hold at most two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The single-particle energy eigenvalues are given by:\n    $E_n = \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}$, where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   **Energy Unit E:** The problem defines a unit of energy $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. We need to relate this to the standard energy formula.\n    Using $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$, we get $\\hbar^2 = \\frac{h^2}{4\\pi^2}$.\n    Substituting this into the definition of E:\n    $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 (\\frac{h^2}{4\\pi^2})}{2mL^2} = \\frac{h^2/4}{2mL^2} = \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$.\n    This is exactly the energy of the n=1 state. So, the single-particle energy levels can be conveniently written as:\n    $E_n = n^2 E$.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_gs)\n\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **n = 1 level:** Can hold two particles. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E$.\n*   **n = 2 level:** We still need to place two more particles. They go into the next lowest level, n=2. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (2^2 E) = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n\nAll four particles are now placed. The total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all particles:\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n### 3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy. We can find this by promoting one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available energy level, requiring the minimum amount of energy.\n\n*   **Ground state configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Lowest energy excitation:** Promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **New configuration:**\n    *   **n = 1 level:** Two particles. Energy = $2 \\times E_1 = 2E$.\n    *   **n = 2 level:** One particle. Energy = $1 \\times E_2 = 1 \\times (2^2 E) = 4E$.\n    *   **n = 3 level:** One particle. Energy = $1 \\times E_3 = 1 \\times (3^2 E) = 9E$.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state has the third-lowest total energy. We need to find the next possible excitation from the ground state that has the lowest energy after the first excited state. Let's consider the possibilities:\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + (4^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 2 \\times (3^2 E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 2 \\times (2^2 E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (22E, 20E, 18E) with the first excited state (15E), the next lowest energy is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is:\n$E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1.

Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\n*   First, let's recall the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well. The energy for a given quantum number *n* (where n = 1, 2, 3, ...) is:\n    E_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)\n*   The problem defines a base energy unit E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2).\n*   So, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of E:\n    E_n = n^2 * E\n*   The first few energy levels are:\n    *   E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n    *   E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n    *   E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n    *   E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n    *   ...and so on.\n\n**3. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\n*   A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its energy level (*n*) and its spin state (spin up, m_s = +1/2, or spin down, m_s = -1/2).\n*   The Pauli Exclusion Principle means that each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**4. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\n*   To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy E_1 = 1E):** We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy E_2 = 4E):** We have two particles left, so we place them in the next lowest level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:**\n    E_ground = (2 particles * E_1) + (2 particles * E_2)\n    E_ground = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E\n\n**5. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\n*   To get the first excited state, we must move one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available higher energy level. This corresponds to the lowest possible energy increase.\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   **Excitation:** The smallest energy jump is to promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:**\n    *   Level n=1: 2 particles\n    *   Level n=2: 1 particle\n    *   Level n=3: 1 particle\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n    E_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\n\n**6. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\n*   The second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state and find the one with the second-smallest energy increase.\n*   **From Ground State (Total Energy = 10E):**\n    *   **Promotion 1 (First Excitation):** Move a particle from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Energy Increase: E_3 - E_2 = 9E - 4E = 5E.\n        *   Total Energy: 10E + 5E = 15E.\n    *   **Promotion 2 (Second Excitation):** Move a particle from n=1 to n=3.\n        *   Energy Increase: E_3 - E_1 = 9E - 1E = 8E.\n        *   Total Energy: 10E + 8E = 18E.\n    *   **Other promotions** would have higher energy costs (e.g., n=2 to n=4 has an increase of E_4 - E_2 = 16E - 4E = 12E).\n*   The lowest energy excitation gives the first excited state (15E). The second-lowest energy excitation gives the second excited state (18E).\n*   **Second Excited State Configuration:**\n    *   Level n=1: 1 particle\n    *   Level n=2: 2 particles\n    *   Level n=3: 1 particle\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:**\n    E_2nd = (1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n    E_2nd = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThis problem requires understanding the behavior of fermions in a quantum system, specifically within a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### **1.

Understanding the Fundamentals\n\n*   **System**: We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: A key property of fermions is that they obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For a particle in a 1D well, a quantum state is defined by its energy level (principal quantum number `n`) and its spin (up, `m_s = +1/2`, or down, `m_s = -1/2`). This means each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Levels**: For a single particle of mass `m` in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length `L`, the allowed energy levels are given by:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)` for `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n*   **Given Energy Unit**: The problem provides the base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`.

So, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   **Quantum State:** For a particle in this system, the complete quantum state is defined by its principal quantum number `n` (which determines its energy level) and its spin projection quantum number $m_s$ (which can be +1/2 for \"spin-up\" or -1/2 for \"spin-down\").\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because of the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two fermions: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### **2.

Understanding the System\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by its full set of quantum numbers.\n*   **Quantum States in a 1D Infinite Well:** For a particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L, the quantum states are defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (`n = 1, 2, 3, ...`), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin up, ↑) or `-1/2` (spin down, ↓).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy of a single particle in the state `n` is given by:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`\n    The problem conveniently defines the base energy unit as `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`.\n    So, the energy of a particle in level `n` is `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n*   **State Occupancy:** Due to the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two fermions.\n\n### 2.

The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles.\n\n#### Ground State Energy\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest energy levels first, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Level n=1:** We can place two fermions here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy = `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n*   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two fermions here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy = `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E`.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of these energies:\n`E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n#### First Excited State Energy\n\nTo find the first excited state, we must create the lowest possible energy excitation from the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2` and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n*   We promote one fermion from `n=2` to `n=3`. The new configuration is:\n    *   **Level n=1:** 2 fermions. Energy = `2 * E_1 = 2E`.\n    *   **Level n=2:** 1 fermion. Energy = `1 * E_2 = 1 * (2^2 * E) = 4E`.\n    *   **Level n=3:** 1 fermion.

Let's consider the possible excitations from the ground state:\n*   **Configuration A (First Excited State):** Promote one fermion from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: {2 fermions in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = `(2 * 1^2 + 1 * 2^2 + 1 * 3^2)E = (2 + 4 + 9)E = 15E`.\n*   **Configuration B:** Promote one fermion from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: {1 fermion in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = `(1 * 1^2 + 2 * 2^2 + 1 * 3^2)E = (1 + 8 + 9)E = 18E`.\n*   **Configuration C:** Promote both fermions from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: {2 fermions in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = `(2 * 1^2 + 2 * 3^2)E = (2 + 18)E = 20E`.\n*   **Configuration D:** Promote one fermion from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: {2 fermions in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}\n    *   Energy = `(2 * 1^2 + 1 * 2^2 + 1 * 4^2)E = (2 + 4 + 16)E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited configurations:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First lowest excitation: 15E\n*   Second lowest excitation: 18E\n\nSo, the second excited state has an energy of `18E`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles.

Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFirst, let's establish the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L. The energy of the n-th level is given by:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere *n* = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nSo, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\nThe first few energy levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n### 2.

This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the next available unoccupied level.\n*   The ground state configuration has particles in n=1 and n=2.\n*   The highest occupied level is n=2. The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, and 1 particle in n=3.\n\nTotal First Excited State Energy = (Energy of 2 particles in n=1) + (Energy of 1 particle in n=2) + (Energy of 1 particle in n=3)\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n#### c) Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy. We need to consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state and identify the one with the second-lowest excitation energy.\n\nLet's compare the energies of the next possible configurations:\n*   **Configuration 1 (First Excited State, calculated above):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Occupation: {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = 15E\n\n*   **Configuration 2:** Move one particle from a lower level, n=1, to the next available level, n=3.\n    *   Occupation: {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$\n\n*   **Configuration 3:** Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Occupation: {2 in n=1, 2 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state) and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### Summary\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1.

This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state for a particle in this system is defined by its spatial quantum number `n` and its spin quantum number `ms` (+1/2 or -1/2).

Particles with half-integer spin are called fermions. A key property of identical fermions is that they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\n2.  **Define Single-Particle States:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The allowed energy levels for a single particle in this potential are given by the formula:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\n    The problem provides the energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. So, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n    $E_n = n^2 E$\n\n    For each energy level `n`, a spin-1/2 particle can have two possible spin orientations: spin up ($m_s = +1/2$) or spin down ($m_s = -1/2$). Therefore, a complete single-particle quantum state is defined by the pair of quantum numbers (n, $m_s$). According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** fermions (one with spin up and one with spin down).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    The ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy for the system. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n    *   Place the first two fermions into the lowest energy level, n=1. They will have opposite spins. The energy contribution is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E$.\n    *   Place the next two fermions into the second lowest energy level, n=2. They will also have opposite spins. The energy contribution is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (2^2 E) = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n\n    The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n    $E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited):**\n    The first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest possible total energy. To get this state from the ground state, we need to promote a particle with the smallest possible energy jump. This is achieved by moving a particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n    *   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n    *   We promote one fermion from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   The new configuration of the system is:\n        *   Two particles in n=1 (Energy: $2 \\times E_1 = 2E$)\n        *   One particle in n=2 (Energy: $1 \\times E_2 = 4E$)\n        *   One particle in n=3 (Energy: $1 \\times E_3 = 1 \\times (3^2 E) = 9E$)\n\n    The total energy of the first excited state is:\n    $E_{1st\\_excited} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited):**\n    The second excited state is the configuration with the third lowest total energy. We need to find the next possible energy value above the first excited state (15E). Let's examine the possible low-energy configurations:\n\n    *   **Ground State Configuration:** (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2). Energy = 10E.\n    *   **First Excited State Configuration:** (2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3). Energy = 15E.\n\n    Now, let's look for other excitations from the ground state:\n    *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration becomes (1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3).\n        *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration becomes (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3).\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\n    Comparing the energies we have found: 10E (ground), 15E (1st excited), and 18E. The energy 18E is the next lowest value after 15E.\n    Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe energies of the three lowest states of the system are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The problem describes four identical spin-1/2 particles.

Being identical, they are indistinguishable. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are fermions.\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by the energy level quantum number `n` and the spin quantum number `m_s`.\n    *   **Potential:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n    *   **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in the n-th level of a 1D infinite well is given by `E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`.\n    *   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`.

This means they are **fermions**. Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n\n    The state of a particle in this well is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number 'n' (which determines the spatial part of the wavefunction and the energy) and the spin magnetic quantum number 'm_s'. For a spin-1/2 particle, 'm_s' can be +1/2 (spin up, ↑) or -1/2 (spin down, ↓).\n\n    Therefore, for each energy level E_n (defined by 'n'), there are two distinct quantum states: one with spin up and one with spin down.

A quantum state here is defined by the principal quantum number (n) and the spin projection quantum number ($m_s$, which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down). This implies that each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy ($E_{gs}$)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **n=1 level:** We can place two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 * $E_1$ = 2 * E = 2E.\n*   **n=2 level:** We have two remaining particles. We can place them in the next lowest level, n=2 (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 * $E_2$ = 2 * (4E) = 8E.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{gs}$ = (Energy from n=1) + (Energy from n=2) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**4.

Understand the Basics**\n\n*   **Particles:** The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Being fermions, these particles must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by both its energy level (principal quantum number `n`) and its spin projection (`m_s`).\n*   **Spin States:** For a spin-1/2 particle, there are two possible spin states: spin up (`m_s` = +1/2) and spin down (`m_s` = -1/2).\n*   **Implication of Pauli Principle:** Due to the two spin states, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a single particle of mass `m` in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length `L`, the allowed energy levels are given by:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere `n = 1, 2, 3, ...` is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem defines a base unit of energy `E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}`. So, we can express the single-particle energy levels simply as:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n**3.

The energy contributed is `2 * E_1 = 2 * E = 2E`.\n    *   We place the next two particles into the `n=2` level (one spin up, one spin down). The energy contributed is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (4E) = 8E`.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n        $E_{ground} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n*   **First Excited State (Next Lowest Total Energy)**\n    To get the first excited state, we must promote one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available higher energy level in the least \"expensive\" way (i.e., the smallest energy jump). The ground state configuration has the `n=1` and `n=2` levels filled. The lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`. The cheapest excitation is to move a particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n    *   The new configuration is: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, and 1 particle in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy for this configuration is:\n        $E_{1st\\_excited} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n        $E_{1st\\_excited} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n*   **Second Excited State (Third Lowest Total Energy)**\n    We need to find the configuration with the next lowest energy. Let's consider the possible excitations from the ground state that result in a higher energy than the first excited state (15E).\n    *   **Possibility 1:** Excite a particle from `n=1` (instead of `n=2`) to the lowest empty level `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: 1 particle in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = E + 2(4E) + 9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Possibility 2:** Excite two particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 0 particles in `n=2`, 2 particles in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   **Possibility 3:** Excite one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, 1 particle in `n=4`.\n        *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\n    Comparing the energies of these excited states (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest one after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n    *   $E_{2nd\\_excited} = 18E$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **1.

We create it by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two in n=2.\n*   **Highest Occupied Level:** n=2.\n*   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** n=3.\n*   **Promotion:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **New Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    *   $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n    *   $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider different possibilities for excitation from the ground state and find the one with the lowest energy after the first excited state.\n\nLet's evaluate the energies of possible configurations:\n\n*   **Ground State:** (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2) -> Energy = **10E**\n*   **First Excited State:** (2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3) -> Energy = **15E**\n\nNow let's consider other excitations:\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to the lowest empty state (n=3).\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = \\bf{18E}$.\n\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = \\bf{20E}$.\n\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4 (skipping n=3).\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = \\bf{22E}$.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the Second Excited State has an energy of **18E**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nThis problem requires us to determine the lowest energy states for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Single-Particle States:**\n\n*   **System:** A particle of mass `m` in a 1D infinite potential well of length `L`.\n*   **Energy Levels:** The allowed energy levels for a single particle are quantized and given by the formula:\n    $E_n = n^2 * \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. So, the single-particle energy levels can be written as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   **Spin:** The particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. For each energy level `n`, there are two possible spin states: spin-up ($m_s = +1/2$) and spin-down ($m_s = -1/2$).\n\n**2. Many-Particle System and Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\n\n*   Since the four particles are identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by both its spatial quantum number (`n`) and its spin quantum number (`m_s`).\n*   This means each spatial energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**3. Calculating the System Energies:**\n\nThe total energy of the four-particle system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles. We need to find the configurations of the four particles that result in the lowest possible total energies.\n\n**Ground State (E_gs):**\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the single-particle energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   The lowest energy level is n=1. We can place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E$.\n*   The next lowest energy level is n=2. We place the remaining two particles here. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (2^2 E) = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n**First Excited State (E_1st):**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We can achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2.\n*   The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is:\n    *   Two particles in the n=1 level: Energy = $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E$.\n    *   One particle in the n=2 level: Energy = $1 \\times E_2 = 1 \\times (2^2 E) = 4E$.\n    *   One particle in the n=3 level: Energy = $1 \\times E_3 = 1 \\times (3^2 E) = 9E$.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n**Second Excited State (E_2nd):**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider different possibilities for excitation from the ground state ({2 in n=1, 2 in n=2}):\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote a particle from the n=1 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $(1 \\times 1^2 E) + (2 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote the second particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level (a two-particle excitation).\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1 and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $(2 \\times 1^2 E) + (2 \\times 3^2 E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=4 level.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy: $(2 \\times 1^2 E) + (1 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 4^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of these states (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest energy after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is:\n$E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis sequence of energies matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
