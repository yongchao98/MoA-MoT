  "question": "**Task**: Select the most consistent answer in the following answers surrounded by <<< >>>.\n\n**Question**:\nYou have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\n\nA) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH\nB) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH\nC) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\nD) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the class of compound but doesn't distinguish between the choices.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   The problem states there are no signals corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens, which means there are no C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four options are saturated carboxylic acids, which is consistent with this information.\n    *   The key to solving the problem lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplets) observed:\n        *   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** According to the n+1 rule, this means the proton(s) giving this signal are coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n            *   Coupling to one proton (n=1) gives a **d**oublet (n+1=2).\n            *   Coupling to two protons (n=2) gives a **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n            *   Coupling to three protons (n=3) gives a **q**uartet (n+1=4).\n            *   Therefore, the proton is adjacent to a -CH group, a -CH₂ group, and a -CH₃ group.\n        *   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** Using the same logic, this means a different proton in the molecule is coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n            *   Coupling to one proton (n=1) gives a **d**oublet (n+1=2).\n            *   Coupling to two protons (n=2) gives a **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n            *   Coupling to another, different set of two protons (n=2) gives a second **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n            *   Therefore, this proton is adjacent to a -CH group and two different -CH₂ groups.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n    We will now examine the structure of each option to see if it contains protons that would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. We will use the simple n+1 rule, as is standard for such problems unless diastereotopic effects are explicitly considered.\n\n    *   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n        ```\n              COOH\n              |\n        (2)H- C --CH₃\n              |\n        (3)H- C --CH₃\n              |\n        (4)   CH₂\n              |\n        (5)   CH₃\n        ```\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the two protons at C4 (2H), and the three protons of its methyl group (3H).

This proton's signal is a **dtq**.\n        *   Let's find the proton that gives a **dtt**: The proton at **C3** is coupled to H at C4 (1H, gives a doublet), the two protons at C2 (gives a triplet), and the two protons of its ethyl group's -CH₂- (`b`, gives another triplet).

Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The peak is broad due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the options lies in the complex splitting patterns described. We need to find a structure that has protons matching these descriptions.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1, n+1=2 lines).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3 lines).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, n+1=4 lines).\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This proton is also split by three different sets of neighbors.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1, n+1=2 lines).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3 lines).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to another set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3 lines).\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's draw each structure and predict the splitting patterns for its unique protons. We will number the main carbon chain starting from the carboxyl carbon (C1).\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid**\n`CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **H at C4:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet), H's at C5 (2H, triplet), and H's on its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet) and H's on its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   This structure provides a `dtt` but not a `dtq`. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\nThis formula represents the following structure:\n`CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\nLet's analyze the protons on the main chain:\n*   **H at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The H at C3 (1H) → **doublet**\n    *   The two H's of the ethyl group attached to C4 (2H) → **triplet**\n    *   The three H's of the methyl group at C5 (3H) → **quartet**\n    *   This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n*   **H at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The H at C4 (1H) → **doublet**\n    *   The two H's of the ethyl group attached to C3 (2H) → **triplet**\n    *   The two H's of the CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet**\n    *   This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n*   This structure perfectly matches both pieces of complex splitting information from the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **H at C4:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, d), H's at C5 (3H, q), and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This would be a complex signal (dqd), but not a dtq.\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C4 (1H, d), H's at C2 (2H, t), and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This gives a dqt.\n*   This structure does not match the data.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H, d), H's at C4 (2H, t), and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This gives a dtq. However, let's check for the dtt.\n*   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, d) and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This gives a dq.\n*   This structure provides a `dtq` (or tdq) but not a `dtt`. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure **B**, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, can produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in its ¹H NMR spectrum. The FTIR data is also consistent with this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   \"No vinyl-hydrogens\": This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four options are saturated, so this is consistent.\n    *   \"One of the signals... is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\". This means a specific proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing the doublet (d) splitting (n+1=2).\n        *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing the triplet (t) splitting (n+1=3).\n        *   Three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), causing the quartet (q) splitting (n+1=4).\n        *   Note: The order of the letters (d, t, q) can vary depending on the relative size of the coupling constants (J-values), but the chemical meaning remains the same: the proton is coupled to a 1H, a 2H, and a 3H set of neighbors. We will look for a proton with this environment, which could be described as `dtq`, `dqt`, `tqd`, `tdq`, `qdt`, or `qtd`.\n    *   \"A different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\". This means another specific proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a doublet (d).\n        *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a triplet (t).\n        *   Another, different set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a second triplet (t).\n        *   We are looking for a proton coupled to a 1H, a 2H, and another 2H set of neighbors. This could be described as `dtt` or `tdt`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Structure of Each Option\n\nWe need to interpret the condensed structural formulas and predict the splitting patterns for the protons in each molecule. We will assume a standard linear interpretation of the formulas and use IUPAC naming to clarify the structures.\n\n**A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This formula corresponds to **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH3(5)`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H4**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `H3` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   `CH3(5)` (3 neighbors) -> quartet (q)\n        *   The `CH2` of its ethyl group (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This gives a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**. This matches the `dtq` signal required.\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H3**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `CH2(2)` (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   `H4` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   The `CH2` of its ethyl group (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This gives a **triplet of doublets of triplets (tdt)**. A `tdt` pattern arises from coupling to (2H, 1H, 2H), while a `dtt` arises from (1H, 2H, 2H). Both are split by one proton and two different sets of two protons, resulting in 18 lines (in a first-order spectrum). Given the options, it is highly probable that this `tdt` signal is the one described as `dtt`.\n\n**B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This corresponds to **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(Et)(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH3(5)`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H3**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `H2` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   `CH2(4)` (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   The `CH2` of its ethyl group (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   Does it have a `dqt` signal? Let's check other protons. H2 is a doublet of triplets (`dt`). The `CH2` protons are all doublets of quartets (`dq`). There is no proton coupled to (1H, 2H, 3H).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtt` but lacks a `dqt`.\n\n**C) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This corresponds to **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(Me)(2)-CH(Me)(3)-CH2(4)-CH3(5)`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H3**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `H2` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   `CH2(4)` (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   The `CH3` on its own carbon (3 neighbors) -> quartet (q)\n        *   This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   Does it have a `dtt` signal? No. H2 is a `dq`. H4 is a `dq`. There is no proton coupled to (1H, 2H, 2H).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtq` but lacks a `dtt`.\n\n**D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This corresponds to **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `(CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Proton H3 is coupled to `CH2(2)` (2H, t), `H4` (1H, d), and `CH3` on C3 (3H, q). This gives a `tdq`. This matches the `dtq` requirement.\n    *   Proton H4 is coupled to `H3` (1H, d) and the six protons of the isopropyl group (6H, septet). This gives a `doublet of septets`. It does not have a `dtt` signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtq`-type signal but lacks a `dtt`.\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the splitting patterns for each structure, we find the following:\n*   **A) 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `dqt` signal and a `tdt` signal.\n*   **B) 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `dtt` signal, but no `dqt` signal.\n*   **C) 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `dtq` signal, but no `dtt` signal.\n*   **D) 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `tdq` (or `dqt`) signal, but no `dtt` signal.\n\nOnly structure **A** possesses two different protons that exhibit the required high level of complex splitting: one proton is coupled to a (1H, 2H, 3H) environment, and another is coupled to a (1H, 2H, 2H) or (2H, 1H, 2H) environment. The signal described as `dtt` in the problem corresponds to the `tdt` signal from structure A. Therefore, structure A is the only option that fits all the data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to be very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the options.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four proposed structures are saturated, so they are all consistent with this piece of information.\n*   **\"One of the signals... is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\"**: This is a very complex splitting pattern, which means the proton responsible for this signal is coupled to three different sets of non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d)** implies coupling to **1** neighboring proton.\n    *   **Triplet (t)** implies coupling to **2** neighboring protons.\n    *   **Quartet (q)** implies coupling to **3** neighboring protons.\n    *   Therefore, a proton showing a `dtq` signal must have neighbors: a `CH` group (1H), a `CH₂` group (2H), and a `CH₃` group (3H).\n*   **\"...a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\"**: This proton is also coupled to three different sets of non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d)** implies coupling to **1** neighboring proton.\n    *   **Triplet (t)** implies coupling to **2** neighboring protons.\n    *   **Another Triplet (t)** implies coupling to another, different `CH₂` group (2H).\n    *   Therefore, a proton showing a `dtt` signal must have neighbors: a `CH` group (1H), a `CH₂` group, and another non-equivalent `CH₂` group.\n\n**3. Structural Analysis of the Options**\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each option to see if it can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₂(e)-CH₃(a)`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is adjacent to H(c) (1H), a CH₃ group (3H), and a CH₂(e) group (2H). This would give a **dqt** signal. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **dtt check:** To have a `dtt` signal, a proton needs to be adjacent to one CH and two different CH₂ groups. This molecule only contains one CH₂ group (e). Therefore, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. Option A is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH₂(d)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₃(a)`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is adjacent to H(b) (1H), a CH₂(d) group (2H), and a CH₃ group (3H). This would give a **dqt** signal. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **dtt check:** This molecule only contains one CH₂ group (d). Therefore, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. Option D is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH(c)(Et)-CH(b)(Et)-CH₂(d)CH₃(e)`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is adjacent to H(c) (1H), the CH₂ of its own ethyl substituent (2H), and the CH₂(d) of the backbone (2H). This would give a **dtt** signal. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **dqt check:** To have a `dqt` signal, a proton needs to be adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group. Let's check the protons. None of the CH protons (b or c) are adjacent to a methyl group. The protons of the CH₂ groups (e.g., d) are adjacent to a CH (b) and a CH₃ (e), but not another CH₂ group. They are also adjacent to each other (geminal coupling, 1H). This would result in a `ddq` (doublet of doublets of quartets), not a `dqt`. Option C is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\nFirst, let's determine the correct structure from this condensed formula. The main chain is `C-C(Et)-C(Et)-C-COOH`. To find the IUPAC name, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group. This is a 6-carbon chain, making it a hexanoic acid derivative.\nThe structure is `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\nLet's analyze the key protons in **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**:\n```\n          CH₃(g)   C₂H₅(e,f)\n          |        |\nHOOC-CH₂(a)-CH(b)----CH(c)----CH₂(d)-CH₃(h)\n```\n*   **Proton H(c):** This proton is on carbon 4. It is adjacent to:\n    *   H(b) on carbon 3 (1H) → doublet (d)\n    *   CH₂(d) on carbon 5 (2H) → triplet (t)\n    *   CH₃(g) substituent (3H) → quartet (q)\n    The resulting signal for H(c) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dqt)**. This matches the first described signal.\n\n*   **Proton H(b):** This proton is on carbon 3. It is adjacent to:\n    *   H(c) on carbon 4 (1H) → doublet (d)\n    *   CH₂(a) on carbon 2 (2H) → triplet (t)\n    *   CH₂(e) of its ethyl substituent (2H) → triplet (t)\n    The resulting signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second described signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe structure of 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, which is represented by the condensed formula in option B, is the only one that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data. It is a carboxylic acid, has no vinyl protons, and its structure predicts the presence of both a `dqt` and a `dtt` signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules (containing only single C-C bonds), so this observation is consistent with all of them.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The most crucial pieces of information are the complex splitting patterns observed for two different protons:\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\n**3. Understanding Complex Splitting (n+1 rule)**\n\nThe splitting of a proton's signal is determined by the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons (vicinal coupling). A signal is split into `n+1` peaks, where `n` is the number of neighboring protons.\n\n*   A **doublet (d)** means 1 neighboring proton (`1+1=2`).\n*   A **triplet (t)** means 2 neighboring protons (`2+1=3`).\n*   A **quartet (q)** means 3 neighboring protons (`3+1=4`).\n\nA complex pattern like `dtq` or `dtt` arises when a proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons. To have three neighboring groups, the proton must be on a carbon that is bonded to three other carbons, each bearing protons.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze each structure to see if its protons would produce the observed splitting patterns. We will focus on the methine protons (-CH-), as they are most likely to have multiple, distinct neighbors.\n\n*   **Structure C: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH` (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   `CH3 - CH(b)(CH3) - CH(c)(CH3) - CH2(d) - COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(c):** Is adjacent to `CH2(d)` (2H), `CH(b)` (1H), and its own methyl group (3H).\n        *   Coupling to `CH2(d)` (2H) -> triplet (t)\n        *   Coupling to `CH(b)` (1H) -> doublet (d)\n        *   Coupling to its own methyl (3H) -> quartet (q)\n        *   This proton's signal would be a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **Proton H(b):** Is adjacent to `CH3` at the end (3H), `CH(c)` (1H), and its own methyl group (3H).\n        *   Coupling to terminal `CH3` (3H) -> quartet (q)\n        *   Coupling to `CH(c)` (1H) -> doublet (d)\n        *   Coupling to its own methyl (3H) -> quartet (q)\n        *   This proton's signal would be a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq).

This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **Proton H(d) (alpha-proton):** Is adjacent to `CH(c)` (1H) and its own methyl group (3H). Its signal would be a doublet of quartets (dq). This is **not a dtt**.\n    *   *Conclusion: Structure D is incorrect.*\n\n*   **Structure A: `CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH` (2,3-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n    *   `CH3CH2 - CH(c)(C2H5) - CH(d)(C2H5) - COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(c):** Is adjacent to `CH2` from the main chain (2H), `CH(d)` (1H), and the `CH2` of its ethyl group (2H).\n        *   Coupling to main chain `CH2` (2H) -> triplet (t)\n        *   Coupling to `CH(d)` (1H) -> doublet (d)\n        *   Coupling to ethyl `CH2` (2H) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This proton's signal would be a **dtt**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **Proton H(d) (alpha-proton):** Is adjacent to `CH(c)` (1H) and the `CH2` of its ethyl group (2H). Its signal would be a doublet of triplets (dt). This is **not a dtq**.\n    *   *Conclusion: Structure A is incorrect.*\n\n*   **Structure B: `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`**\n    Let's correctly identify the structure first. The longest chain including the COOH is a pentanoic acid with ethyl groups at positions 3 and 4. So this is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    *   `CH3(a) - CH(b)(C2H5) - CH(c)(C2H5) - CH2(d) - COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(c):** Is adjacent to `CH2(d)` (2H), `CH(b)` (1H), and the `CH2` of its own ethyl group (2H).\n        *   Coupling to `CH2(d)` (2H) -> triplet (t)\n        *   Coupling to `CH(b)` (1H) -> doublet (d)\n        *   Coupling to its ethyl `CH2` (2H) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This proton's signal would be a **dtt**.

Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the candidates.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four candidate structures are saturated, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The most crucial information comes from the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) of two different signals:\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nTo understand these patterns, we use the n+1 rule. A signal is split into n+1 lines by 'n' equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of protons, the multiplicities multiply.\n\n*   A **dtq** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n    *   One proton (1+1 = 2, a **d**oublet)\n    *   Two equivalent protons (2+1 = 3, a **t**riplet)\n    *   Three equivalent protons (3+1 = 4, a **q**uartet)\n*   A **dtt** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n    *   One proton (1+1 = 2, a **d**oublet)\n    *   Two equivalent protons (2+1 = 3, a **t**riplet)\n    *   Another set of two equivalent protons (2+1 = 3, another **t**riplet)\n\nNow, we must analyze the structure of each candidate to see which one would produce both of these signals from two different protons in the molecule.\n\n### **3. Structural Analysis of Candidates**\n\nThe condensed formulas can be ambiguous. Let's interpret them into standard structural drawings and analyze the protons, focusing on the methine (CH) protons on the main carbon chain, as these are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\n*   **Candidate A: `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   ` (CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH `\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to a CH (1H), a CH₂ (2H), and a CH₃ (3H). This would give a **dtq**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule coupled to a CH and two different CH₂ groups. Therefore, it cannot produce a **dtt**.\n\n*   **Candidate C: `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` -> 2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   ` CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH `\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to a CH (1H, at C2), a CH₂ (2H, from the ethyl group), and a CH₃ (3H, the methyl at C3). This gives a **dtq**.\n    *   Again, there is no proton coupled to a CH and two different CH₂ groups, so it cannot produce a **dtt**.\n\n*   **Candidate D: `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` -> 2,3-Diethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   ` CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH `\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to a CH (1H, at C2), a CH₂ (2H, from the main chain ethyl group), and another CH₂ (2H, from the ethyl substituent at C3). This gives a **dtt**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule coupled to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃. Therefore, it cannot produce a **dtq**.\n\n*   **Candidate B: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\n    This formula is ambiguously written. The most plausible chemical structure that can be formed from these atoms and result in the given NMR signals is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n    Let's draw this structure and analyze its protons:\n    ```\n                    CH₃ (at C4)\n                    |\n      CH₃-CH₂---CH---CH---CH₂---COOH\n                         |\n                         CH₂-CH₃ (at C3)\n    ```\n    Let's analyze the two key methine (CH) protons:\n    1.  **Proton at C4 (H-C4):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton at C3 (1H) -> **doublet**\n        *   The CH₂ group at C5 (2H) -> **triplet**\n        *   The CH₃ group attached at C4 (3H) -> **quartet**\n        *   The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n    2.  **Proton at C3 (H-C3):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton at C4 (1H) -> **doublet**\n        *   The CH₂ group at C2 (2H) -> **triplet**\n        *   The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent at C3 (2H) -> **triplet**\n        *   The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid (Option B)** can produce both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n### **1.

Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four candidate molecules are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: For a signal to be split this way, the corresponding proton(s) must be coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1, gives a 1+1 = **doublet**)\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2, gives a 2+1 = **triplet**)\n    *   Three neighboring protons (n=3, gives a 3+1 = **quartet**)\n    This pattern typically arises from a methine proton (-CH-) adjacent to another methine group (-CH-), a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: Similarly, this pattern means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1, gives a 1+1 = **doublet**)\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2, gives a 2+1 = **triplet**)\n    *   Another, different set of two neighboring protons (n=2, gives a 2+1 = **triplet**)\n    This pattern typically arises from a methine proton (-CH-) adjacent to another methine group (-CH-), a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a second, non-equivalent methylene group (-CH₂-).\n\nThe question states that the spectrum contains *both* a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal. We must now examine the structure of each candidate to see which one has protons in environments that would produce both of these specific patterns.\n\n### **3.

This gives a **dt**.\n*   This molecule has a `dtt` but does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtq`.\n\n**D) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n\nLet's parse this formula carefully. It represents: `CH₃ - CH(C₂H₅) - CH(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - COOH`\nLet's number the chain according to IUPAC rules, starting from the carboxyl carbon as C1.\n\n```\n      C₂H₅ C₂H₅\n      |    |\nCH₃--CH--CH--CH₂--COOH\n  (5) (4)  (3)  (2)   (1)\n```\n\nNow let's analyze the key methine protons, H at C3 and H at C4.\n\n*   **H at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The two protons on C2 (-CH₂-) → **triplet**\n    *   The single proton on C4 (-CH-) → **doublet**\n    *   The two protons on its attached ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) → **triplet**\n    The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.

We need to find the molecule whose spectrum would contain both of the complex signals described. The multiplicity (splitting) of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (n) and follows the n+1 rule. A complex splitting pattern like a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" arises when a proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This means a single proton is coupled to:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1).\n    *   A group of two neighboring protons (giving the **t**riplet, n=2).\n    *   A group of three neighboring protons (giving the **q**uartet, n=3).\n    *   In summary, the proton has a {1H, 2H, 3H} set of neighbors.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means a different single proton is coupled to:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1).\n    *   A group of two neighboring protons (giving the first **t**riplet, n=2).\n    *   A different group of two neighboring protons (giving the second **t**riplet, n=2).\n    *   In summary, this proton has a {1H, 2H, 2H} set of neighbors.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each candidate molecule to see which one matches these requirements.

Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) described. We need to find a structure that has protons with the specific environments required to produce these signals.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four proposed saturated structures.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This indicates a single proton (let's call it Hₓ) is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Hₓ is coupled to one adjacent proton (n=1, based on the n+1 rule).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Hₓ is coupled to two adjacent protons (n=2).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Hₓ is coupled to three adjacent protons (n=3).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This indicates a different single proton (let's call it Hᵧ) is also being split by three different sets of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Hᵧ is coupled to one adjacent proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Hᵧ is coupled to two adjacent protons (n=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Hᵧ is coupled to another, different set of two adjacent protons (n=2).\n\nNow, let's examine the structure of each option to see if it matches these NMR requirements. We will focus on the protons attached to the chiral centers (methine, -CH- groups) as they are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`\n*   The proton at C3 is coupled to the C2-H (1H), the C3-CH₃ (3H), and the C4-CH₂ (2H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n*   However, there is no proton in the molecule that is coupled to one proton, a group of two protons, and another group of two protons. Thus, there is no **dtt** signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`\nLet's analyze the two methine (-CH-) protons:\n*   **Proton at C4 (H-C4):**\n    *   It is adjacent to the C5-**CH₃** group (3 neighbors → **quartet**).\n    *   It is adjacent to the **H** at C3 (1 neighbor → **doublet**).\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂** of its ethyl group (2 neighbors → **triplet**).\n    *   The combined splitting pattern is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n*   **Proton at C3 (H-C3):**\n    *   It is adjacent to the **H** at C4 (1 neighbor → **doublet**).\n    *   It is adjacent to the C2-**CH₂** group (2 neighbors → **triplet**).\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂** of its own ethyl group (2 neighbors → **triplet**).\n    *   The combined splitting pattern is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n*   Conclusion: This structure perfectly accounts for both of the complex signals described in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃-CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n*   The proton at C3 is coupled to the C2-H (1H), the C3-ethyl's CH₂ (2H), and the C4-CH₂ (2H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n*   However, there is no proton in the molecule that is coupled to a 1H, a 2H, and a 3H group. Thus, there is no **dtq** signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   The proton at C3 is coupled to the C4-H (1H), the C3-CH₃ (3H), and the C2-CH₂ (2H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n*   Similar to option A, there is no environment that would produce a **dtt** signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure B, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, has protons in the correct chemical environments to produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1.

Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to be very broad.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position (around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is typical for the carbonyl group in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in deciphering the complex splitting patterns described. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent non-equivalent protons (n) according to the (n+1) rule. Complex splitting (multiplet of multiplets) occurs when a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated compounds, which is consistent with this information.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a proton (let's call it H_A) is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet:** H_A is adjacent to one proton (n=1, 1+1=2).\n    *   **Triplet:** H_A is adjacent to a group of two equivalent protons (like a CH₂ group, n=2, 2+1=3).\n    *   **Quartet:** H_A is adjacent to a group of three equivalent protons (like a CH₃ group, n=3, 3+1=4).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton with the following neighbors: a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different proton (let's call it H_B) is also coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet:** H_B is adjacent to one proton (n=1, 1+1=2).\n    *   **Triplet:** H_B is adjacent to a group of two equivalent protons (a CH₂ group, n=2, 2+1=3).\n    *   **Triplet:** H_B is also adjacent to a *different* group of two equivalent protons (another CH₂ group, n=2, 2+1=3).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton with the following neighbors: a CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n**3. Evaluating Each Structure**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it contains protons that would produce both of these specific splitting patterns. We will number the carbon chain starting from the COOH group as carbon 1.\n\n*   **A) 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid (CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH):**\n    *   H at C3 is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ at C3 (3H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to one proton and two different CH₂ groups.

This would give a **triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq)**, which is the same pattern as a dtq. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   There is no proton coupled to one proton and two different CH₂ groups. Thus, it cannot produce Signal 2. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid (CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH):**\n    *   H at C3 is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H), and the CH₂ at C4 (2H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to one proton, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group. Thus, it cannot produce Signal 1. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:**\n    This condensed formula is ambiguous. To determine the structure, we must draw it out and apply IUPAC rules to find the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group.\n    `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n    The longest chain is a heptanoic acid derivative:\n    `COOH(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(5)-CH₂(6)-CH₃(7)`\n    The correct name is **3-ethyl-4-methylheptanoic acid**. Let's analyze the key protons in this structure:\n    *   **H at C4:** This proton is coupled to H at C3 (1H), the CH₃ group attached to C4 (3H), and the CH₂ group at C5 (2H). This environment (neighbors: 1H, 3H, 2H) will produce a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**. This matches the pattern of Signal 1.\n    *   **H at C3:** This proton is coupled to H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H), and the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H). This environment (neighbors: 1H, 2H, 2H) will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option B, which is correctly identified as 3-ethyl-4-methylheptanoic acid, contains protons that would generate both a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid.

Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated compounds, which is consistent with this information.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The spectrum shows two particularly complex signals:\n    1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nTo identify the compound, we need to find a structure that can produce both of these specific splitting patterns. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent non-equivalent protons (n) according to the n+1 rule. For complex splitting, a proton is coupled to multiple different sets of neighboring protons.\n\n*   A **dtq** arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a set of 1 proton (giving a doublet), a set of 2 protons (giving a triplet), and a set of 3 protons (giving a quartet). The neighbor counts are **{1H, 2H, 3H}**.\n*   A **dtt** arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a set of 1 proton (giving a doublet), a set of 2 protons (giving a triplet), and another set of 2 protons (giving another triplet). The neighbor counts are **{1H, 2H, 2H}**.\n\n**3. Analysis of Each Candidate Structure**\n\nFor this analysis, we will analyze the expected splitting for each methine (CH) proton. We will make a common simplifying assumption that protons on a CH₂ group adjacent to a chiral center are \"accidentally equivalent\" and thus split signals into a simple triplet. Without this assumption, the patterns would be much more complex (e.g., doublet of doublets) and would not match the given names (dtq, dtt).\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH₂(d)-COOH`\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H(c)**. Its neighbors are: H(b) (1H), the CH₂(d) group (2H), and the adjacent CH₃ group (3H).\n    *   Neighbor counts for H(c): **{1H, 2H, 3H}**. This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, no other proton in this molecule has the neighbor counts {1H, 2H, 2H} required to produce a dtt. Thus, molecule A is unlikely.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `(CH₃CH₂)-CH(c)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₂CH₃)-COOH`\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H(c)**. Its neighbors are: H(b) (1H), the CH₂ group of the main chain ethyl (2H), and the CH₂ group of the side-chain ethyl (2H).\n    *   Neighbor counts for H(c): **{1H, 2H, 2H}**. This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, no other proton in this molecule has the neighbor counts {1H, 2H, 3H} required to produce a dtq. Thus, molecule B is unlikely.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,5-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `(CH₃)-CH(b)(C₂H₅)-CH₂-CH(d)(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   Proton H(b) neighbors: {CH₃(3H), main-chain CH₂(2H), ethyl CH₂(2H)}. This gives a qtt (quartet of triplets of triplets).\n    *   Proton H(d) neighbors: {main-chain CH₂(2H), alpha-CH₂(2H), ethyl CH₂(2H)}. This gives a ttt (triplet of triplets of triplets).\n    *   This molecule produces neither a dtq nor a dtt.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `(CH₃CH₂)(b)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(f)(CH₃)-COOH`\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H(c)**. Its neighbors are: the CH₂(b) group (2H), proton H(f) (1H), and the adjacent CH₃ group (3H).\n    *   Neighbor counts for H(c): **{2H, 1H, 3H}**. This would produce a **tqd** (triplet of quartets of doublets) or **dtq**, depending on the relative coupling constants. This matches the first required signal.\n    *   Now let's search for the **dtt** {1H, 2H, 2H}. A simple analysis of the other protons (H(f), CH₂(b)) does not reveal a dtt pattern.\n\n**Revisiting the Problem and Conclusion**\n\nA rigorous analysis shows that none of the molecules perfectly produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. This suggests a potential typo in the problem description. However, we must choose the best fit. Let's reconsider the possibility. The problem description is highly specific. It is very likely that one of the structures does in fact produce these signals, possibly through a combination of factors like conformation and coupling constants that are not immediately obvious from a simplified analysis.\n\nLet's re-examine molecule C, which is a strong candidate for the `dtq`.\n`CH₃(a)-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(CH₃d)-CH(f)(CH₃e)-COOH`\n- H(c) is coupled to H(f) (1H), CH₂(b) (2H), and CH₃(d) (3H). This is a solid candidate for the **dtq**.\n- Let's reconsider the protons on CH₂(b), Hb' and Hb''. They are diastereotopic. Each is coupled to the three protons of CH₃(a), the single proton H(c), and each other (one proton). This gives a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq).\n\nThere appears to be a contradiction in the problem statement vs. standard analysis. However, if we assume there is an intended answer, we must find the best fit. Let's reconsider the options. Molecule C clearly has a proton (H(c)) with the required neighbors {1H, 2H, 3H} to give a dtq. While the dtt is not obvious, it's possible that complex conformational effects on the CH₂(b) protons could lead to this pattern, or that there is a typo in the question where \"dtt\" should have been another pattern present in C, like \"dq\" (from H(f)). Given that C provides a perfect match for the most complex signal (the dtq), it remains the most plausible candidate.\n\nLet's assume the question is correct. If we carefully re-examine structure C, the proton H(c) is coupled to H(f) (1H), CH3(d) (3H), and CH2(b) (2H), giving the dtq. The other complex signal, the dtt, must come from one of the CH2(b) protons. For one of these protons to be a dtt, it needs neighbours of {1H, 2H, 2H}. It is coupled to its geminal partner (1H) and H(c) (1H) and the CH3(a) group (3H). It seems there is an error in the question, but C is the only compound that contains a proton with neighbours {1H, 2H, 3H} which gives a dtq, and another proton on the alpha-carbon with neighbours {1H, 3H} which gives a dq. Comparing dtq and dq to dtq and dtt, it seems the most plausible option.\n\nFinal decision leans towards C as it's the only one providing a clear origin for the highly specific `dtq` signal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.

Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four options are saturated molecules, consistent with this observation.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The crucial information lies in the complex splitting patterns observed for two different protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nTo understand these patterns, we use the n+1 rule. A complex splitting pattern like 'dtq' means a single proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This proton must be coupled to:\n    *   1 adjacent proton (d, from 1+1=2)\n    *   2 adjacent protons (t, from 2+1=3)\n    *   3 adjacent protons (q, from 3+1=4)\n    Therefore, we are looking for a proton with neighbors of (1H, 2H, and 3H).\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This proton must be coupled to:\n    *   1 adjacent proton (d, from 1+1=2)\n    *   2 adjacent protons (t, from 2+1=3)\n    *   Another, different set of 2 adjacent protons (t, from 2+1=3)\n    Therefore, we are looking for a proton with neighbors of (1H, 2H, and 2H).\n\nThe correct structure must have **both** of these proton environments.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Proposed Structure**\n\nLet's systematically name and analyze the protons in each option.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(e)-CH₂(d)-CH(c)(CH₃(f))-CH(b)(CH₃(g))-COOH(a)`\n*   **Proton Hc (at C3):** Neighbors are Hd (2H), Hb (1H), and Hf (3H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This matches the requirement for a **dtq**.\n*   **Does it have a dtt?** We need a proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H). No proton in this molecule fits this description.\n*   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(e)-CH₂(d)-CH(c)(C₂H₅(f,g))-CH(b)(C₂H₅(h,i))-COOH(a)`\n*   **Proton Hc (at C3):** Neighbors are Hb (1H), Hd (2H), and Hf (2H, from the ethyl group). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 2H). This matches the requirement for a **dtt**.\n*   **Does it have a dtq?** We need a proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H). No proton in this molecule fits this description.\n*   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(e)-CH(d)(CH₃(f))-CH(c)(CH₃(g))-CH₂(b)-COOH(a)`\n*   **Proton Hc (at C3):** Neighbors are Hd (1H), Hb (2H), and Hg (3H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This matches the requirement for a **dtq**.\n*   **Does it have a dtt?** We need a proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H). No proton in this molecule fits this description.\n*   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\nThe condensed formula is ambiguous, but it is the only remaining option. Let's assume it represents 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, which has the same molecular formula (C₉H₁₈O₂).\nStructure: `CH₃(a)-CH(b)(C₂H₅(c,d))-CH(e)(C₂H₅(f,g))-CH₂(h)-COOH(i)`\n*   **Proton Hb (at C4):** Its neighbors are Ha (3H), He (1H), and Hc (2H, from the ethyl group). The neighbors are **(1H, 2H, 3H)**. This matches the requirement for a **dtq**.\n*   **Proton He (at C3):** Its neighbors are Hb (1H), Hh (2H), and Hf (2H, from the ethyl group). The neighbors are **(1H, 2H, 2H)**. This matches the requirement for a **dtt**.\n\n**Conclusion:** This structure contains a proton (Hb) that would produce a dtq signal and a different proton (He) that would produce a dtt signal. This matches the experimental data perfectly.\n\n### **Final Identification**\n\nThe only compound that has proton environments corresponding to both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) is 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, which is represented by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Provided Information**\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n        *   Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹: This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n        *   Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹: This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms we are on the right track but doesn't distinguish between them.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   No vinyl-hydrogens: This means there are no protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all options.\n        *   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This tells us about the neighbors of a specific proton. For a signal to be a `dtq`, the proton must be coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n            *   One neighboring proton (gives the `d` for doublet, n+1=2 -> n=1).\n            *   Two neighboring protons (gives the `t` for triplet, n+1=3 -> n=2).\n            *   Three neighboring protons (gives the `q` for quartet, n+1=4 -> n=3).\n            *   So, we are looking for a proton with 1H, 2H, and 3H as neighbors. The order (`d`, `t`, `q`) depends on the relative size of the coupling constants (J-values), but the set of neighbors is fixed.\n        *   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** Using the same logic:\n            *   One neighboring proton (`d`).\n            *   Two neighboring protons (`t`).\n            *   Another two neighboring protons (`t`).\n            *   So, we are looking for a proton with 1H, 2H, and 2H as neighbors.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Proposed Structure**\n\n    The core of the problem is to see which of the four molecules has protons that match *both* of these complex splitting patterns. We need to draw each structure and analyze the environment of each unique proton (specifically the methine, -CH-, protons as they are most likely to have many different neighbors).\n\n    *   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n        `COOH(1)-CH(Et)(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n        *   Let's analyze H at C3: `...-CH(2)-CH(3)-CH₂(4)-...` and an ethyl group on C3. Its neighbors are: H at C2 (1H), the `CH₂` of the attached ethyl group (2H), and the `CH₂` at C4 (2H).\n        *   Neighbors: 1H, 2H, 2H. This matches the requirement for the **dtt** signal.\n        *   Let's look for a `dtq` (1H, 2H, 3H neighbors). H at C2 has neighbors H-C3 (1H) and `CH₂` of its ethyl group (2H) -> `dt`. The `CH₂` protons in this molecule are diastereotopic and would give `ddq` signals (1H, 1H, 3H neighbors). So, structure A has the `dtt` but not the `dtq`.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        `COOH(1)-CH(Me)(2)-CH(Me)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n        *   Let's analyze H at C3: Its neighbors are: H at C2 (1H), the `CH₃` group on C3 (3H), and the `CH₂` at C4 (2H).\n        *   Neighbors: 1H, 3H, 2H. This matches the requirement for the **dtq** signal.\n        *   Let's look for a `dtt` (1H, 2H, 2H neighbors). No other proton in the molecule has this set of neighbors. H at C2 gives a `dq`. So, structure B has the `dtq` but not the `dtt`.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        `COOH(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Me)(3)-CH(Me)(4)-CH₃(5)`\n        *   H at C3: Neighbors are `CH₂` at C2 (2H), H at C4 (1H), `CH₃` on C3 (3H). This gives a `tdq`.\n        *   H at C4: Neighbors are H at C3 (1H), `CH₃` on C4 (3H), `CH₃` at C5 (3H). This gives a `dqq`.\n        *   This structure has neither a `dtq` nor a `dtt`.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n        Let's draw this carefully:\n        `COOH(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH(Et)(4)-CH₃(5)`\n        This is the correct connectivity based on the condensed formula.\n        Now, let's analyze the two different methine (-CH-) protons.\n        *   **Analyze H at C4:** `...-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH₃(5)` and an ethyl group on C4. Its neighbors are: H at C3 (1H), the `CH₃` group at C5 (3H), and the `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2H).\n        *   Neighbors: 1H, 3H, 2H. This set of neighbors matches the requirement for the **dtq** signal.\n        *   **Analyze H at C3:** `...-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-...` and an ethyl group on C3. Its neighbors are: the `CH₂` group at C2 (2H), H at C4 (1H), and the `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2H).\n        *   Neighbors: 2H, 1H, 2H. This set of neighbors matches the requirement for the **dtt** signal (or more specifically, a `tdt`, but they arise from the same neighbor set of 1H, 2H, 2H).\n\n3.  **Conclusion**\n    Structure C, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is the only compound that contains a proton environment that would produce a `dtq` (the proton at C4) AND another proton environment that would produce a `dtt` (the proton at C3). Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position (1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent with all possibilities.\n\n### **2.

This signal is present.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure C has a `dtq` but lacks a `dtt`. It is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n      C₂H₅(d) C₂H₅(c)\n       |       |\nCH₃(e)-CH(b) - CH(a) - CH₂(f) - COOH\n```\nLet's analyze the protons on the main chain, `H(a)` and `H(b)`.\n*   **Proton H(a) (on carbon 3):** This proton is coupled to three distinct neighbors:\n    *   `H(b)` on carbon 4 (1H) → **doublet (d)**\n    *   `CH₂(f)` on carbon 2 (2H) → **triplet (t)**\n    *   `CH₂` of the ethyl group `c` on carbon 3 (2H) → **triplet (t)**\n    This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n*   **Proton H(b) (on carbon 4):** This proton is also coupled to three distinct neighbors:\n    *   `H(a)` on carbon 3 (1H) → **doublet (d)**\n    *   `CH₂` of the ethyl group `d` on carbon 4 (2H) → **triplet (t)**\n    *   `CH₃(e)` on carbon 5 (3H) → **quartet (q)**\n    This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second observed signal.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure D is the only one that can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Final Identification**\n\nThe FTIR and ¹H NMR data are fully consistent with the structure of 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, which is represented by the formula `CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1.

Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe ¹H NMR data provides the structural details needed to distinguish between the isomers.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of any C=C double bonds in the molecule.

A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nLet's break down what these splitting patterns mean in terms of neighboring protons:\n*   **Doublet of Triplets of Quartets (dtq):** For a proton to be split into a dtq, it must be coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (CH) to cause the **doublet (d)** splitting (n+1 = 1+1=2).\n    *   A set of two equivalent protons (a CH₂ group) to cause the **triplet (t)** splitting (n+1 = 2+1=3).\n    *   A set of three equivalent protons (a CH₃ group) to cause the **quartet (q)** splitting (n+1 = 3+1=4).\n*   **Doublet of Triplets of Triplets (dtt):** For a proton to be split into a dtt, it must be coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (CH) to cause the **doublet (d)** splitting (n+1 = 1+1=2).\n    *   A set of two equivalent protons (a CH₂ group) to cause one **triplet (t)** splitting (n+1 = 2+1=3).\n    *   Another, chemically non-equivalent set of two protons (another CH₂ group) to cause the second **triplet (t)** splitting.\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nNow we must examine each of the four proposed structures to see which one has protons in the specific environments required to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. The condensed formulas are written ambiguously, so we will interpret them into their most likely IUPAC structures.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   This structure has a proton at C3 that could be a `dtq`, but it lacks a proton that could be a `dtt`.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   This structure has a proton at C3 that could be a `dtt`, but it lacks a proton that could be a `dtq`.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   This structure has a proton at C3 that could be a `dtq`, but it lacks a proton that could be a `dtt`.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n    *   Let's interpret the ambiguous formula as `(CH₃)(C₂H₅)CH-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`. The longest carbon chain containing the COOH group determines the parent name. This chain is 6 carbons long (hexanoic acid), with a methyl group at C4 and an ethyl group at C3.\n    *   **Structure:**\n        ```\n                      CH₃ (methyl on C4)\n                      |\n        CH₃-CH₂-CH-CH-CH₂-COOH\n                         |\n                         CH₂CH₃ (ethyl on C3)\n        Carbon number: 6   5   4  3  2    1\n        ```\n    *   **Let's check for the `dtt` signal:**\n        *   Consider the proton on **C3**.\n        *   Its neighbors are: the proton on C4 (1H), the protons on C2 (2H), and the protons on the ethyl group's CH₂ (2H).\n        *   Splitting: `doublet` (from C4-H) of `triplets` (from C2-H₂) of `triplets` (from ethyl-H₂).\n        *   This proton gives a **dtt** signal.\n\n    *   **Let's check for the `dtq` signal:**\n        *   Consider the proton on **C4**.\n        *   Its neighbors are: the proton on C3 (1H), the protons on C5 (2H), and the protons of the methyl group at C4 (3H).\n        *   Splitting: `doublet` (from C3-H) of `triplets` (from C5-H₂) of `quartets` (from methyl-H₃).\n        *   This proton gives a **dtq** signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe structure corresponding to option C, **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**, is the only one that contains both a proton environment that would result in a `doublet of triplets of triplets` and a different proton environment that would result in a `doublet of triplets of quartets`. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The peak is characteristically very broad, often spanning from ~2500 cm⁻¹ to ~3300 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. A value around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the carbonyl group in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them. We must use the NMR data to differentiate them.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe crucial information lies in the complex splitting patterns observed for two different signals:\n*   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nThe multiplicity of a proton's signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (n) according to the n+1 rule. For complex splitting, we consider each group of neighboring protons separately.\n*   Doublet (d): Coupling to 1 neighboring proton.\n*   Triplet (t): Coupling to 2 neighboring protons.\n*   Quartet (q): Coupling to 3 neighboring protons.\n\nTherefore:\n*   **dtq** implies a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one group with 1 proton, one group with 2 protons, and one group with 3 protons.\n*   **dtt** implies a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one group with 1 proton, one group with 2 protons, and another group with 2 protons.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each option to see which one would produce both of these signals. We'll determine the IUPAC name for each condensed formula to have a clear structure.\n\n---\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid**\n`COOH(1)-CH(a)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₂(c)-CH₃(d)`\n*   Let's analyze the proton `H(b)`. It is coupled to `H(a)` (1 neighbor), the `CH₂(c)` group (2 neighbors), and its attached `CH₃` group... wait, no. Vicinal coupling is to neighbors on adjacent carbons. So, `H(b)` is coupled to `H(a)` (1H) and `CH₂(c)` (2H). There is also a methyl group on the same carbon, but that is not vicinal coupling. Let's re-read the structure, the formula must be `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. The chain is 6 carbons long. Let's draw it and label the protons.\n`CH₃(d)-CH₂(c)-CH(b)(CH₃(f))-CH(a)(CH₃(e))-COOH`\n*   **`H(b)`:** Coupled to `H(a)` (1H), `CH₂(c)` (2H), and the protons of the methyl group `CH₃(f)` (3H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This would result in a **dtq** signal. So, this molecule has a `dtq` signal.\n*   **`dtt` signal?** A `dtt` requires (1H, 2H, 2H) neighbors. No proton in this molecule has this combination of neighbors. Thus, compound A is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(d)-CH₂(c)-CH(b)(C₂H₅(g))-CH(a)(C₂H₅(f))-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze the proton `H(b)`. It is coupled to `H(a)` (1H), the `CH₂(c)` group (2H), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl substituent `C₂H₅(g)` (2H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 2H). This would result in a **dtt** signal. So, this molecule has a `dtt` signal.\n*   **`dtq` signal?** A `dtq` requires (1H, 2H, 3H) neighbors. No proton in this molecule has this specific combination. For example, the diastereotopic protons of `CH₂(c)` are coupled to `H(b)` (1H), `CH₃(d)` (3H), and each other (1H), which would give a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq), not a `dtq`. Thus, compound C is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(d)-CH(c)(CH₃(f))-CH(b)(CH₃(e))-CH₂(a)-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze the proton `H(b)`. It is coupled to `H(c)` (1H), the `CH₂(a)` group (2H), and the protons of its methyl substituent `CH₃(e)` (3H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This would result in a **dtq** signal.\n*   **`dtt` signal?** A `dtt` requires (1H, 2H, 2H) neighbors. No proton in this molecule has this combination. Thus, compound D is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(d)-CH(c)(C₂H₅(g))-CH(b)(C₂H₅(f))-CH₂(a)-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze proton **`H(b)`**. It is coupled to the `CH₂(a)` group (2H), `H(c)` (1H), and the `CH₂` protons of its ethyl substituent `C₂H₅(f)` (2H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 2H). This proton would show a **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets) splitting pattern. **This matches one of the required signals.**\n*   Let's analyze proton **`H(c)`**. It is coupled to `H(b)` (1H), the `CH₃(d)` group (3H), and the `CH₂` protons of its ethyl substituent `C₂H₅(g)` (2H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This proton would show a **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets) splitting pattern. **This matches the other required signal.**\n\nConclusion: Compound B is the only structure that has one proton (`H(b)`) that would produce a `dtt` signal and another proton (`H(c)`) that would produce a `dtq` signal. Therefore, it is the correct structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the range of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding (dimerization).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong, sharp peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretching in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the choices. The absence of peaks in the vinyl region (around 1650 cm⁻¹ for C=C and 3010-3100 cm⁻¹ for =C-H) is also consistent with the NMR data.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in interpreting the complex splitting patterns described. The multiplicity of a signal is given by the `n+1` rule, where `n` is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons, the splitting pattern becomes a \"multiplet of multiplets.\"\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighbors.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** It's coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** It's coupled to a group of two neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** It's coupled to a group of three neighboring protons (n=3).\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a different proton is also being split by three different groups of neighbors.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** It's coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** It's coupled to a group of two neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Another Triplet (t):** It's coupled to another, different group of two neighboring protons (n=2).\n\nThese highly complex splitting patterns typically arise from methine protons (CH) in a complex, chiral environment. We must now examine the structure of each option to see which one contains protons that would produce these specific signals.\n\n**3.

Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.

Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving the problem lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The \"n+1\" rule states that a proton signal is split into n+1 lines by n equivalent neighboring protons. A complex splitting pattern like \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" means a single proton is being coupled by three different groups of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a proton is coupled to:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving a **d**oublet, 1+1=2 lines).\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (giving a **t**riplet, 2+1=3 lines).\n        *   A group of three equivalent neighboring protons (giving a **q**uartet, 3+1=4 lines).\n    *   For this to occur, a methine proton (-CH-) must be adjacent to another methine group (-CH-), a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a proton is coupled to:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving a **d**oublet, 1+1=2 lines).\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (giving a **t**riplet, 2+1=3 lines).\n        *   Another different group of two equivalent neighboring protons (giving another **t**riplet, 2+1=3 lines).\n    *   For this to occur, a methine proton (-CH-) must be adjacent to another methine group (-CH-), a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a second, non-equivalent methylene group (-CH₂-).\n\nThe problem states that the compound's spectrum contains **both** of these signals.

Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The peak is broad due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with the carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the candidates.\n\n### **2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe most distinguishing information comes from the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds. All four structures are saturated, which is consistent with this data.\n*   **Key Signals:** The spectrum contains two particularly complex signals:\n    *   **Signal 1:** A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   **Signal 2:** A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nTo have these multiplicities, a proton must be coupled to three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups of protons.\n*   A **dtq** arises from a proton being split by:\n    *   One adjacent proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n    *   A group of two adjacent protons (like a CH₂ group), giving the **t**riplet.\n    *   A group of three adjacent protons (like a CH₃ group), giving the **q**uartet.\n*   A **dtt** arises from a proton being split by:\n    *   One adjacent proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n    *   A group of two adjacent protons (like a CH₂ group), giving the first **t**riplet.\n    *   Another, different group of two adjacent protons (another CH₂ group), giving the second **t**riplet.\n\n### **3. Analyze Each Candidate Structure**\n\nWe need to find the structure that contains one proton environment that would produce a `dtq` and another that would produce a `dtt`. Let's represent the structures by their IUPAC names derived from the condensed formulas.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(CH₃)(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), H at C4 (2H, triplet), and the C3-methyl (3H, quartet). This proton would be a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to three neighbors consisting of one proton, two protons, and another two protons. Therefore, there is no `dtt` signal. Structure A is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH(CH₃)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet), H at C2 (2H, triplet), and the C3-methyl (3H, quartet). This proton would be a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   Like structure A, there is no proton environment that would lead to a `dtt` signal. Structure C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH(Et)(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), H at C4 (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This proton would be a **dtt**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **H at C2**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **dt** (doublet of triplets), not a `dtq`. Since there is no `dtq` signal, structure D is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH(Et)(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    Let's examine the two methine (CH) protons on the main chain, at C3 and C4.\n    *   **Proton at C4**: It is adjacent to three different groups of protons:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → doublet (d)\n        2.  The protons of the ethyl group at C4 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        3.  The protons of the methyl group at C5 (3H) → quartet (q)\n        The multiplicity is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **Proton at C3**: It is also adjacent to three different groups of protons:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → doublet (d)\n        2.  The protons of the CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        3.  The protons of the ethyl group at C3 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        The multiplicity is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n\n**Conclusion:** Structure B is the only candidate that has protons matching both the `dtq` and `dtt` signals described in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to be very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all candidates but does not distinguish between them.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data - The Splitting Patterns**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the 1H NMR spectrum. We need to find the molecule that has protons with the specific environments required to produce these signals.\n\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a single proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups of protons.\n    *   `doublet (d)`: implies coupling to **one** neighboring proton (n=1, n+1=2).\n    *   `triplet (t)`: implies coupling to **two** equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3).\n    *   `quartet (q)`: implies coupling to **three** equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, n+1=4).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton (let's call it Hx) with this specific neighborhood: `-CHx - CH(1H) - CH2(2H) - CH3(3H)`. The order `d`, `t`, `q` depends on the relative size of the coupling constants (J-values), so a `dqt`, `tdq`, or `qdt` all point to the same arrangement of neighbors.\n\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a single proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups of protons.\n    *   `doublet (d)`: implies coupling to **one** neighboring proton.\n    *   `triplet (t)`: implies coupling to **two** equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   `triplet (t)`: implies coupling to another, different group of **two** equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton (let's call it Hy) with this specific neighborhood: `-CHy - CH(1H) - CH2(2H) - CH2(2H)`.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Each Candidate Molecule**\n\nLet's examine the structure of each candidate to see if any proton matches the required environments for a `dtt` and a `dtq`. We'll focus on the methine (CH) protons, as they are most likely to have multiple distinct neighbors. For simplicity in this initial analysis, we will treat protons on a `CH2` group as equivalent, which gives rise to triplets in neighboring protons (this is a standard simplifying assumption in introductory NMR, although in reality they are often diastereotopic and give more complex patterns).\n\n**A) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH2-CH(b)(CH3)-CH(c)(CH3)2`\n*   H(b) is adjacent to a CH2 (2H), a CH(c) (1H), and a CH3 (3H). This matches the neighbor requirement (1H, 2H, 3H) for a **dtq** (or tdq).\n*   No proton in this molecule is adjacent to two different CH2 groups. Therefore, it **cannot produce a dtt** signal.\n\n**B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH → 3-ethyl-5-methylhexanoic acid (based on plausible parsing)**\n`HOOC-CH2-CH(b)(C2H5)-CH2-CH(d)(CH3)2`\n*   H(b) is adjacent to three CH2 groups. It would be a `ttt` (triplet of triplets of triplets), not a `dtt`.\n*   This structure does not fit the data.\n\n**C) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3CH2(i)-CH(b)(C2H5)-CH(a)(C2H5)-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze proton H(b) on carbon 3. It is adjacent to:\n    1.  The H(a) proton on carbon 2 (**1H**). This causes a `doublet`.\n    2.  The CH2 group of the ethyl side-chain on carbon 3 (**2H**). This causes a `triplet`.\n    3.  The CH2(i) group on carbon 4 of the main chain (**2H**). This causes another `triplet`.\n*   This environment (neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 2H) is a perfect match for a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   Now let's check for a dtq. A proton in one of the diastereotopic CH2 groups, for example in the C2-ethyl group `CH(a)-CH2(f)-CH3(g)`, would be coupled to its geminal partner (1H), the vicinal H(a) (1H), and the vicinal CH3 (3H). This would give a `ddq` (doublet of doublets of quartets), not a `dtq`. However, given that this is the only molecule that can produce the highly specific `dtt` signal, we can be confident this is the correct structure. The `dtq` mentioned might be a description of a complex multiplet that appears like a `dtq` or it's possible that this compound has a signal that fits `dtq` due to other factors.\n\n**D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3CH2(g)-CH(b)(CH3)-CH(a)(CH3)-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze proton H(b) on carbon 3. It is adjacent to:\n    1.  The H(a) proton on carbon 2 (**1H**). `doublet`.\n    2.  The CH2(g) group on carbon 4 (**2H**). `triplet`.\n    3.  The methyl (CH3) group on carbon 3 (**3H**). `quartet`.\n*   This environment (neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 3H) is a perfect match for a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   However, let's check for a `dtt`. No proton in this molecule is adjacent to two different CH2 groups. Therefore, it **cannot produce a dtt** signal.\n\n### **Step 4: Conclusion**\n\n*   Molecule **C** is the only candidate that possesses the structural features to produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** signal.\n*   Molecule **D** is the only candidate that possesses the structural features to produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** signal.\n\nSince the problem states that the NMR spectrum shows *both* a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal, and they are from different protons, there appears to be a contradiction if we strictly follow the simplified analysis for both signals. However, the requirement for a `dtt` signal is structurally very constrained. Only a proton neighbored by a CH, a CH2, and another CH2 can produce this pattern. Only molecule **C** has this feature. The `dtt` is the more definitive and uncommon pattern. Therefore, the compound must be **C**. The signal described as a `dtq` must also arise from this molecule, likely from a more complex multiplet (like a `ddq`) that is being described this way.\n\nThe presence of the `dtt` signal is the deciding piece of evidence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated, which is consistent with this information.\n    *   **Key Information:** The spectrum contains two very specific and complex signals:\n        1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n        2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Splitting Patterns:**\n    The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of neighboring protons (n) according to the n+1 rule. For coupling to multiple, non-equivalent groups of protons, the multiplicities are multiplied.\n    *   **dtq (doublet of triplets of quartets):** This means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (d, doublet).\n        *   A group of two equivalent protons (t, triplet).\n        *   A group of three equivalent protons (q, quartet).\n        This pattern arises from a proton in a `CH` group that is adjacent to another `CH` group, a `CH2` group, and a `CH3` group.\n    *   **dtt (doublet of triplets of triplets):** This means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (d, doublet).\n        *   A group of two equivalent protons (t, triplet).\n        *   A *different* group of two equivalent protons (t, triplet).\n        This pattern arises from a proton in a `CH` group that is adjacent to another `CH` group, a `CH2` group, and another `CH2` group (e.g., in an ethyl group).\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Structure (using a first-order approximation):**\n\n    *   **A) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH -> 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        ` (CH3)2CH(4)-CH(3)(CH3)-CH2(2)-COOH `\n        The proton on C3 is coupled to H on C4 (1H, gives a doublet), the `CH2` on C2 (2H, gives a triplet), and the `CH3` on C3 (3H, gives a quartet). This produces a **dtq**. However, there is no proton environment that would produce a `dtt`.\n\n    *   **B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH -> 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid**\n        ` CH3CH2(4)-CH(3)(C2H5)-CH(2)(C2H5)-COOH `\n        The proton on C3 is coupled to H on C2 (1H, doublet), the `CH2` on C4 (2H, triplet), and the `CH2` of the ethyl group attached to C3 (2H, triplet). This produces a **dtt**. However, there is no proton environment that would produce a `dtq`.\n\n    *   **C) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH -> 3,5-diethylhexanoic acid**\n        ` CH3-CH(5)(Et)-CH2(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH2(2)-COOH `\n        The methine protons on C3 and C5 are only adjacent to `CH2` groups. Their signals would not start with a doublet. For example, the proton on C3 is coupled to three different `CH2` groups, which would result in a triplet of triplets of triplets (`ttt`). This does not match.\n\n    *   **D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH -> 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        ` CH3CH2(4)-CH(3)(CH3)-CH(2)(CH3)-COOH `\n        Let's analyze the methine proton on C3.\n        *   It is adjacent to the methine proton (`CH`) on C2. This coupling gives a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the methylene protons (`CH2`) on C4. This coupling gives a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the methyl protons (`CH3`) also on C3. This coupling gives a **quartet (q)**.\n        *   Combining these gives a signal that is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first piece of NMR data.\n        *   Now, let's look for a `dtt` signal. No other proton in this molecule fits the neighbor requirement (1H, 2H, 2H) to produce a `dtt` based on a first-order analysis.\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Resolution:**\n    Based on a standard (first-order) analysis of the structures:\n    *   Molecule D (and A) produces a `dtq`.\n    *   Molecule B produces a `dtt`.\n    *   No single molecule appears to produce both signals.\n\n    This suggests a possible issue with the problem statement or that a more complex NMR effect (like diastereotopicity leading to an unusual apparent pattern) is at play. However, in such problems, we must select the best fit. The `dtq` signal from the proton at C3 in structure D is a textbook example matching the environment `CH2-CH(CH3)-CH`. This provides a very strong match for one of the two unique signals described. No other molecule provides such a clear-cut explanation for this specific and highly complex pattern while also being a plausible candidate for the other complex patterns that can arise from its structure (e.g., diastereotopic protons). Given that molecule D perfectly explains the very complex `dtq` signal, it is the most likely candidate, even with the ambiguity surrounding the `dtt` signal (which might arise from a misinterpretation of a complex multiplet or a non-ideal spectrum).\n\nTherefore, compound D is the most logical choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid. The peak is broad due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.

Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four options are saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids, which is consistent with this information.\n*   **Key splitting patterns:** The most crucial pieces of information are the complex splitting patterns observed for two different signals:\n    *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n**3. Decoding the Splitting Patterns**\n\nThe multiplicity of a signal is given by the (n+1) rule, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. A complex splitting pattern like a \"doublet of triplets\" means the proton is being split by two different, non-equivalent groups of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** For a proton to show this pattern, it must be coupled to three different neighboring groups of protons:\n    *   A group with 1 proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A group with 2 protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   A group with 3 protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n    This implies a methine (CH) proton must be adjacent to a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** For a proton to show this pattern, it must be coupled to three different neighboring groups of protons:\n    *   A group with 1 proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A group with 2 protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   Another, chemically different group with 2 protons (n=2, gives another triplet).\n    This implies a methine (CH) proton must be adjacent to a CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n**4.

We are given two very complex and specific splitting patterns:\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a single proton is being split by three different neighboring groups of protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** It is coupled to **one** adjacent proton (n=1, n+1=2 lines).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** It is coupled to a group of **two** equivalent adjacent protons (n=2, n+1=3 lines).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** It is coupled to a group of **three** equivalent adjacent protons (n=3, n+1=4 lines).\n    *   **Environment needed:** A methine proton (`-CH-`) must be adjacent to another `-CH-` group, a `-CH₂-` group, and a `-CH₃` group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a different single proton is being split by three different neighboring groups.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** It is coupled to **one** adjacent proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** It is coupled to a group of **two** equivalent adjacent protons (n=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** It is coupled to another, different group of **two** equivalent adjacent protons (n=2).\n    *   **Environment needed:** A methine proton (`-CH-`) must be adjacent to another `-CH-` group and two different `-CH₂-` groups.\n\nThe correct compound must have both of these environments in its structure.\n\n### **3. Evaluating Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of each option to see if it contains protons that would produce these signals. We'll simplify by assuming ideal splitting and that diastereotopic protons behave as equivalent groups for this analysis.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₃(h)-CH(a)(C₂H₅)-CH(f)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(g)-COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(a) (at C4):** This proton is on a `-CH-` carbon. Its neighbors are:\n        *   `H(f)` at C3 (1 proton) → creates a **doublet**.\n        *   `-CH₂-` of the ethyl group at C4 (2 protons) → creates a **triplet**.\n        *   `-CH₃(h)` group at C5 (3 protons) → creates a **quartet**.\n        *   The combined splitting is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **Proton H(f) (at C3):** This proton is on a `-CH-` carbon. Its neighbors are:\n        *   `H(a)` at C4 (1 proton) → creates a **doublet**.\n        *   `-CH₂(g)-` group at C2 (2 protons) → creates a **triplet**.\n        *   `-CH₂-` of the ethyl group at C3 (2 protons) → creates another **triplet**.\n        *   The combined splitting is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This molecule has both the required proton environments.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₃-CH(a)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(b) at C3:** Neighbors are `H(a)` (1H), the `-CH₂-` at C2 (2H), and the `-CH₃` at C3 (3H). This creates a **dtq**.\n    *   **Proton H(a) at C4:** Neighbors are `H(b)` (1H), the `-CH₃` on C4 (3H), and the `-CH₃` at C5 (3H). This creates a doublet of quartets of quartets (`dqq`), not a `dtt`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This molecule does not have a proton that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₃CH₂-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH(a)(CH₃)-COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(b) at C3:** Neighbors are `H(a)` (1H), the `-CH₂-` of the ethyl group (2H), and the `-CH₃` at C3 (3H). This creates a **dtq**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in the structure adjacent to a `-CH-` and two different `-CH₂-` groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This molecule does not have a proton that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₃CH₂-CH(b)(C₂H₅)-CH(a)(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(b) at C3:** Neighbors are `H(a)` (1H), the `-CH₂-` from the main chain at C4 (2H), and the `-CH₂-` of the ethyl group at C3 (2H). This creates a **dtt**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in the structure adjacent to a `-CH-`, a `-CH₂-`, and a `-CH₃` group to create a `dtq`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This molecule does not have a proton that would produce a `dtq` signal.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nOnly **structure A (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)** has protons in environments that would produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets AND a doublet of triplets of triplets. Therefore, this is the correct identity of the unknown compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, consistent with a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the class of compound but doesn't differentiate between the choices.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns described.\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four structures are saturated, so this is consistent with all options.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This means a single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A set of one proton (n=1), leading to a doublet (1+1=2).\n    *   A set of two protons (n=2), leading to a triplet (2+1=3).\n    *   A set of three protons (n=3), leading to a quartet (3+1=4).\n    *   The total number of neighboring protons for this signal is 1 + 2 + 3 = **6**.\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means a different single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A set of one proton (n=1), leading to a doublet (1+1=2).\n    *   A set of two protons (n=2), leading to a triplet (2+1=3).\n    *   Another set of two protons (n=2), leading to a triplet (2+1=3).\n    *   The total number of neighboring protons for this signal is 1 + 2 + 2 = **5**.\n\nOur task is to find the structure that has two specific methine (C-H) protons with exactly these environments.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Candidate Structure\n\nWe will now analyze the protons on the chiral centers (methine protons) for each option. We will assume the n+1 rule applies and that the COOH proton does not couple.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`CH₃(a)-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(CH₃(e))-CH(d)(CH₃(f))-COOH`\n*   **H(c):** This proton is coupled to the `CH₂(b)` group (2 protons, gives a triplet), the `H(d)` proton (1 proton, gives a doublet), and the `CH₃(e)` group (3 protons, gives a quartet). Total neighbors = 2+1+3 = 6. The pattern is a **tdq** (or **dtq**). This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **H(d):** This proton is coupled to the `H(c)` proton (1 proton, gives a doublet) and the `CH₃(f)` group (3 protons, gives a quartet). Total neighbors = 1+3 = 4. The pattern is a **dq**. This does not match the `dtt` signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure A is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`CH₃(a)-CH(b)(CH₃(e))-CH(c)(CH₃(f))-CH₂(d)-COOH`\n*   **H(b):** Coupled to `CH₃(a)` (3H, quartet), `H(c)` (1H, doublet), and `CH₃(e)` (3H, quartet). Total neighbors = 3+1+3 = 7. The pattern is a **qdq**. This matches neither required signal.\n*   **H(c):** Coupled to `H(b)` (1H, doublet), `CH₂(d)` (2H, triplet), and `CH₃(f)` (3H, quartet). Total neighbors = 1+2+3 = 6. The pattern is a **dtq**. This matches one signal, but the other signal (`qdq`) is wrong.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure D is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nLet Et = CH₂CH₃.\n`CH₃(a)-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(Et)-CH(d)(Et)-COOH`\n*   **H(c):** Coupled to `CH₂(b)` (2H, triplet), `H(d)` (1H, doublet), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). Total neighbors = 2+1+2 = 5. The pattern is a **tdt** (or **dtt**). This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **H(d):** Coupled to `H(c)` (1H, doublet) and the `CH₂` of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). Total neighbors = 1+2 = 3. The pattern is a **dt**. This does not match the `dtq` signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure C is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nThis formula is best interpreted as the structure for 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid.\nLet Et = CH₂CH₃.\n`CH₃(a)-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH₂(d)-COOH`\nLet's analyze the methine protons, H(b) and H(c).\n*   **H(b) (on C4):** This proton is coupled to the `CH₃(a)` group (3 protons, gives a quartet), the `H(c)` proton (1 proton, gives a doublet), and the `CH₂` of its own ethyl group (2 protons, gives a triplet). Total neighbors = 3+1+2 = 6. The pattern is a **qdt** (which is the same as a **dtq**). **This is a match.**\n*   **H(c) (on C3):** This proton is coupled to the `H(b)` proton (1 proton, gives a doublet), the `CH₂(d)` group (2 protons, gives a triplet), and the `CH₂` of its own ethyl group (2 protons, gives a triplet). Total neighbors = 1+2+2 = 5. The pattern is a **dtt**. **This is also a match.**\n\n**Conclusion:** Structure B is the only one that has a proton environment corresponding to a `dtq` signal and another proton environment corresponding to a `dtt` signal.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Compound B is 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid.\n*   Its FTIR spectrum would show broad O-H and strong C=O absorptions, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   Its ¹H NMR spectrum would not show vinyl protons.\n*   Its ¹H NMR spectrum would contain a proton (H at C4) with a `dtq` splitting pattern.\n*   Its ¹H NMR spectrum would contain a proton (H at C3) with a `dtt` splitting pattern.\nAll pieces of experimental data point to this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer, where the broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the options. The final identification must come from the ¹H NMR data.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in deciphering the complex splitting patterns described. A signal's multiplicity is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons according to the n+1 rule. For complex splitting, we consider each group of neighboring protons separately.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This tells us that the proton responsible for this signal is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1)\n    *   Two neighboring protons (giving the **t**riplet, n=2)\n    *   Three neighboring protons (giving the **q**uartet, n=3)\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    This tells us that the proton responsible for this signal is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1)\n    *   Two neighboring protons (giving the first **t**riplet, n=2)\n    *   Another, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (giving the second **t**riplet, n=2)\n\nNow, we must examine the structure of each option to see which one contains protons with the required sets of neighbors. The most likely candidates for such complex splitting are the methine protons (CH) at the chiral centers.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's determine the IUPAC name for each formula to avoid ambiguity and analyze its structure. The main chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the carboxyl group.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   `CH₃(g)CH₂(f)-CH(e)(CH₃)d-CH(b)(CH₃)c-COOH(a)`\n    *   Proton **H_e** (at C3) is coupled to H_b (1H), H_f (2H), and H_d (3H). This would give a **dqt**, matching one of the signals.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to sets of 1H, 2H, and 2H neighbors to give a **dtt**. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   `(CH₃)₂CH(c)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₂(a)-COOH`\n    *   Proton **H_b** (at C3) is coupled to H_a (2H), H_c (1H), and the methyl protons on C3 (3H). This gives a **tqd** (or **dtq**), matching one signal.\n    *   Again, there is no proton that would give a **dtt**. So, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H), the CH₂ of the ethyl at C3 (2H), and the CH₂ of the main chain at C4 (2H). This gives a **dtt**, matching one signal.\n    *   However, no proton has the correct combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) to produce a **dtq**. The methylene protons in the ethyl and pentyl chains will give `ddq` patterns. So, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n    Let's parse this formula: `[CH₃]-[CH(C₂H₅)]-[CH(C₂H₅)]-[CH₂COOH]`\n    The longest chain containing the COOH group makes this a hexanoic acid derivative. Its name is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n    Let's draw and label the key protons on the backbone:\n    \n          CH₃(a)    Et(f)\n          |         |\n    CH₃CH₂(c)-CH(b) - CH(e) - CH₂(d) - COOH\n\n    *   **Analyze proton H_b (at C4):**\n        *   It is coupled to the single proton **H_e** (1H) → doublet.\n        *   It is coupled to the methylene protons **H_c** (2H) → triplet.\n        *   It is coupled to the methyl protons **H_a** (3H) → quartet.\n        *   The resulting signal for H_b is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal description.\n\n    *   **Analyze proton H_e (at C3):**\n        *   It is coupled to the single proton **H_b** (1H) → doublet.\n        *   It is coupled to the methylene protons **H_d** (2H) → triplet.\n        *   It is coupled to the methylene protons of its ethyl group, **H_f** (2H) → triplet.\n        *   The resulting signal for H_e is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal description.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStructure D, which is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, is the only compound that has protons matching both of the complex splitting patterns observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, where the broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group present but does not differentiate between the choices.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated carboxylic acids, consistent with this information.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a single proton is coupled to three different neighboring groups of protons:\n        *   A group with 1 proton (giving the doublet, `d`).\n        *   A group with 2 protons (giving the triplet, `t`).\n        *   A group with 3 protons (giving the quartet, `q`).\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different single proton is coupled to three different neighboring groups of protons:\n        *   A group with 1 proton (giving the doublet, `d`).\n        *   A group with 2 protons (giving the first triplet, `t`).\n        *   Another group with 2 protons (giving the second triplet, `t`).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Structure Based on the Splitting Patterns:**\n    The key to solving this problem is to find a structure that contains one proton environment matching the `dtq` pattern and another proton environment matching the `dtt` pattern. Let's analyze the structures derived from the provided condensed formulas. Note that these formulas can be ambiguous, so we will deduce the most plausible structures. The letter options (A, B, C, D) correspond to the order in the question.\n\n    *   **Structure A: `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH`**\n        This likely represents `3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid`, but has the wrong atom count. If we assume a typo and it represents a C8 acid like `3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid` (`CH3CH2-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-CH2-COOH`), we can analyze its methine (`CH`) protons. Each methine proton is coupled to another methine (1H, `d`), a methylene (2H, `t`), and a methyl (3H, `q`). Both methine protons would be a `dtq`. This structure does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n    *   **Structure B: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\n        This likely represents a molecule with a `-CH2COOH` end and ethyl branches. The most direct interpretation is `3,4-diethylhexanoic acid` (C10, too large). If we analyze the proton topology, we find two methine protons, each coupled to another methine (1H, `d`) and two different methylene groups (2H, `t` and 2H, `t`). This structure would exhibit two `dtt` signals, but no `dtq` signal.\n\n    *   **Structure C: `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH`**\n        This most likely represents `2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid` (C7). Assuming a typo for a C8 acid like `2,3-dimethylhexanoic acid` (`CH3CH2CH2-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-COOH`), let's analyze the methine protons.\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H, `d`), the `CH2` group at C4 (2H, `t`), and its own methyl branch (3H, `q`). This proton would be a **`dtq`**.\n        *   However, this structure lacks a proton coupled to one `CH` and two `CH2` groups, so it would not show a `dtt` signal.\n\n    *   **Structure D: `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH`**\n        This formula most plausibly represents **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**. Let's draw it and number the carbons, starting from the carboxyl group.\n        ```\n              Et (branch on C3)\n               |\n        CH3(5)-CH2(4)-CH(3)-CH(2)-COOH\n                             |\n                            Et (branch on C2)\n        ```\n        Let's analyze the methine (`CH`) protons at positions 2 and 3.\n        *   **Proton at C3 (H3):** This proton is coupled to:\n            1.  The proton at C2 (a `CH` group, 1H) -> `doublet (d)`\n            2.  The protons on C4 (a `CH2` group, 2H) -> `triplet (t)`\n            3.  The protons on the `CH2` of its own ethyl branch (a `CH2` group, 2H) -> `triplet (t)`\n            Therefore, the signal for H3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the signals described in the problem.\n\n        *   **Proton at C2 (H2):** This proton is coupled to:\n            1.  The proton at C3 (a `CH` group, 1H) -> `doublet (d)`\n            2.  The protons on the `CH2` of its ethyl branch (a `CH2` group, 2H) -> `triplet (t)`\n            The signal for H2 is a `doublet of triplets (dt)`.\n\n        *   Now, let's search for the `dtq` signal. A `dtq` signal requires a proton coupled to a 1H, a 2H, and a 3H group. In this molecule, there are no methine protons coupled to a methyl group. Let's check the methylene protons. For instance, a proton on the `CH2` at C4 is coupled to H3 (1H, `d`), the `CH3` at C5 (3H, `q`), and its geminal partner (1H, `d`). This results in a `qdd` (quartet of doublet of doublets), not a `dtq`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Of the four options, only structure D (`2,3-diethylpentanoic acid`) possesses the necessary arrangement of neighboring protons to produce a **`dtt`** signal for one of its methine protons. While finding the `dtq` is not straightforward from a simple analysis (it may arise from a more complex interaction or there could be a slight error in the problem's description), the presence of the very specific `dtt` pattern is a strong and unambiguous indicator for structure D. None of the other structures can produce a `dtt` signal. Therefore, this must be the correct compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding. The broadness is a key characteristic.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This frequency is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), so this information is consistent with all candidates but doesn't differentiate between them.\n\n### **2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe most crucial information comes from the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the signals in the 1H NMR spectrum. The splitting of a proton's signal is determined by its non-equivalent neighboring protons (the n+1 rule). When a proton is coupled to multiple, different groups of protons, its signal becomes a multiplet of multiplets.\n\nWe are given two specific, complex signals:\n1.  **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n2.  **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nLet's break down what these patterns mean in terms of neighboring protons:\n*   **dtq (doublet of triplets of quartets):** The proton giving this signal must be adjacent to three different groups of protons:\n    *   A group with **1** proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A group with **2** equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   A group with **3** equivalent protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n    *   **Total neighbors:** 1H, 2H, and 3H.\n*   **dtt (doublet of triplets of triplets):** The proton giving this signal must be adjacent to three different groups of protons:\n    *   A group with **1** proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A group with **2** equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   Another, different group with **2** equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   **Total neighbors:** 1H, 2H, and 2H.\n\nThe correct compound must have protons in environments that match **both** of these descriptions.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nFirst, let's clarify the structures from the condensed formulas, assuming they represent valid chain structures.\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2CH(C2H5)CH(C2H5)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   **B) CH3CH(C2H5)CH(C2H5)CH2COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   **C) CH3CH2CH(CH3)CH(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   **D) CH3CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH2COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n\nNow, let's analyze the methine (CH) protons in each structure, as they are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n*(Note: For this analysis, we will make a common simplification that the two protons of a CH₂ group in an ethyl or propyl chain are equivalent, even if they are technically diastereotopic due to nearby chiral centers. The observation of clean multiplets suggests this is a valid approximation here.)*\n\n---\n#### **Analysis of C: 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3-CH2-CH(c)-CH(b)-COOH`\n         `|      |`\n         `CH3    CH3`\n*   **Proton H(b):** Is next to H(c) (1H) and a CH₃ group (3H). Its neighbors are (1H, 3H), so its signal would be a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This doesn't match.\n*   **Proton H(c):** Is next to H(b) (1H), a CH₂ group (2H), and a CH₃ group (3H). Its neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H), so its signal would be a **dtq**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** This molecule can produce a `dtq`, but it has no proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) to produce a `dtt`. So, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n#### **Analysis of D: 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3-CH(e)-CH(d)-CH2-COOH`\n     `|      |`\n     `CH3    CH3`\n*   **Proton H(d):** Is next to H(e) (1H), a CH₂ group (2H), and a CH₃ group (3H). Its neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H), so its signal would be a **dtq**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **Proton H(e):** Is next to H(d) (1H) and two different CH₃ groups (3H + 3H = 6H). Its neighbors are (1H, 6H), so its signal would be a **doublet of septets (d-septet)**. This does not match.\n*   **Conclusion for D:** This molecule can produce a `dtq`, but it cannot produce a `dtt`. So, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n#### **Analysis of A: 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3-CH2-CH(c)-CH(b)-COOH`\n         `|      |`\n         `C2H5   C2H5`\nThe methine protons H(b) and H(c) are surrounded by other protons on chiral carbons and diastereotopic CH₂ groups. This leads to very complex splitting (e.g., doublet of doublets of doublets), not the clean `dtq` or `dtt` patterns described. So, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n#### **Analysis of B: 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3-CH(b)(C2H5)-CH(e)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`\nThe key protons are the two methines, H(b) on C4 and H(e) on C3.\n*   **Proton H(b) (on C4):** Let's count its neighbors.\n    *   The methine proton H(e) on C3 (1H).\n    *   The protons on the terminal CH₃ group (3H).\n    *   The protons on the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2H).\n    *   The neighbors are **(1H, 2H, 3H)**. This proton's signal will be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This is a perfect match for the first signal.\n\n*   **Proton H(e) (on C3):** Let's count its neighbors.\n    *   The methine proton H(b) on C4 (1H).\n    *   The protons on the main chain's CH₂ group at C2 (2H).\n    *   The protons on the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H).\n    *   The neighbors are **(1H, 2H, 2H)**. This proton's signal will be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This is a perfect match for the second signal.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nStructure B, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is the only candidate that has protons matching both of the specific splitting patterns (`dtq` and `dtt`) described in the 1H NMR data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\n**1. Deconstruct the Provided Information**\n\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules, consistent with this data.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** For a signal to have this splitting pattern, the corresponding proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   Doublet (d) implies coupling to one neighboring proton (a CH group).\n        *   Triplet (t) implies coupling to two neighboring protons (a CH₂ group).\n        *   Quartet (q) implies coupling to three neighboring protons (a CH₃ group).\n        *   Therefore, the proton responsible for the `dtq` signal must be adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group.\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** For a signal to have this splitting pattern, the corresponding proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   Doublet (d) implies coupling to one neighboring proton (a CH group).\n        *   Triplet (t) implies coupling to two neighboring protons (a CH₂ group).\n        *   Another Triplet (t) implies coupling to another, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (a second, different CH₂ group).\n        *   Therefore, the proton responsible for the `dtt` signal must be adjacent to a CH group and two non-equivalent CH₂ groups.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Structures**\n\nFirst, let's interpret the condensed formulas into structural drawings and systematic (IUPAC) names.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH** is **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    ```\n          CH₃ CH₃\n          |   |\n    CH₃ - CH--CH--CH₂--COOH\n     5    4   3    2    1\n    ```\n    Let's check for the required signals:\n    *   **H at C3**: Is coupled to H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) would indeed produce a **dtq**.\n    *   **dtt?**: Is there any proton coupled to one CH and two different CH₂ groups? No. Therefore, structure C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH** is **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    ```\n          CH₃ CH₃\n          |   |\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH--CH--COOH\n     5   4   3   2   1\n    ```\n    Let's check for the required signals:\n    *   **H at C3**: Is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This combination (1H, 2H, 3H) would produce a **dtq**.\n    *   **dtt?**: Is there any proton coupled to one CH and two different CH₂ groups? No. Therefore, structure D is incorrect.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH** is **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    ```\n          Et  Et\n          |   |\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH--CH--COOH\n     5   4   3   2   1\n    ```\n    Let's check for the required signals:\n    *   **H at C3**: Is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H). Since the molecule is chiral, these two CH₂ groups are non-equivalent. This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) would produce a **dtt**.\n    *   **dtq?**: Is there any proton coupled to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group? No. All methine (CH) and methylene (CH₂) protons lack a necessary neighbor type to form a `dtq`. For example, the protons on the CH₂ group at C4 are coupled to H at C3 (1H), the terminal CH₃ group (3H), and the geminal proton on C4. This gives a complex multiplet, but not a `dtq`. Therefore, structure A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH** can be interpreted as **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**. Let's draw it and analyze.\n    ```\n                 CH₃(on C4)\n                 |\n    CH₃-CH₂ -- CH -- CH -- CH₂ -- COOH\n     6   5      4      3      2      1\n                       |\n                       CH₂CH₃(on C3)\n    ```\n    Let's check this structure for the required signals:\n    *   **H at C4**: This proton is coupled to H at C3 (1H), the CH₂ at C5 (2H), and the CH₃ on C4 (3H). This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) will produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n    *   **H at C3**: This proton is coupled to H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H). Due to the chiral centers (C3 and C4), these two CH₂ groups are non-equivalent. This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStructure B is the only candidate that has protons in the correct electronic environments to produce both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for a carboxylic acid dimer.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum provides the most crucial information for determining the specific structure.\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This means there are no protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, so they are all consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This indicates a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving a doublet, `d`).\n    *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (giving a triplet, `t`).\n    *   Three equivalent neighboring protons (giving a quartet, `q`).\n    For this to occur, a `CH` group must be adjacent to a `CH` group, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group.\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This indicates a different single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving a doublet, `d`).\n    *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (giving one triplet, `t`).\n    *   A second group of two equivalent neighboring protons (giving another triplet, `t`).\n    For this to occur, a `CH` group must be adjacent to a `CH` group and two non-equivalent `CH₂` groups.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Proposed Structure\n\nLet's evaluate each candidate molecule to see if its structure can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. We will number the carbon chain starting from the `COOH` as C1.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n*   The proton on C3 (H-3) is adjacent to H-2 (1H), the C4-H₂ group (2H), and the C3-methyl group (3H). Its signal would be a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n*   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is adjacent to a `CH` group and two `CH₂` groups. Therefore, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`(CH₃)₂CH(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   The proton on C3 (H-3) is adjacent to H-4 (1H), the C2-H₂ group (2H), and the C3-methyl group (3H). Its signal would be a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n*   Like structure A, there is no proton that could produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH(4)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   Let's analyze the proton on C3 (H-3). It is adjacent to H-4 (1H), the C2-H₂ group (2H), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl substituent (2H). Its signal would be split into a doublet by H-4, a triplet by the C2-H₂ group, and another triplet by the ethyl `CH₂`. This results in a **dtt** signal. This matches Signal 2.\n*   Now let's analyze the proton on C4 (H-4). It is adjacent to H-3 (1H), the C5-H₃ methyl group (3H), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl substituent (2H). Its signal would be split into a doublet by H-3, a quartet by the C5-H₃ group, and a triplet by the ethyl `CH₂`. This results in a **dqt** (doublet of quartets of triplets) signal. A `dqt` is a highly complex multiplet with 24 lines, just like a `dtq`, and is the only possible source for this type of complex splitting in the given options that also has a `dtt`. It is very plausible that `dqt` is reported as `dtq`.\n*   Since this structure produces both a `dtt` and a `dqt` (reported as `dtq`), it matches all the NMR data.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₂CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n*   The proton on C3 (H-3) is adjacent to H-2 (1H), the C4-H₂ group (2H), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl substituent (2H). Its signal would be a **dtt**. This matches Signal 2.\n*   However, there is no proton in this structure that is adjacent to a `CH`, a `CH₂`, and a `CH₃` group. Therefore, it cannot produce the required `dtq` signal.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nOnly structure C, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, can give rise to both a `dtt` signal (from H-3) and a highly complex `dqt` signal (from H-4) which is reported as a `dtq`. Therefore, compound C is the unknown product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\n**1. Deconstruction of the problem**\nThe user has provided FTIR and ¹H NMR data for an unknown compound and a list of four possible structures. I need to use this spectroscopic information to identify the correct structure.\n\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   No signals corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four structures.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** According to the n+1 rule, this means the proton generating this signal is coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a doublet (d) splitting.\n        *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a triplet (t) splitting.\n        *   Three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), causing a quartet (q) splitting.\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means the proton generating this signal is coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a doublet (d) splitting.\n        *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a triplet (t) splitting.\n        *   Another, different set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a second triplet (t) splitting.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Candidate Structures**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to find the single structure that contains protons that would give rise to *both* a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal. I will analyze the most complex protons in each structure, which are the methine protons (`-CH-`) on the carbon chain.\n\n*   **Structure A: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n    This is 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid, or `(CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂COOH`. Let's analyze the proton on carbon-3, H(c) in `-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH₂(e)-`.\n    *   H(c) is coupled to: the H on carbon-4 (1H, doublet), the `CH₂` group at carbon-2 (2H, triplet), and the methyl group at carbon-3 (3H, quartet).\n    *   This gives a `dtq` signal. However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to one proton, a two-proton group, and another two-proton group. Thus, there is no `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **Structure B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n    This is 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid, `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`. Let's analyze the proton on carbon-3, H(c) in `...-CH(c)(C₂H₅)-CH(f)...`.\n    *   H(c) is coupled to: the H on carbon-2 (1H, doublet), the `CH₂` of the ethyl group at the end of the chain (2H, triplet), and the `CH₂` of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H, triplet).\n    *   This gives a `dtt` signal. However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbours. The methine proton on C2 would be a doublet of triplets. Methylene protons in the ethyl groups would be complex multiplets (likely ddq's), but not a clean `dtq`.\n\n*   **Structure D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n    This is 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid, `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. Let's analyze the proton on carbon-3, H(c) in `...-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(e)...`.\n    *   H(c) is coupled to: the H on carbon-2 (1H, doublet), the `CH₂` group of the terminal ethyl group (2H, triplet), and the methyl group substituent (3H, quartet).\n    *   This gives a `dtq` signal. However, similar to structure A, there is no environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **Structure C: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n    This corresponds to the structure **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`. Let's number the main chain starting from the carboxyl carbon as C1.\n    Structure:\n```\n           Et (ethyl on C3)\n           |\nHOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₅(from formula string)\n```\n    No, this naming is incorrect. Let's interpret the line formula `CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH` correctly.\n    It describes a pentanoic acid backbone with ethyl groups on carbons 3 and 4: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₃`.\n    Let's analyze the methine protons on carbons 3 and 4 of **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`\n\n    *   **Proton at C4 (H-4):**\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₃` group at C5 (3H, gives a **quartet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the methine proton at C3 (1H, gives a **doublet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2H, gives a **triplet**).\n        *   Combining these, the signal for H-4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n\n    *   **Proton at C3 (H-3):**\n        *   It is adjacent to the methine proton at C4 (1H, gives a **doublet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` group at C2 (2H, gives a **triplet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H, gives another **triplet**).\n        *   Combining these, the signal for H-3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\nStructure C is the only candidate that possesses the necessary structural features to produce both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the choices.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n    *   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This tells us there are no protons attached to sp² carbons of a C=C double bond. This is consistent with all four proposed structures, as none contain C=C double bonds.\n    *   **\"One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\"**: According to the n+1 rule, this means a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **Doublet (d)**: Coupled to 1 adjacent proton (a CH group).\n        *   **Triplet (t)**: Coupled to 2 adjacent protons (a CH₂ group).\n        *   **Quartet (q)**: Coupled to 3 adjacent protons (a CH₃ group).\n    *   **\"a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\"**: This means a different single proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **Doublet (d)**: Coupled to 1 adjacent proton (a CH group).\n        *   **Triplet (t)**: Coupled to 2 adjacent protons (a CH₂ group).\n        *   **Triplet (t)**: Coupled to another, non-equivalent set of 2 adjacent protons (another CH₂ group).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Proposed Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the key protons (the CH methine protons) in each structure. We will number the carbon chains starting from the COOH group as C1.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet), H's at C2 (2H, triplet), and its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet). This gives a **tdq** (or **dtq**). This matches one of the signals.\n    *   **H at C4**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet), its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet), and the terminal CH₃ at C5 (3H, quartet). This gives a **dqq**. This does not match the `dtt` signal. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(2)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **H at C2**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet). This gives a **dq**.\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet), and the CH₂ group at C4 (2H, triplet). This gives a **dqt**. Neither signal matches the required `dtq` and `dtt` pair. So, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n    The condensed formula `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` corresponds to 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid when the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group is identified.\n    Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    Let's analyze the key methine protons:\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet), H's at C2 (2H, triplet), and the H's on the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets). This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   **H at C4**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet), H's at C5 (2H, triplet), and the H's of its methyl group (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets). This matches the other required signal.\n    *   Since this structure produces both the `dtq` and the `dtt` signals, it is the correct answer.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(2)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), H's at C4 (2H, triplet), and the H's of its ethyl group's CH₂ (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt**. This matches one signal.\n    *   Are there any other protons that would give a `dtq`? The other methine proton is at C2. H at C2 is coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet), giving a `dt`. There are no protons coupled to a CH, a CH₂, *and* a CH₃ group. Therefore, this structure cannot produce a `dtq` signal. So, D is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion**\n    Only the structure corresponding to option C, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, gives rise to both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum, matching the experimental data perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). The broadness is caused by intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid group, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group class but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n### **2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) described in the 1H NMR data.\n\n*   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This confirms there are no C=C double bonds in the molecule, which is consistent with all four structures.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This pattern arises when a single proton (or a set of equivalent protons) is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet (1+1=2).\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet (2+1=3).\n    *   A set of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet (3+1=4).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton with a {1H, 2H, 3H} set of neighbors. The order (dtq vs. tqd vs. qdt, etc.) depends on the relative sizes of the coupling constants (J-values), but the set of neighbors must be the same.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), giving a **d**oublet.\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), giving a **t**riplet.\n    *   Another, non-equivalent set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), giving another **t**riplet.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton with a {1H, 2H, 2H} set of neighbors.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the local environment of the methine (CH) protons in each structure to see if they match the required splitting patterns.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: Coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the -CH₂- of the ethyl group (2H), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H). This is a {1H, 2H, 3H} environment, which would produce a **dtq** (or tqd/qdt). This matches one signal.\n*   H at C2: Coupled to the H at C3 (1H), the -CH₃ on C2 (3H), and the -COOH proton (1H). This is a {1H, 3H, 1H} environment, which would produce a doublet of quartets of doublets (dqd). This does not match the `dtt` pattern.\n*   **Result:** Incorrect. Has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**B) (CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: Coupled to the H at C4 (1H), the -CH₂- group (2H), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H). This is a {1H, 2H, 3H} environment, producing a **dtq**. This matches one signal.\n*   H at C4: Coupled to the H at C3 (1H) and the two -CH₃ groups of the isopropyl tail (6H). This is a {1H, 6H} environment, producing a doublet of septets. This does not match the `dtt` pattern.\n*   **Result:** Incorrect. Has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: Coupled to H at C2 (1H), the -CH₂- of the C4-ethyl group (2H), and the -CH₂- of its own C3-ethyl group (2H). This is a {1H, 2H, 2H} environment, which would produce a **dtt**. This matches one signal.\n*   H at C2: Coupled to H at C3 (1H), the -CH₂- of its own C2-ethyl group (2H), and the -COOH proton (1H). This is a {1H, 2H, 1H} environment, which would produce a doublet of triplets of doublets (dtd). This does not match the `dtq` pattern.\n*   **Result:** Incorrect. Has a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.\n\n**C) CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH**\nLet's analyze the structure based on the provided formula, assuming a backbone of `CH3-CH-CH-CH2-COOH`. Let's label the methine protons H_a and H_b.\n`CH₃ - CH_a(C₂H₅) - CH_b(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - COOH`\n\n*   **Proton H_a**: Let's identify its neighbors.\n    *   On the adjacent methyl group: 3 protons.\n    *   The adjacent methine proton: H_b (1 proton).\n    *   The methylene (-CH₂-) of the ethyl group attached to its carbon: 2 protons.\n    *   The set of neighbors is **{3H, 1H, 2H}**. This will produce a **quartet of doublets of triplets (qdt)**, which is a permutation of `dtq`. **This is a match.**\n\n*   **Proton H_b**: Let's identify its neighbors.\n    *   The adjacent methine proton: H_a (1 proton).\n    *   The methylene (-CH₂-) next to the carboxylic acid: 2 protons.\n    *   The methylene (-CH₂-) of the ethyl group attached to its carbon: 2 protons.\n    *   The set of neighbors is **{1H, 2H, 2H}**. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. **This is a match.**\n\n*   **Result:** Correct. This structure is the only one that possesses one proton with a {1H, 2H, 3H} neighborhood (`dtq`) and a different proton with a {1H, 2H, 2H} neighborhood (`dtt`).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the 1H NMR splitting patterns, compound C is the only candidate that matches the experimental data.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. This broad peak typically overlaps with the C-H stretching absorptions.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible structures are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent with all options but does not distinguish between them.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **\"No vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules, consistent with this information.\n    *   **Key Information**: The spectrum contains two particularly complex and revealing signals: a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq) and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt). These multiplicities arise from a proton's signal being split by neighboring, non-equivalent protons. The N+1 rule applies for each group of equivalent neighboring protons.\n        *   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a single proton (1H, gives a doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (2H, gives a triplet), and a group of three equivalent protons (3H, gives a quartet).\n        *   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a single proton (1H, gives a doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (2H, gives a triplet), and another distinct group of two equivalent protons (2H, gives another triplet).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Potential Structure against the NMR Data:**\n    Let's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons in each molecule. We will focus on the most complex signals, which come from the CH (methine) protons on the carbon backbone. Note that in molecules with chiral centers, adjacent CH₂ protons are often diastereotopic (non-equivalent), which can complicate splitting patterns (e.g., turning an expected triplet into a doublet of doublets). However, the given names (`dtq`, `dtt`) suggest that we can, at a first-order approximation, treat these as equivalent protons for splitting purposes, or that there is \"accidental equivalence\" where the coupling constants are very similar.\n\n    Let's write out the structures assuming linear depiction and standard IUPAC naming conventions:\n\n    *   **A) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Me)-CH(3)(Me)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C3: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet) and the two protons at C2 (2H, triplet). Expected signal: `dt`.\n        *   Proton at C4: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the three protons at C5 (3H, quartet). Expected signal: `dq`.\n        *   This molecule does not produce a `dtt` or `dtq`.\n\n    *   **B) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-Diethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C3: Coupled to protons at C2 (2H, `t`), proton at C4 (1H, `d`), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, `t`). Expected signal: `tdt`.\n        *   Proton at C4: Coupled to proton at C3 (1H, `d`), protons at C5 (3H, `q`), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, `t`). Expected signal: `dqt` (doublet of quartets of triplets). This is close to `dtq`, just different order.\n        *   This molecule does not produce a `dtt`. It has a `tdt` and a `dqt`.\n\n    *   **C) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` -> 2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(2)(Me)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C2: Coupled only to H at C3 (1H, doublet). Expected signal: `d`.\n        *   Proton at C3: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet) and the two protons at C4 (2H, triplet). Expected signal: `dt`.\n        *   This molecule does not produce a `dtt` or `dtq`.\n\n    *   **D) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` -> 2,3-Diethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)(Et)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Let's analyze the proton at **C3**. It is adjacent to three different carbons bearing protons:\n            1.  C2, which has one proton (H at C2). This will split the C3-proton signal into a **doublet**.\n            2.  C4, which has two protons (the CH₂ group). These will split the C3-proton signal into a **triplet**.\n            3.  The first carbon of the ethyl group attached to C3, which is also a CH₂ group with two protons. These will also split the C3-proton signal into a **triplet**.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for the proton at C3 is expected to be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This is a perfect match for one of the signals described in the problem.\n        *   Now let's look for the **`dtq`** signal. While there isn't a proton with the exact neighboring environment (adjacent to 1H, 2H, and 3H groups) to produce a simple `dtq`, let's examine the protons in one of the diastereotopic CH₂ groups. For instance, the CH₂ protons at C4. They are adjacent to the CH proton at C3 and the CH₃ protons at C5. Due to being next to a chiral center (C3) and having geminal coupling to each other, their signal would be a **doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq)**. A `ddq` is a complex multiplet that can, under certain conditions or lower resolution, be mistaken for or reported as a `dtq`. Given the definitive and rare `dtt` signal is perfectly explained by this structure, it is the most plausible candidate. No other option can account for the `dtt` signal.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The structure of 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid (D) is the only one that can produce a `dtt` signal for the proton on C3. This provides extremely strong evidence for its identity. The other signal, `dtq`, is likely a slightly simplified description of one of the `ddq` signals present in the molecule.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nFirst, let's interpret the information from the characterization techniques.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group class but doesn't distinguish between the choices.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H). All four options are saturated molecules (containing only single bonds between carbons), so this is consistent with all of them.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises from a proton that is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons. According to the n+1 rule:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to 1 neighboring proton (n=1, multiplicity=1+1=2).\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to 2 neighboring protons (n=2, multiplicity=2+1=3).\n        *   **Quartet (q):** Coupling to 3 neighboring protons (n=3, multiplicity=3+1=4).\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises from a proton coupled to:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to 1 neighboring proton (n=1).\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to 2 neighboring protons (n=2).\n        *   **Another Triplet (t):** Coupling to a different group of 2 neighboring protons (n=2).\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in finding the single molecule that would produce *both* of these unique splitting patterns.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each of the proposed structures. The way the condensed formulas are written implies a sequential backbone.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`COOH - C(a)H(CH₃) - C(b)H(CH₃) - CH₂ - CH₃`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to H(a) (1H), the adjacent CH₂ (2H), and its own CH₃ (3H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Other protons:** None of the other protons (H(a), CH₂, CH₃) are coupled to one proton, a group of two, and another group of two protons. Therefore, this molecule does not have a dtt signal.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`COOH - CH₂ - C(a)H(CH₃) - C(b)H(CH₃) - CH₃`\n*   **Proton H(a):** It is coupled to H(b) (1H), the adjacent CH₂ (2H), and its own CH₃ (3H). This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one signal.\n*   **Other protons:** Proton H(b) is coupled to H(a) (1H) and two different CH₃ groups (3H and 3H). This would give a doublet of quartets of quartets (or a doublet of septets if the methyls were equivalent). No proton in this molecule would produce a dtt signal.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`COOH - C(a)H(C₂H₅) - C(b)H(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - CH₃`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to H(a) (1H), the adjacent CH₂ of the main chain (2H), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Other protons:** We now need to find a dtq signal (a proton coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors). Let's check the methylene protons. The -CH₂- protons in the main chain are coupled to H(b) (1H) and the terminal -CH₃ (3H). They would give a doublet of quartets (dq). The -CH₂- protons within the ethyl groups are also coupled to one methine proton (H(a) or H(b)) and one methyl group, which would also result in a dq. Therefore, this molecule does not have a dtq signal.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nLet's analyze the structure as written: a backbone of `C-C-C-C-COOH` with specified substituents.\n`CH₃(a) - C(b)H(C₂H₅) - C(e)H(C₂H₅) - C(h)H₂ - COOH`\n\n*   **Proton H(b):** This proton has three different neighboring groups of protons:\n    1.  The CH₃(a) group (3 protons) → creates a **quartet**.\n    2.  The methine proton H(e) (1 proton) → creates a **doublet**.\n    3.  The CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2 protons) → creates a **triplet**.\n    The resulting signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first signal.\n\n*   **Proton H(e):** This proton also has three different neighboring groups of protons:\n    1.  The methine proton H(b) (1 proton) → creates a **doublet**.\n    2.  The CH₂(h) group (2 protons) → creates a **triplet**.\n    3.  The CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2 protons) → creates another **triplet**.\n    The resulting signal for H(e) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second signal.\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nCompound C is the only candidate that possesses protons matching both of the complex splitting patterns described in the 1H NMR data. It has one proton environment that results in a dtq signal and a different proton environment that results in a dtt signal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\n**1.

All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group is correct for all candidates.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four structures are saturated alkanoic acids (except for the C=O), so this is consistent with all options.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a proton (let's call it H_A) is coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n        *   A group of two neighboring protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n        *   A group of three neighboring protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different proton (let's call it H_B) is coupled to three other distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n        *   A group of two neighboring protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n        *   Another group of two neighboring protons (n=2, gives another triplet).\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Structures**\n\nWe need to find the structure that has both a proton environment that would produce a `dtq` and another that would produce a `dtt`. Let's parse the formulas and draw the structures. The formulas are written in a way that implies a linear chain of the bracketed groups.\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    ```\n              CH3(e) CH3(f)\n              |      |\n    CH3(a)-CH2(b)-CH(c)--CH(d)-COOH\n    ```\n    *   `H(c)` neighbors: `CH2(b)` (2H, triplet), `H(d)` (1H, doublet), `CH3(e)` (3H, quartet). → This gives a **dtq**.\n    *   We need to find a `dtt`.

Therefore, it is the only structure that matches all the provided spectral data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n1.  **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the range of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration within a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The broadness is due to the strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. This peak often overlaps with the C-H stretching absorptions.\n2.  **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong, sharp peak in the range of 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. All four possible structures (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent with all options but doesn't differentiate between them.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n1.  **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to sp²-hybridized carbons of a C=C double bond. All four candidate molecules are saturated alkanoic acids, meaning they contain only single bonds (other than the C=O group), so this observation is also consistent with all options.\n2.  **Signal Multiplicity:** This is the key piece of information for differentiating the structures. The multiplicity (splitting pattern) of a proton's signal is determined by the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons (n) according to the n+1 rule. When a proton is coupled to multiple *different* groups of protons, its signal is split successively by each group, leading to complex patterns like a \"doublet of triplets.\"\n\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This indicates that the proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (1+1 = **2**, a doublet).\n        *   Two neighboring protons (2+1 = **3**, a triplet).\n        *   Three neighboring protons (3+1 = **4**, a quartet).\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates the proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (1+1 = **2**, a doublet).\n        *   Two neighboring protons (2+1 = **3**, a triplet).\n        *   Another, different group of two neighboring protons (2+1 = **3**, a triplet).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Structure of Each Option**\n\nWe need to find the structure that contains one proton matching the `dtq` environment and another proton matching the `dtt` environment. We will focus on the protons on the chiral centers (methine, -CH- groups) as they are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\nLet's parse the condensed formulas. We'll label the protons on the main chain's methine groups as **H**_x_ and **H**_y_.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH**\n*   Structure: `CH₃CH₂-CHx(C₂H₅)-CHy(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n*   **H**_y_: Coupled to **H**_x_ (1H, gives doublet), the two protons of its attached ethyl group's -CH₂- (2H, gives triplet), and the COOH proton (1H, which typically doesn't couple or exchanges, so we ignore it for splitting). So, **H**_y_ is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   **H**_x_: Coupled to **H**_y_ (1H, gives doublet), the two protons of the adjacent -CH₂- from the main chain (2H, gives triplet), and the two protons of its attached ethyl group's -CH₂- (2H, gives triplet). So, **H**_x_ is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   *Conclusion:* Structure A shows a `dtt` signal but not a `dtq` signal. This is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n*   Structure: `CH₃-CHx(C₂H₅)-CHy(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   **H**_x_: Coupled to the adjacent **H**_y_ (1H, gives doublet), the three protons of the adjacent CH₃ group (3H, gives quartet), and the two protons of its attached ethyl group's -CH₂- (2H, gives triplet). Thus, the signal for **H**_x_ is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n*   **H**_y_: Coupled to the adjacent **H**_x_ (1H, gives doublet), the two protons of the adjacent -CH₂-COOH group (2H, gives triplet), and the two protons of its attached ethyl group's -CH₂- (2H, gives triplet). Thus, the signal for **H**_y_ is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n*   *Conclusion:* Structure B contains protons that would give rise to both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. This is a perfect match.\n\n**C) CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n*   Structure: `CH₃-CHx(CH₃)-CHy(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   **H**_x_: Coupled to **H**_y_ (1H, gives doublet), the three protons of the main chain's terminal CH₃ group (3H, gives quartet), and the three protons of its attached CH₃ group (3H, gives quartet). This would be a **doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq)**.\n*   **H**_y_: Coupled to **H**_x_ (1H, gives doublet), the two protons of the adjacent -CH₂-COOH group (2H, gives triplet), and the three protons of its attached CH₃ group (3H, gives quartet). The signal for **H**_y_ is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   *Conclusion:* Structure C has a `dtq` signal but not a `dtt` signal. This is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH**\n*   Structure: `CH₃CH₂-CHx(CH₃)-CHy(CH₃)-COOH`\n*   **H**_x_: Coupled to **H**_y_ (1H, gives doublet), the two protons of the main chain's -CH₂- group (2H, gives triplet), and the three protons of its attached CH₃ group (3H, gives quartet). The signal for **H**_x_ is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   **H**_y_: Coupled to **H**_x_ (1H, gives doublet) and the three protons of its attached CH₃ group (3H, gives quartet). The signal for **H**_y_ is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n*   *Conclusion:* Structure D has a `dtq` signal but not a `dtt` signal. This is incorrect.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure **B** has the correct combination of neighboring protons to produce both a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** and a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded environment. The broadness is a hallmark of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns (multiplicities) described. We need a single molecule that exhibits *both* of the following signals:\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** A proton responsible for this signal must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1) to cause the doublet splitting (n+1 = 2).\n    *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2) to cause the triplet splitting (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3) to cause the quartet splitting (n+1 = 4).\n    *   In summary, this proton must be adjacent to a methine (-CH), a methylene (-CH₂), and a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** A proton responsible for this signal must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1) to cause the doublet splitting (n+1 = 2).\n    *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2) to cause the first triplet splitting (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Another set of two equivalent, but non-identical, neighboring protons (n=2) to cause the second triplet splitting (n+1 = 3).\n    *   In summary, this proton must be adjacent to a methine (-CH) and two different methylene (-CH₂) groups.\n\n### 3. Evaluating Each Candidate Structure\n\nLet's find the IUPAC names and analyze the expected splitting for the protons on the main chain of each molecule.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n      CH₃(g) CH₃(f)\n       |      |\nCH₃(e)-CH₂(d)-CH(c)--CH(b)--COOH(a)\n```\n*   **Proton H(c):** This proton is adjacent to:\n    *   Proton H(b) (a 1H group) → creates a doublet (d).\n    *   The CH₂(d) group (a 2H group) → creates a triplet (t).\n    *   The CH₃(f) group (a 3H group) → creates a quartet (q).\n*   Thus, proton H(c) gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first signal.\n*   However, let's look for a proton that could give a `dtt`. For a `dtt`, a proton needs to be adjacent to one -CH and two different -CH₂ groups. This molecule only contains one -CH₂ group in total (the `d` protons). Therefore, **molecule A cannot produce a `dtt` signal**.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n      CH₃   CH₃\n       |     |\nCH₃ -- CH -- CH -- CH₂ -- COOH\n  (5)  (4)   (3)   (2)    (1)\n```\n*   **Proton H(3):** Is adjacent to CH₂(2) (a 2H group, giving a triplet), H(4) (a 1H group, giving a doublet), and its own CH₃ group (a 3H group, giving a quartet). This results in a **triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq)**. This does not match the required `dtq` or `dtt`.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n          Et(c)\n           |\nCH₃-CH₂ --CH(b)--CH(a)--COOH\n      (e)   |      |\n            Et(d)  Et(g)\n```\n(where Et = -CH₂CH₃)\n*   **Proton H(b):** This proton is on C3 of the pentanoic acid chain and is adjacent to:\n    *   Proton H(a) at C2 (a 1H group) → creates a doublet (d).\n    *   The CH₂ group of the main chain at C4 (let's call it CH₂(e)) → creates a triplet (t).\n    *   The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on its own carbon (let's call it CH₂(d)) → creates another triplet (t).\n*   Thus, proton H(b) gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second signal.\n*   Now, let's look for a proton that could give a `dtq`. For a `dtq`, a proton must be adjacent to a -CH, a -CH₂, and a -CH₃. There are no protons in this molecule with that specific set of three different types of neighbours. For example, the protons on the methylene groups of the ethyl side chains (e.g., in `d` or `g`) are next to a methine (-CH) and a methyl (-CH₃). Because the molecule is chiral, these methylene protons are diastereotopic and will also split each other (geminal coupling). This leads to `ddq` (doublet of doublets of quartets) signals, not `dtq` signals. Therefore, **molecule C cannot produce a `dtq` signal under normal circumstances.**\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n*   This structure's key protons give signals like **triplet of doublets of triplets (tdt)** and **quartet of doublets of triplets (qdt)**. Neither of these match the required signals.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nThere is a contradiction in the problem statement. No single molecule from the list can unambiguously produce *both* a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal based on standard splitting rules.\n*   Molecule **A** perfectly explains the **`dtq`** signal.\n*   Molecule **C** perfectly explains the **`dtt`** signal.\n\nHowever, in a multiple-choice context, we must select the best possible fit. Let's reconsider molecule **C**. It unequivocally produces the `dtt` signal. It also produces other complex signals, such as multiple `ddq`s (doublet of doublets of quartets) from the diastereotopic methylene protons. It is conceivable, though a stretch, that one of these `ddq` signals could be mistaken for or reported as a `dtq`, perhaps due to poor resolution or accidental equivalence of coupling constants. Molecule A, on the other hand, has no structural feature that could possibly lead to a `dtt` signal. Therefore, Molecule C is the more plausible candidate as it explains one complex signal perfectly and possesses other complex signals that are structurally related to the second required signal.\n\nThe presence of the very specific **`dtt`** signal is strong evidence pointing towards the structure of **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Provided Data**\n    *   **FTIR:**\n        *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n        *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but doesn't differentiate between the options.\n\n    *   **1H NMR:**\n        *   \"no signals correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\": This tells me there are no `C=C` double bonds in the molecule. All four options are saturated, so this information is consistent with all of them.\n        *   \"One of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\": This is a very specific splitting pattern. For a signal (let's say for a proton `HA`) to be a `dtq`, it must be coupled to three distinct neighboring groups of protons:\n            *   One single proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n            *   A group of two equivalent protons, like a CH₂ group (n=2, gives a triplet).\n            *   A group of three equivalent protons, like a CH₃ group (n=3, gives a quartet).\n        *   \"a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\": This is another highly specific pattern. A proton exhibiting this splitting must be coupled to three different groups of neighbors:\n            *   One single proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n            *   A group of two equivalent protons, like a CH₂ group (n=2, gives a triplet).\n            *   *Another* group of two equivalent protons, like a second, different CH₂ group (n=2, gives another triplet).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Structures of the Options**\n\n    The core of the problem is to find which of the four molecules would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum. I'll analyze the expected splitting patterns for the key protons (the ones on the carbon backbone, not the simple terminal ones) for each molecule.\n\n    *   **Option C: `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH`**\n        This formula represents 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid: `(CH₃)₂CH–CH(CH₃)–CH₂–COOH`.\n        *   Let's look at the `CH` proton at position 4: `–CH(CH₃)₂`. It is coupled to the `CH` proton at C3 (1H) and two methyl groups (6H). This signal would be a doublet of septets. Not a `dtq` or `dtt`.\n        *   Let's look at the `CH` proton at position 3: `–CH(CH₃)–`. It's coupled to the `CH₂` (2H), the `CH` at C4 (1H), and its own methyl group (3H). This is too complex and involves coupling to diastereotopic CH₂ protons, but it's not a clean `dtt` or `dtq`.\n        *   **Conclusion for C:** Unlikely to produce the specified signals.\n\n    *   **Option D: `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH`**\n        This represents 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid: `CH₃CH₂–CH(CH₃)–CH(CH₃)–COOH`.\n        *   Let's analyze the proton on C3 (`–CH(CH₃)–`). Its neighbors are the proton on C2 (1H), its own methyl group (3H), and the `CH₂` of the ethyl group (2H). This proton is coupled to a 1H neighbor, a 2H neighbor group, and a 3H neighbor group. This would produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**! So this molecule has one of the required signals.\n        *   Now, we need to find a `dtt` signal in this molecule. A `dtt` requires a proton coupled to one 1H neighbor and two different 2H neighbors. This molecule only has one `CH₂` group. It's impossible for any proton in this molecule to be coupled to two different `CH₂` groups.\n        *   **Conclusion for D:** It has the `dtq` but lacks the `dtt`. Not the answer.\n\n    *   **Option B: `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH`**\n        This represents 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid: `CH₃CH₂–CH(C₂H₅)–CH(C₂H₅)–COOH`.\n        *   Let's analyze the proton on C3 (`–CH(C₂H₅)–`). Its neighbors are the proton on C2 (1H), the `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2H), and the `CH₂` group at the end of the pentanoic acid chain (2H). This proton is coupled to a 1H neighbor and two different 2H neighbors. This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**! This molecule has the other required signal.\n        *   Now, let's look for a `dtq`. This requires a proton coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors. Looking at the protons on C2 and C3, and even the protons within the `CH₂` groups, none have this specific set of neighbors. For example, the proton on C2 is coupled to the proton on C3 (1H) and the `CH₂` of its ethyl group (2H), giving a `dt`. The protons in the various `CH₂` groups would give `ddq` patterns (doublet of doublets of quartets).\n        *   **Conclusion for B:** It has the `dtt` but lacks the `dtq`. Not the answer.\n\n    *   **Option A: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\n        This notation is best interpreted as a chain built from these pieces, resulting in 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid: `CH₃–CH(C₂H₅)–CH(C₂H₅)–CH₂–COOH`.\n        Let's draw out the key protons on the backbone: `CH₃–CH(d)–CH(c)–CH₂(b)–COOH`. Each `CH` has an ethyl group attached.\n        *   Let's analyze the proton `H(c)`. Its neighbors are: the `CH₂(b)` group (2H), the `CH(d)` proton (1H), and the `CH₂` group from its own ethyl substituent (2H). Therefore, `H(c)` is coupled to one 1H neighbor and two different 2H neighbors. Its signal is a **dtt**.\n        *   Let's analyze the proton `H(d)`. Its neighbors are: the `CH(c)` proton (1H), the terminal `CH₃` group (3H), and the `CH₂` group from its own ethyl substituent (2H). Therefore, `H(d)` is coupled to a 1H neighbor, a 2H neighbor, and a 3H neighbor. Its signal is a **dtq**.\n        *   **Conclusion for A:** This molecule contains a proton that gives a `dtt` signal (`H(c)`) and a different proton that gives a `dtq` signal (`H(d)`). This matches the provided data perfectly.\n\n3.  **Final Decision**\n\n    Based on the detailed ¹H NMR splitting analysis, only the structure corresponding to option A, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, exhibits both a doublet of triplets of triplets and a doublet of triplets of quartets.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1.

The deciding information must come from the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### 2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds.

Structural Analysis of Each Option\n\nLet's determine the IUPAC name for each condensed formula and analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons on the main chain. We'll focus on 3-bond (vicinal) couplings.\n\n**A) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\n*   **Structure:** Interpreting the formula string from left to right as a continuous chain with branches gives `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`.\n*   **IUPAC Name:** To name this, we find the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group. That chain is 5 carbons long (the pentanoic acid chain is `HOOC-CH2-CH-CH-CH3`). There are ethyl substituents at positions 3 and 4. The name is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **Splitting Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   **H at C4:** This proton is coupled to three groups of vicinal protons:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → doublet (d)\n        2.  The protons of the terminal methyl group at C5 (3H) → quartet (q)\n        3.  The protons of the methylene (CH2) group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        This proton's signal will be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **H at C3:** This proton is also coupled to three groups of vicinal protons:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → doublet (d)\n        2.  The protons of the methylene group at C2 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        3.  The protons of the methylene (CH2) group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        This proton's signal will be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure A is an excellent candidate as it is predicted to have both of the complex signals observed in the spectrum.\n\n**B) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH`**\n*   **Structure:** `(CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n*   **IUPAC Name:** 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Splitting Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C4 (1H), CH2 at C2 (2H), and CH3 on C3 (3H). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   **H at C4:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H) and the two methyl groups (6H). This gives a **doublet of septets (d-sept)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This structure has a `dtq`, but it lacks the `dtt` signal. It is incorrect.\n\n**C) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH`**\n*   **Structure:** `CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n*   **IUPAC Name:** 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Splitting Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H) and its methyl group protons (3H). This gives a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n    *   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H) and CH2 at C4 (2H). This gives a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This structure does not have a `dtq` or a `dtt`. It is incorrect.\n\n**D) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH`**\n*   **Structure:** `CH3-CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH`\n*   **IUPAC Name:** 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Splitting Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H), CH2 at C4 (2H), and its ethyl CH2 (2H). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H) and its ethyl CH2 (2H). This gives a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This structure has a `dtt` but lacks the required `dtq` signal. It is incorrect.\n\n### Final Identification\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR splitting patterns, only the structure corresponding to option A, **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, will produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt). Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O). For a carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n\nThe FTIR data strongly suggest that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is correct for all candidates but does not help differentiate them.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThis is the critical part for distinguishing between the structures. We are given two key pieces of information about the splitting patterns (multiplicities) of two different proton signals:\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n*   Additionally, we know there are no vinyl hydrogens (protons on a C=C double bond), which is consistent with all four saturated structures.\n\nThe multiplicity of a signal for a proton (or a group of equivalent protons) is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons.\n*   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to 1 neighboring proton.\n*   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to 2 neighboring protons.\n*   **Quartet (q):** Indicates coupling to 3 neighboring protons.\n\nFor a complex signal like a `dtq`, a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n*   **dtq:** A proton coupled to one proton (d), two protons (t), and three protons (q). A likely local environment would be a CH proton that is adjacent to another CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n*   **dtt:** A proton coupled to one proton (d), two protons (t), and another group of two protons (t). A likely local environment would be a CH proton that is adjacent to another CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\nNow, let's analyze each candidate structure to see if it can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n**Parsing the Condensed Formulas:**\n\nLet's assume the formulas represent a linear chain of the specified segments.\n\n*   **Structure C: `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`**\n    This formula can be interpreted as a chain of segments: `CH₃-`, `-CH(C₂H₅)-`, `-CH(C₂H₅)-`, and `-CH₂-COOH`. Connecting these gives:\n    `CH₃ - CH(C₂H₅) - CH(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - COOH`\n\n    To determine the IUPAC name and analyze the structure, we must find the longest carbon chain containing the carboxyl group (C1).\n    `HOOC(1) — CH₂(2) — CH(3)(C₂H₅) — CH(4)(C₂H₅) — CH₃(start)`\n    If we follow the backbone as written, the chain is 5 carbons long (pentanoic acid). However, the ethyl group on C4 (`-CH₂CH₃`) extends the chain.\n    The longest chain is: `HOOC(1) — CH₂(2) — CH(3)(C₂H₅) — CH(4)(CH₃) — CH₂(5) — CH₃(6)`\n    This structure is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n\n    Let's analyze the protons on the main chain's chiral centers (C3 and C4):\n    1.  **Proton at C3 (H3):** This proton is adjacent to:\n        *   The `CH₂` group at C2 (2 protons) → gives a **triplet**.\n        *   The `CH` group at C4 (1 proton) → gives a **doublet**.\n        *   The `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2 protons) → gives a **triplet**.\n        Therefore, the signal for H3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n    2.  **Proton at C4 (H4):** This proton is adjacent to:\n        *   The `CH` group at C3 (1 proton) → gives a **doublet**.\n        *   The `CH₂` group at C5 (2 protons) → gives a **triplet**.\n        *   The `CH₃` substituent group on C4 (3 protons) → gives a **quartet**.\n        Therefore, the signal for H4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other observed signal.\n\n    Structure C is the only candidate that gives rise to *both* a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal.\n\n*   **Analysis of Other Options (Briefly):**\n\n    *   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):** The proton at C3 is adjacent to a CH (C2), a CH₂ (part of the ethyl group), and a CH₃. This gives a `dtq`. However, there is no proton in this molecule adjacent to one CH and two CH₂ groups, so it cannot produce a `dtt`.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):** The proton at C3 is adjacent to a CH (C4), a CH₂ (C2), and a CH₃. This gives a `dtq`. Like structure A, it lacks the necessary arrangement to produce a `dtt`.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):** The proton at C3 is adjacent to a CH (C2), a CH₂ (from the starting ethyl group), and a CH₂ (from its own ethyl substituent). This gives a `dtt`. However, no proton in this molecule has neighbors of CH, CH₂, and CH₃, so it cannot produce a `dtq`. The other complex signals would likely be doublet of doublet of quartets (ddq).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed ¹H NMR analysis, only the structure corresponding to formula C can account for both a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" signal and a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" signal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n1.  **Very broad absorption at ~3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadening is a hallmark of this functional group.\n2.  **Strong absorption at ~1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position (1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is typical for the carbonyl group in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the class of compound but doesn't distinguish between the options yet.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Splitting Patterns**\n\nThe key to identifying the specific structure lies in the complex splitting patterns observed in the 1H NMR spectrum. The multiplicity of a proton signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (n) following the n+1 rule. For a proton coupled to multiple, different sets of neighboring protons (n₁, n₂, n₃...), the signal is split into a \"multiplet of multiplets,\" with a total of (n₁+1)(n₂+1)(n₃+1)... lines.\n\n1.  **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to one neighboring proton (1H).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to a set of two neighboring protons (a CH₂ group).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Indicates coupling to a set of three neighboring protons (a CH₃ group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton responsible for this signal must be a single proton (a CH group) that is adjacent to three different groups: another CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n\n2.  **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to one neighboring proton (1H).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to a set of two neighboring protons (a CH₂ group).\n    *   **Another triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to a second, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (another CH₂ group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton responsible for this signal must be a single proton (a CH group) that is adjacent to three different groups: another CH group, one CH₂ group, and a second, chemically different CH₂ group.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's interpret the condensed formulas as linear chains and analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons on the main chain.\n\n*   **A) 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid:** `CH₃-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-COOH`\n    *   Let's label the main chain carbons starting from the COOH group: `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)(Et)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** Is coupled to H-2 (1H, gives doublet), CH₂-4 (2H, gives triplet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives triplet). This proton's signal would be a **dtt**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **H-2:** Is coupled to H-3 (1H, gives doublet) and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives triplet). Its signal would be a `dt`.\n    *   This structure gives a `dtt` signal but **lacks a proton that would give a `dtq` signal**. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid:** `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   Let's label the main chain: `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** Is coupled to H-4 (1H, gives doublet), CH₂-2 (2H, gives triplet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives triplet). This proton's signal would be a **dtt**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **H-4:** Is coupled to H-3 (1H, gives doublet), CH₃-5 (3H, gives quartet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives triplet). This proton's signal would be a **dqt** (doublet of quartets of triplets), which has the same components as a `dtq`. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **This structure provides protons that account for BOTH the `dtt` and the `dtq` signals.** Therefore, B is a very strong candidate.\n\n*   **C) 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid:** `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   Let's label the main chain: `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** Is coupled to H-4 (1H, gives doublet), CH₂-2 (2H, gives triplet), and the C3-methyl group (3H, gives quartet). This proton's signal would be a **dqt**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **H-4:** Is coupled to H-3 (1H, gives doublet) and two methyl groups (CH₃-5 and the C4-methyl). These 6 protons would likely split H-4 into a septet. The overall signal would be a `d-sept` or a more complex multiplet if the methyls are non-equivalent (`dqq`), but not a `dtt`.\n    *   This structure gives a `dtq` signal but **lacks a proton that would give a `dtt` signal**. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid:** `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`\n    *   Let's label the main chain: `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** Is coupled to H-2 (1H, gives doublet), CH₂-4 (2H, gives triplet), and the C3-methyl group (3H, gives quartet). This proton's signal would be a **dqt**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **H-2:** Is coupled to H-3 (1H, gives doublet) and the C2-methyl group (3H, gives quartet). Its signal would be a `dq`.\n    *   This structure gives a `dtq` signal but **lacks a proton that would give a `dtt` signal**. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure of 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid (**Option B**) has protons in the correct chemical environments to produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (H-3) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (H-4).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The peak is very broad due to the range of hydrogen bond strengths. It also overlaps with C-H stretching absorptions.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic C=O (carbonyl) stretching frequency for a carboxylic acid dimer (due to hydrogen bonding).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not help distinguish between them.\n\n### 2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to solving the problem lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) of two specific signals.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nThe splitting of a proton signal is determined by the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons (vicinal coupling). The multiplicity follows the n+1 rule. A complex pattern like a `dtq` means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons.\n*   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to 1 adjacent proton (1+1=2 lines).\n*   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to 2 adjacent protons (2+1=3 lines).\n*   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to 3 adjacent protons (3+1=4 lines).\n\nSo, for a signal to be a **dtq**, the corresponding proton must have three neighboring groups of protons: one with 1 proton, one with 2 protons, and one with 3 protons.\n\nFor a signal to be a **dtt**, the corresponding proton must have three neighboring groups of protons: one with 1 proton, two with 2 protons.\n\nThe correct compound must have protons that exhibit **both** of these splitting patterns. Let's analyze the structure of each option. We will number the carbon chain starting with the carboxylic acid carbon as C1.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Each Option**\n\n#### **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n                 CH₃(on C3)\n                  |\n     CH₃-CH₂--CH--CH--COOH\n             |\n            CH₃(on C2)\n     C5 C4  C3   C2   C1\n```\n\n*   **Proton on C3 (H3):** Is coupled to:\n    *   Protons on C4 (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   Proton on C2 (1H) → Doublet (d)\n    *   Protons on the C3-methyl group (3H) → Quartet (q)\n    *   **Splitting Pattern: dtq (or tqd, etc.)**. This **MATCHES** one of the signals.\n\n*   **Is there a dtt?** A `dtt` requires a proton to be coupled to groups of (1H, 2H, 2H). This molecule has only one CH₂ group in its main chain (at C4) and no CH₂ groups in its substituents. It is impossible to find a proton coupled to two different sets of 2H neighbors.\n*   **Conclusion for D:** Has a `dtq`, but no `dtt`. Ruled out.\n\n#### **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n                 C₂H₅ (on C3)\n                  |\n     CH₃-CH₂--CH--CH--COOH\n             |\n            C₂H₅ (on C2)\n     C5 C4  C3   C2   C1\n```\n\n*   **Proton on C3 (H3):** Is coupled to:\n    *   Proton on C2 (1H) → Doublet (d)\n    *   Protons on C4 (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   Protons on the CH₂ of the C3-ethyl group (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   **Splitting Pattern: dtt**. This **MATCHES** the other signal.\n\n*   **Is there a dtq?** A `dtq` requires coupling to a 3H group (like a methyl group). Let's check potential candidates. H2 is a `dt`. H4 is a `dq`. The CH₂ protons on the ethyl groups would be complex but not a `dtq`.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Has a `dtt`, but no `dtq`. Ruled out.\n\n#### **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n            CH₃(on C3) CH₃(on C4)\n             |          |\n     CH₃--CH----CH----CH₂----COOH\n     C5   C4     C3    C2      C1\n```\n\n*   **Proton on C3 (H3):** Is coupled to:\n    *   Protons on C2 (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   Proton on C4 (1H) → Doublet (d)\n    *   Protons on the C3-methyl group (3H) → Quartet (q)\n    *   **Splitting Pattern: dtq**. This **MATCHES** one of the signals.\n\n*   **Is there a dtt?** As with compound D, this molecule lacks the required number of different CH₂ groups to create a `dtt` signal. The proton at C4 is a doublet of septets (coupled to H3 (1H) and the two methyl groups at C5 (6H total)).\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Has a `dtq`, but no `dtt`. Ruled out.\n\n#### **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n\nSince options B, C, and D have been eliminated, A must be the correct answer. Let's confirm by analyzing its structure. The most logical structure represented by this 9-carbon formula is 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid.\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n                 C₂H₅(on C3) C₂H₅(on C4)\n                  |           |\n     CH₃----CH-----CH------CH₂-----COOH\n     C5     C4     C3      C2       C1\n```\n*   **Proton on C3 (H3):** Is coupled to:\n    *   Proton on C4 (1H) → Doublet (d)\n    *   Protons on C2 (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   Protons on the CH₂ of the C3-ethyl group (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   **Splitting Pattern: dtt**.

This **MATCHES** the other required signal.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** The structure for compound A, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, exhibits signals with both the required `dtt` and `dtq` splitting patterns.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only compound whose structure can produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) is the one corresponding to formula A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   All four potential compounds are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group is present but does not help differentiate between the options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   The information that there are no vinyl-hydrogens confirms the absence of C=C double bonds. All four structures are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all options.\n    *   The crucial information lies in the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of two specific signals:\n        *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n        *   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structural Requirements for Each Splitting Pattern:**\n    *   For a **dtq**, a proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving a doublet, d).\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (e.g., a CH₂ group, giving a triplet, t).\n        *   A group of three equivalent neighboring protons (e.g., a CH₃ group, giving a quartet, q).\n        This implies a structural fragment like `CH₃-CH₂-CH*-CH-`, where `H*` is the proton being observed.\n    *   For a **dtt**, a proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving a doublet, d).\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (e.g., a CH₂ group, giving a triplet, t).\n        *   *Another* different group of two equivalent neighboring protons (e.g., a second CH₂ group, giving another triplet, t).\n        This implies a structural fragment like `-CH₂-CH*-CH₂-CH-`, where `H*` is the proton being observed.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Structure:**\n\n    *   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n        `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n        This molecule has only one CH₂ group. It is structurally impossible for any proton to be coupled to two different CH₂ groups, so it cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (Interpreted as 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n        `CH₃-CH₂(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is not correct. Correct interpretation: `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`, which leads to the IUPAC name 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid (as it is an isomer of C9H18O2). If interpreted as 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, (`CH3-CH2-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`, a C10 compound) it has two different protons (on C3 and C4) which could both give `dtt` signals, but no proton that would give a clear `dtq` signal from first-order analysis.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n        `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`\n        The proton on C3 is coupled to the C2 proton (1H, doublet), the C4 methylene protons (2H, triplet), and the C3-methyl protons (3H, quartet). This perfectly matches the requirement for a **dtq**. However, the molecule contains only one CH₂ group, so it is impossible for it to produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n        `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-COOH`\n        Let's analyze the proton on C3 (the third carbon from the COOH group):\n        `CH₃CH₂–CH(Et)–CH(Et)–COOH`\n                       ^\n                     (H on C3)\n        This C3 proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton on C2 (1H) → doublet (d).\n        *   The methylene (CH₂) protons on C4 (2H) → triplet (t).\n        *   The methylene (CH₂) protons of its own ethyl group substituent (2H) → triplet (t).\n        This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This molecule perfectly explains one of the required signals.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Molecule C can explain the `dtq` but not the `dtt`. Molecule D can explain the `dtt` but explaining the `dtq` is not straightforward from a simple first-order analysis (it would likely arise from the accidental simplification of a more complex multiplet like a `ddq` from a diastereotopic methylene group, which is common in complex molecules).\n    However, it is structurally *impossible* for molecule C to produce a `dtt` because it lacks the required number of neighboring CH₂ groups. In contrast, molecule D is a complex structure that contains all the necessary pieces (CH, CH₂, CH₃ groups) and perfectly explains the highly specific `dtt` pattern. Therefore, it is the only plausible structure among the choices that could exhibit both phenomena, even if one requires a more advanced NMR interpretation. Given the options, Molecule D is the best fit.\n\nThe compound is **CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at ~3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to become very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption at ~1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. For a saturated aliphatic carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears in the 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ range.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is present but does not help distinguish between the different isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four structures are fully saturated alkanoic acids, so they are all consistent with this observation.\n*   **Complex Signal Multiplicities:** This is the key piece of information for distinguishing the isomers. We are told the spectrum contains two distinct and complex signals:\n    1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n**3. Deducing the Local Environment from Signal Multiplicities**\n\nWe need to determine what kind of local proton environment would lead to these specific splitting patterns. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent, chemically non-equivalent protons (the 'n+1' rule). When a proton is coupled to multiple different sets of neighboring protons, we observe a multiplet of multiplets.\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** For a proton to show this pattern, it must be simultaneously coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   A group of **one** proton (1+1 = 2 lines, a **d**oublet). This is typically a methine group (`-CH-`).\n    *   A group of **two** equivalent protons (2+1 = 3 lines, a **t**riplet). This is typically a methylene group (`-CH2-`).\n    *   A group of **three** equivalent protons (3+1 = 4 lines, a **q**uartet). This is a methyl group (`-CH3`).\n    *   Therefore, the proton producing the `dtq` signal is a methine proton (`-CH-`) with a `CH`, a `CH2`, and a `CH3` group on adjacent carbons. Schematically: `R-CH-CH(this proton)-CH2-R'` and this proton's carbon is also bonded to a `CH3` group. Or a permutation like: `R-CH2-CH(this proton)(CH3)-CH-R'`.\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** For a proton to show this pattern, it must be coupled to:\n    *   A group of **one** proton (1+1 = 2 lines, a **d**oublet). This is a methine group (`-CH-`).\n    *   A group of **two** equivalent protons (2+1 = 3 lines, a **t**riplet). This is a methylene group (`-CH2-`).\n    *   *Another, different* group of **two** equivalent protons (2+1 = 3 lines, another **t**riplet). This is a second, non-equivalent methylene group (`-CH2-`).\n    *   Therefore, the proton producing the `dtt` signal is a methine proton (`-CH-`) that is adjacent to another `CH` group and two different `CH2` groups. Schematically: `R-CH2-CH(this proton)(CH2-R'')-CH-R'`.\n\n**4. Evaluating Each Candidate Structure**\n\nNow we must examine the structure of each option to see if it contains protons in the required environments to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. We will focus on the methine (`-CH-`) protons in the backbone of each molecule.\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2-CH(c)(CH3)-CH(e)(CH3)-COOH:**\n    *   Proton **H(c)**: Is adjacent to a `-CH2-` group, a `-CH(e)-` group, and a `-CH3` group. Its neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 3H. This proton will be a **dtq**.\n    *   Proton **H(e)**: Is adjacent to a `-CH(c)-` group and a `-CH3` group. Its neighbors are 1H and 3H. This proton will be a doublet of quartets (`dq`).\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Has a `dtq` signal but not a `dtt` signal. Incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH3-CH(b)(CH3)-CH(d)(CH3)-CH2-COOH:**\n    *   Proton **H(b)**: Is adjacent to a `-CH(d)-` group and two `-CH3` groups. Its neighbors are 1H, 3H, and 3H. This proton will be a doublet of quartets of quartets (`dqq`).\n    *   Proton **H(d)**: Is adjacent to a `-CH(b)-` group, a `-CH2-` group, and a `-CH3` group. Its neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 3H. This proton will be a **dtq**.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Has a `dtq` signal but not a `dtt` signal. Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH3CH2-CH(c)(C2H5)-CH(f)(C2H5)-COOH:**\n    *   Proton **H(c)**: Is adjacent to a `-CH2-` from the ethyl on the end, a `-CH(f)-` group, and a `-CH2-` from the ethyl substituent. Its neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 2H. This proton will be a **dtt**.\n    *   Proton **H(f)**: Is adjacent to a `-CH(c)-` group and a `-CH2-` from its ethyl substituent. Its neighbors are 1H and 2H. This proton will be a doublet of triplets (`dt`).\n    *   **Conclusion for C:** Has a `dtt` signal but not a `dtq` signal. Incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH3-CH(f)(C2H5)-CH(c)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH:**\n    *   Proton **H(f)**: This methine proton is on the carbon adjacent to a `CH3-` group, a `CH(c)` group, and a `C2H5` group (specifically its `-CH2-`). The neighboring protons are: the `-CH3` group (3H), the `H(c)` proton (1H), and the `-CH2-` of the ethyl group (2H). This proton will be coupled to groups of 1H, 2H, and 3H, giving a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n    *   Proton **H(c)**: This methine proton is on the carbon adjacent to the `CH(f)` group, the `-CH2-COOH` group, and a `C2H5` group (specifically its `-CH2-`). The neighboring protons are: the `H(f)` proton (1H), the `-CH2-` group next to the acid (2H), and the `-CH2-` of its ethyl substituent (2H). This proton will be coupled to groups of 1H, 2H, and 2H, giving a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n    *   **Conclusion for D:** This structure contains a proton that produces a `dtq` signal AND a different proton that produces a `dtt` signal. This matches the experimental data perfectly.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe only compound that has the necessary structural features to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` in its 1H NMR spectrum is structure D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.

All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group is present in all candidates but doesn't help differentiate them.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four options are saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids, which is consistent with this information.\n*   **Key Signals:** The most useful information comes from the complex splitting patterns described:\n    *   **Signal 1: doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Signal 2: doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\n**3. Understanding the Splitting Patterns**\n\nThe multiplicity of a proton signal is determined by the number of adjacent non-equivalent protons (n) following the n+1 rule. When a proton is coupled to multiple *different* sets of protons, the multiplicities multiply.\n\n*   A **doublet (d)** means the proton is coupled to **1** adjacent proton.\n*   A **triplet (t)** means the proton is coupled to **2** adjacent protons.\n*   A **quartet (q)** means the proton is coupled to **3** adjacent protons.\n\nTherefore:\n*   A **dtq** corresponds to a proton that is simultaneously coupled to three different neighboring groups: one with **1 proton**, one with **2 protons**, and one with **3 protons**.\n*   A **dtt** corresponds to a proton that is simultaneously coupled to three different neighboring groups: one with **1 proton**, one with **2 protons**, and another one with **2 protons**.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Proposed Structure**\n\nWe need to find the structure that contains one proton environment matching the `dtq` pattern and a different proton environment matching the `dtt` pattern.\n\nLet's start by correctly identifying the IUPAC name for each formula, as this helps in systematic analysis. The parent chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the carboxyl group carbon (C1).\n\n*   **A) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` -> `(CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`**\n    *   Name: **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    *   Analysis: The proton at C3 (`-CH(CH3)-`) is coupled to C2-H₂ (2H, triplet), C4-H (1H, doublet), and its own CH₃ (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq**. However, there is no proton in the molecule that is coupled to two different sets of 2 protons, so there is **no dtt**. Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` -> `CH3CH2-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-COOH`**\n    *   Name: **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    *   Analysis: The proton at C3 (`-CH(Et)-`) is coupled to C2-H (1H, doublet), C4-H₂ (2H, triplet), and its ethyl's CH₂ (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt**. However, there is no proton in the molecule coupled to a CH₃ group on an adjacent carbon to produce a quartet, which is a requirement for a `dtq`. Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` -> `CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`**\n    *   Name: **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    *   Analysis: The proton at C3 (`-CH(CH3)-`) is coupled to C2-H (1H, doublet), C4-H₂ (2H, triplet), and its own CH₃ (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq**. Similar to option A, there is no proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal. Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\n    *   First, we determine the correct structure and name. The formula represents `CH3-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`. According to IUPAC rules, we must find the longest carbon chain containing the `COOH` group. That chain is 6 carbons long (`COOH-CH2-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH3`, if you trace through one of the ethyl groups).\n    *   Name: **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n    *   Structure diagram for analysis:\n        `6    5      4       3       2      1`\n        `CH₃--CH₂ -- CH -- CH ----- CH₂ -- COOH`\n                     `|    |`\n                    `CH₃  CH₂CH₃` (Et)\n    *   **Analyze the proton at C4 (H₄):**\n        *   It is a single `CH` proton.\n        *   It is coupled to the two protons on C5 (`CH₂`): multiplicity = triplet (t).\n        *   It is coupled to the single proton on C3 (`CH`): multiplicity = doublet (d).\n        *   It is coupled to the three protons of the methyl group (`CH₃`) attached to it: multiplicity = quartet (q).\n        *   The combined splitting is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n    *   **Analyze the proton at C3 (H₃):**\n        *   It is a single `CH` proton.\n        *   It is coupled to the single proton on C4 (`CH`): multiplicity = doublet (d).\n        *   It is coupled to the two protons on C2 (`CH₂`): multiplicity = triplet (t).\n        *   It is coupled to the two protons of its ethyl group's `CH₂`: multiplicity = triplet (t).\n        *   The combined splitting is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\nStructure D, which is correctly named 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, is the only compound that contains a proton with a `dtq` splitting pattern and another proton with a `dtt` splitting pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\n**1.

Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in deciphering the complex splitting patterns reported in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons according to the n+1 rule. For complex molecules with multiple sets of neighboring protons, the splitting pattern becomes multiplicative (e.g., a doublet of triplets).\n\n*   **Given Signals:**\n    *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n*   **Interpretation of Splitting Patterns:**\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** A proton responsible for this signal must be adjacent to three different sets of protons:\n        *   One proton (1H) causing the doublet (d) splitting.\n        *   Two equivalent protons (2H) causing the triplet (t) splitting.\n        *   Three equivalent protons (3H) causing the quartet (q) splitting.\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** A proton responsible for this signal must be adjacent to three different sets of protons:\n        *   One proton (1H) causing the doublet (d) splitting.\n        *   Two equivalent protons (2H) causing the first triplet (t) splitting.\n        *   Another set of two equivalent protons (2H) causing the second triplet (t) splitting.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each option to see which one would produce these specific splitting patterns for its protons. The protons on chiral centers (`CH`) are the most likely candidates for such complex splitting.\n\n*   **Structure A: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `(CH₃)₂CH(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   H on C3: Neighbors are H on C4 (1H, gives doublet) and CH₂ on C2 (2H, gives triplet). The splitting is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**. This does not match.\n    *   H on C4: Neighbors are H on C3 (1H, gives doublet) and the six protons of the two methyl groups (6H, gives septet).

Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in interpreting the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four given structures (they are all saturated carboxylic acids).\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This indicates that a proton (or a set of equivalent protons) is being split by three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups of protons:\n    *   A group with **one** proton (n=1), leading to a **d**oublet (n+1=2).\n    *   A group with **two** protons (n=2), leading to a **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n    *   A group with **three** protons (n=3), leading to a **q**uartet (n+1=4).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates another proton (or set of protons) is being split by three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups of protons:\n    *   A group with **one** proton (n=1), leading to a **d**oublet (n+1=2).\n    *   A group with **two** protons (n=2), leading to a **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n    *   Another, non-equivalent group with **two** protons (n=2), leading to another **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n\n### **3. Structural Analysis of the Options**\n\nLet's deduce the structure for each option and predict the splitting patterns for the protons on the main chain, as these are the most likely candidates for such complex splitting. We will assume the formulas are written sequentially along the main carbon backbone and use IUPAC naming to clarify the structures. The COOH group is C1.\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)(Et)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** Coupled to H-2 (1H, gives a doublet), CH₂ of the ethyl group at C-3 (2H, gives a triplet), and CH₂(4) (2H, gives a triplet). The resulting pattern is **dtt**.\n    *   We need to find a `dtq`. Let's look at other protons. The CH₂ protons at C-4 are diastereotopic and would likely give `ddq` signals. Protons within the ethyl groups would also show complex patterns, but a `dtq` is not apparent. So, this molecule has a `dtt` but is missing the `dtq`.\n\n*   **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** This proton is coupled to H-4 (1H, gives a **d**oublet), the CH₂ protons at C-2 (2H, gives a **t**riplet), and the CH₂ protons of the ethyl group at C-3 (2H, gives a **t**riplet). The predicted splitting pattern is **dtt**.\n    *   **H-4:** This proton is coupled to H-3 (1H, gives a **d**oublet), the CH₂ protons of the ethyl group at C-4 (2H, gives a **t**riplet), and the CH₃ protons at C-5 (3H, gives a **q**uartet). The predicted splitting pattern is **dtq**.\n    *   This structure gives rise to both a `dtt` (from H-3) and a `dtq` (from H-4). This is a perfect match for the data.\n\n*   **C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH → 4,5-dimethylhexanoic acid**\n    `(CH₃)₂CH(5)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-4:** Coupled to H-5 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂ protons at C-3 (2H, gives a triplet), and the methyl protons on C-4 (3H, gives a quartet). The pattern is **dtq**.\n    *   **H-5:** Coupled to H-4 (1H, gives a doublet) and the six protons of the two methyl groups (6H, gives a septet). The pattern is a doublet of septets.\n    *   This molecule has a `dtq` but is missing the `dtt`.\n\n*   **D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(2)(Me)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** Coupled to H-2 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂ protons at C-4 (2H, gives a triplet), and the methyl protons on C-3 (3H, gives a quartet). The pattern is **dtq**.\n    *   The molecule has a `dtq` but lacks a proton that would give a `dtt` pattern.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically analyzing the expected ¹H NMR splitting patterns for each of the four possible structures, only compound B provides signals that match the experimental data of having both a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to become very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not yet distinguish between the candidates.\n\n### 2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This tells us there are no protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four proposed structures are saturated alkanoic acids, so they are all consistent with this piece of information.\n*   **A signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern means the proton responsible for this signal is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   A set of two neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   A set of three neighboring protons (n=3), which splits the signal into a **quartet**.\n    For a proton to have a `dtq` splitting pattern, its neighbors must be a `CH`, a `CH2` group, and a `CH3` group.\n*   **A different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This proton is also coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   A set of two neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   Another, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into another **triplet**.\n    For a proton to have a `dtt` splitting pattern, its neighbors must be a `CH` group and two different `CH2` groups.\n\n### 3. Evaluating Each Candidate Structure\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons in each molecule, focusing on the methine (CH) protons, as they are most likely to show such complex splitting. The IUPAC names help in visualizing the structures.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: This proton is adjacent to the C2-H (1 proton), the C4-H₂ (2 protons), and the C3-methyl (3 protons). The neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 3H. This would indeed produce a **dtq**.\n*   No proton in this molecule is adjacent to one CH group and two distinct CH₂ groups. Therefore, a `dtt` signal is not expected.\n\n**B) CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: This proton is adjacent to the C2-H₂ (2 protons), the C4-H (1 proton), and the C3-methyl (3 protons). The neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 3H. This would also produce a **dtq**.\n*   No proton in this molecule is adjacent to one CH group and two distinct CH₂ groups. Therefore, a `dtt` signal is not expected.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nThis formula is best interpreted by drawing the structure:\n      CH₂CH₃  CH₂CH₃\n      |       |\nCH₃ - CH -- CH -- CH₂ -- COOH\n    (C5) (C4)   (C3)   (C2)   (C1)\nLet's analyze the two methine (CH) protons:\n*   **H at C4:** This proton is adjacent to the C5-H₃ group (3 protons), the C3-H (1 proton), and the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2 protons). Its neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 3H. This proton will show a **dtq** signal. **(Match)**\n*   **H at C3:** This proton is adjacent to the C2-H₂ group (2 protons), the C4-H (1 proton), and the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2 protons). Its neighbors are one CH group (1H) and two non-equivalent CH₂ groups (2H and 2H). This proton will show a **dtt** signal. **(Match)**\n\n**Conclusion for C:** This structure is the only one that predicts both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nStructure:\n      CH₂CH₃  CH₂CH₃\n      |       |\nCH₃CH₂- CH -- CH -- COOH\n     (C4)   (C3)   (C2)   (C1)\n*   **H at C3:** This proton is adjacent to the C2-H (1 proton), the C4-H₂ (2 protons), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2 protons). Its neighbors are one CH group and two CH₂ groups. This would produce a **dtt**.\n*   **H at C2:** This proton is adjacent to the C3-H (1 proton) and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C2 (2 protons). Its neighbors are 1H and 2H. This would produce a `dt` (doublet of triplets), not a `dtq`. No other proton fits the requirement for a `dtq`.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR splitting patterns, only structure C, **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, can account for the presence of both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\n**1. Deconstruct the Provided Information**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four given structures are saturated, which is consistent with this information.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This splitting pattern arises when a proton (or a set of equivalent protons) is coupled to three different sets of neighboring non-equivalent protons. The number of neighbors is given by (multiplicity - 1).\n        *   Doublet (d) -> coupled to 1 proton.\n        *   Triplet (t) -> coupled to 2 protons.\n        *   Quartet (q) -> coupled to 3 protons.\n        *   Therefore, the proton giving the `dtq` signal must have three distinct neighboring groups: a single proton (`CH`), a methylene group (`CH₂`), and a methyl group (`CH₃`).\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** Using the same logic:\n        *   Doublet (d) -> coupled to 1 proton.\n        *   Triplet (t) -> coupled to 2 protons.\n        *   Triplet (t) -> coupled to another group of 2 protons.\n        *   Therefore, the proton giving the `dtt` signal must have three distinct neighboring groups: a single proton (`CH`) and two different methylene groups (`CH₂`).\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Structures**\n\nThe goal is to find the single molecule that contains *both* a proton with the environment for a `dtq` signal and *another* proton with the environment for a `dtt` signal.\n\nLet's represent the condensed formulas with clearer structural drawings and analyze the protons on the main chain (methine protons, `CH`), as these are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nThis formula represents **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n\nStructure:\n```\n      (f)CH₃ - (e)CH - (d)CH - (c)CH₂ - (b,a)COOH\n                |      |\n             (g,h)C₂H₅ (i,j)C₂H₅\n```\n*   **Proton He (on C4):** Let's examine its neighbors.\n    *   It is coupled to the proton **Hd on C3** (1H).\n    *   It is coupled to the three protons of the **methyl group CH₃(f)** (3H).\n    *   It is coupled to the two protons of the **methylene group CH₂(g)** of its ethyl side-chain.\n    *   **Neighbors: 1H, 3H, 2H.** This environment will produce a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**, which matches one of the signals.\n\n*   **Proton Hd (on C3):** Let's examine its neighbors.\n    *   It is coupled to the proton **He on C4** (1H).\n    *   It is coupled to the two protons of the **methylene group CH₂(c)** in the main chain.\n    *   It is coupled to the two protons of the **methylene group CH₂(i)** of its ethyl side-chain.\n    *   **Neighbors: 1H, 2H, 2H.** This environment will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, which matches the other signal.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** This molecule possesses protons corresponding to both `dqt` and `dtt` signals. It is a very strong candidate.\n\n**B) CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH** (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)\n*   **Proton on C3:** Neighbors are H on C4 (1H), CH₃ on C3 (3H), and CH₂ on C2 (2H). This gives a `dqt`.\n*   This molecule does **not** contain any proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H), so it cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH** (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)\n*   **Proton on C3:** Neighbors are H on C2 (1H), CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H), and CH₂ of the terminal ethyl group (2H). This gives a `dtt`.\n*   This molecule does **not** contain any proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H), so it cannot produce a `dqt` signal.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH** (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)\n*   **Proton on C3:** Neighbors are H on C2 (1H), CH₃ on C3 (3H), and the CH₂ of the terminal ethyl group (2H).

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound, synthesized from the most consistent logic across the provided answers.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The peak is extremely broad due to the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding that occurs between carboxylic acid molecules (dimerization).\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. For a saturated carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears in the 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ range.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The FTIR data strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). Since all four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, this information confirms the class of compound but does not distinguish between the specific isomers. The deciding information must come from the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe ¹H NMR data provides the structural details needed to identify the correct isomer.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of any protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, consistent with this information.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The problem states that the spectrum contains two particularly complex and informative signals:\n    1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nLet's break down what these splitting patterns mean in terms of neighboring protons, based on the n+1 rule:\n*   **Doublet (d):** means the proton is coupled to **one** neighboring proton (n=1).\n*   **Triplet (t):** means the proton is coupled to **two** neighboring protons (n=2).\n*   **Quartet (q):** means the proton is coupled to **three** neighboring protons (n=3).\n\nTherefore:\n*   A **dtq** corresponds to a proton that is simultaneously coupled to three different neighboring groups: one with **1 proton**, one with **2 protons**, and one with **3 protons**. A likely candidate is a methine (-CH-) proton adjacent to another methine group, a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   A **dtt** corresponds to a proton that is simultaneously coupled to three different neighboring groups: one with **1 proton**, one with **2 protons**, and another, chemically distinct, group with **2 protons**. A likely candidate is a methine (-CH-) proton adjacent to another methine group and two different methylene groups.\n\n**3. Evaluating Each Candidate Structure**\n\nWe need to find the single structure that contains one proton environment that would produce a `dtq` signal and a different proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.

This would give a **dtq**. However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to one proton and two different CH₂ groups, so it cannot produce a **dtt**.

This would give a **dtt**. However, no proton has the required neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) to produce a `dtq`.

This would give a **dtq**. However, this molecule lacks a proton with the neighbors required for a `dtt` signal. Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    Let's draw this structure and analyze the protons on the main chain.\n    `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n\n    *   **Proton on C3 (H-3):** This methine proton has three different neighboring groups:\n        1.  The proton on C4 (H-4), which is a single proton → **doublet (d)**.\n        2.  The two protons on C2 (a `CH₂` group) → **triplet (t)**.\n        3.  The two protons of the `CH₂` group on its own ethyl side chain → **triplet (t)**.\n        The combined multiplicity for H-3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n\n    *   **Proton on C4 (H-4):** This methine proton also has three different neighboring groups:\n        1.  The proton on C3 (H-3), which is a single proton → **doublet (d)**.\n        2.  The two protons of the `CH₂` group on its own ethyl side chain → **triplet (t)**.\n        3.  The three protons of the terminal methyl group at C5 → **quartet (q)**.\n        The combined multiplicity for H-4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.

Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The peak is broad due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the options lies in the complex splitting patterns described. We need to find a structure that has protons matching these descriptions.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1, n+1=2 lines).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3 lines).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, n+1=4 lines).\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This proton is also split by three different sets of neighbors.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1, n+1=2 lines).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3 lines).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to another set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3 lines).\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's draw each structure and predict the splitting patterns for its unique protons. We will number the main carbon chain starting from the carboxyl carbon (C1).\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid**\n`CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **H at C4:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet), H's at C5 (2H, triplet), and H's on its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet) and H's on its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   This structure provides a `dtt` but not a `dtq`. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\nThis formula represents the following structure:\n`CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\nLet's analyze the protons on the main chain:\n*   **H at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The H at C3 (1H) → **doublet**\n    *   The two H's of the ethyl group attached to C4 (2H) → **triplet**\n    *   The three H's of the methyl group at C5 (3H) → **quartet**\n    *   This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n*   **H at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The H at C4 (1H) → **doublet**\n    *   The two H's of the ethyl group attached to C3 (2H) → **triplet**\n    *   The two H's of the CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet**\n    *   This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n*   This structure perfectly matches both pieces of complex splitting information from the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **H at C4:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, d), H's at C5 (3H, q), and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This would be a complex signal (dqd), but not a dtq.\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C4 (1H, d), H's at C2 (2H, t), and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This gives a dqt.\n*   This structure does not match the data.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H, d), H's at C4 (2H, t), and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This gives a dtq. However, let's check for the dtt.\n*   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, d) and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This gives a dq.\n*   This structure provides a `dtq` (or tdq) but not a `dtt`. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure **B**, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, can produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in its ¹H NMR spectrum. The FTIR data is also consistent with this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   \"No vinyl-hydrogens\": This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four options are saturated, so this is consistent.\n    *   \"One of the signals... is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\". This means a specific proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing the doublet (d) splitting (n+1=2).\n        *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing the triplet (t) splitting (n+1=3).\n        *   Three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), causing the quartet (q) splitting (n+1=4).\n        *   Note: The order of the letters (d, t, q) can vary depending on the relative size of the coupling constants (J-values), but the chemical meaning remains the same: the proton is coupled to a 1H, a 2H, and a 3H set of neighbors. We will look for a proton with this environment, which could be described as `dtq`, `dqt`, `tqd`, `tdq`, `qdt`, or `qtd`.\n    *   \"A different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\". This means another specific proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a doublet (d).\n        *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a triplet (t).\n        *   Another, different set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a second triplet (t).\n        *   We are looking for a proton coupled to a 1H, a 2H, and another 2H set of neighbors. This could be described as `dtt` or `tdt`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Structure of Each Option\n\nWe need to interpret the condensed structural formulas and predict the splitting patterns for the protons in each molecule. We will assume a standard linear interpretation of the formulas and use IUPAC naming to clarify the structures.\n\n**A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This formula corresponds to **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH3(5)`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H4**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `H3` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   `CH3(5)` (3 neighbors) -> quartet (q)\n        *   The `CH2` of its ethyl group (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This gives a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**. This matches the `dtq` signal required.\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H3**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `CH2(2)` (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   `H4` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   The `CH2` of its ethyl group (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This gives a **triplet of doublets of triplets (tdt)**. A `tdt` pattern arises from coupling to (2H, 1H, 2H), while a `dtt` arises from (1H, 2H, 2H). Both are split by one proton and two different sets of two protons, resulting in 18 lines (in a first-order spectrum). Given the options, it is highly probable that this `tdt` signal is the one described as `dtt`.\n\n**B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This corresponds to **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(Et)(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH3(5)`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H3**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `H2` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   `CH2(4)` (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   The `CH2` of its ethyl group (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   Does it have a `dqt` signal? Let's check other protons. H2 is a doublet of triplets (`dt`). The `CH2` protons are all doublets of quartets (`dq`). There is no proton coupled to (1H, 2H, 3H).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtt` but lacks a `dqt`.\n\n**C) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This corresponds to **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(Me)(2)-CH(Me)(3)-CH2(4)-CH3(5)`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H3**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `H2` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   `CH2(4)` (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   The `CH3` on its own carbon (3 neighbors) -> quartet (q)\n        *   This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   Does it have a `dtt` signal? No. H2 is a `dq`. H4 is a `dq`. There is no proton coupled to (1H, 2H, 2H).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtq` but lacks a `dtt`.\n\n**D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This corresponds to **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `(CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Proton H3 is coupled to `CH2(2)` (2H, t), `H4` (1H, d), and `CH3` on C3 (3H, q). This gives a `tdq`. This matches the `dtq` requirement.\n    *   Proton H4 is coupled to `H3` (1H, d) and the six protons of the isopropyl group (6H, septet). This gives a `doublet of septets`. It does not have a `dtt` signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtq`-type signal but lacks a `dtt`.\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the splitting patterns for each structure, we find the following:\n*   **A) 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `dqt` signal and a `tdt` signal.\n*   **B) 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `dtt` signal, but no `dqt` signal.\n*   **C) 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `dtq` signal, but no `dtt` signal.\n*   **D) 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `tdq` (or `dqt`) signal, but no `dtt` signal.\n\nOnly structure **A** possesses two different protons that exhibit the required high level of complex splitting: one proton is coupled to a (1H, 2H, 3H) environment, and another is coupled to a (1H, 2H, 2H) or (2H, 1H, 2H) environment. The signal described as `dtt` in the problem corresponds to the `tdt` signal from structure A. Therefore, structure A is the only option that fits all the data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to be very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the options.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four proposed structures are saturated, so they are all consistent with this piece of information.\n*   **\"One of the signals... is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\"**: This is a very complex splitting pattern, which means the proton responsible for this signal is coupled to three different sets of non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d)** implies coupling to **1** neighboring proton.\n    *   **Triplet (t)** implies coupling to **2** neighboring protons.\n    *   **Quartet (q)** implies coupling to **3** neighboring protons.\n    *   Therefore, a proton showing a `dtq` signal must have neighbors: a `CH` group (1H), a `CH₂` group (2H), and a `CH₃` group (3H).\n*   **\"...a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\"**: This proton is also coupled to three different sets of non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d)** implies coupling to **1** neighboring proton.\n    *   **Triplet (t)** implies coupling to **2** neighboring protons.\n    *   **Another Triplet (t)** implies coupling to another, different `CH₂` group (2H).\n    *   Therefore, a proton showing a `dtt` signal must have neighbors: a `CH` group (1H), a `CH₂` group, and another non-equivalent `CH₂` group.\n\n**3. Structural Analysis of the Options**\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each option to see if it can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₂(e)-CH₃(a)`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is adjacent to H(c) (1H), a CH₃ group (3H), and a CH₂(e) group (2H). This would give a **dqt** signal. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **dtt check:** To have a `dtt` signal, a proton needs to be adjacent to one CH and two different CH₂ groups. This molecule only contains one CH₂ group (e). Therefore, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. Option A is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH₂(d)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₃(a)`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is adjacent to H(b) (1H), a CH₂(d) group (2H), and a CH₃ group (3H). This would give a **dqt** signal. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **dtt check:** This molecule only contains one CH₂ group (d). Therefore, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. Option D is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH(c)(Et)-CH(b)(Et)-CH₂(d)CH₃(e)`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is adjacent to H(c) (1H), the CH₂ of its own ethyl substituent (2H), and the CH₂(d) of the backbone (2H). This would give a **dtt** signal. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **dqt check:** To have a `dqt` signal, a proton needs to be adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group. Let's check the protons. None of the CH protons (b or c) are adjacent to a methyl group. The protons of the CH₂ groups (e.g., d) are adjacent to a CH (b) and a CH₃ (e), but not another CH₂ group. They are also adjacent to each other (geminal coupling, 1H). This would result in a `ddq` (doublet of doublets of quartets), not a `dqt`. Option C is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\nFirst, let's determine the correct structure from this condensed formula. The main chain is `C-C(Et)-C(Et)-C-COOH`. To find the IUPAC name, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group. This is a 6-carbon chain, making it a hexanoic acid derivative.\nThe structure is `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\nLet's analyze the key protons in **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**:\n```\n          CH₃(g)   C₂H₅(e,f)\n          |        |\nHOOC-CH₂(a)-CH(b)----CH(c)----CH₂(d)-CH₃(h)\n```\n*   **Proton H(c):** This proton is on carbon 4. It is adjacent to:\n    *   H(b) on carbon 3 (1H) → doublet (d)\n    *   CH₂(d) on carbon 5 (2H) → triplet (t)\n    *   CH₃(g) substituent (3H) → quartet (q)\n    The resulting signal for H(c) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dqt)**. This matches the first described signal.\n\n*   **Proton H(b):** This proton is on carbon 3. It is adjacent to:\n    *   H(c) on carbon 4 (1H) → doublet (d)\n    *   CH₂(a) on carbon 2 (2H) → triplet (t)\n    *   CH₂(e) of its ethyl substituent (2H) → triplet (t)\n    The resulting signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second described signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe structure of 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, which is represented by the condensed formula in option B, is the only one that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data. It is a carboxylic acid, has no vinyl protons, and its structure predicts the presence of both a `dqt` and a `dtt` signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules (containing only single C-C bonds), so this observation is consistent with all of them.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The most crucial pieces of information are the complex splitting patterns observed for two different protons:\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\n**3. Understanding Complex Splitting (n+1 rule)**\n\nThe splitting of a proton's signal is determined by the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons (vicinal coupling). A signal is split into `n+1` peaks, where `n` is the number of neighboring protons.\n\n*   A **doublet (d)** means 1 neighboring proton (`1+1=2`).\n*   A **triplet (t)** means 2 neighboring protons (`2+1=3`).\n*   A **quartet (q)** means 3 neighboring protons (`3+1=4`).\n\nA complex pattern like `dtq` or `dtt` arises when a proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons. To have three neighboring groups, the proton must be on a carbon that is bonded to three other carbons, each bearing protons.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze each structure to see if its protons would produce the observed splitting patterns.

The longest chain including the COOH is a pentanoic acid with ethyl groups at positions 3 and 4. So this is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    *   `CH3(a) - CH(b)(C2H5) - CH(c)(C2H5) - CH2(d) - COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(c):** Is adjacent to `CH2(d)` (2H), `CH(b)` (1H), and the `CH2` of its own ethyl group (2H).\n        *   Coupling to `CH2(d)` (2H) -> triplet (t)\n        *   Coupling to `CH(b)` (1H) -> doublet (d)\n        *   Coupling to its ethyl `CH2` (2H) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This proton's signal would be a **dtt**.

This matches Signal 1.\n    *   *Conclusion: Structure B has protons that produce both a dtt and a dtq. This is the correct structure.*\n\n**Final Identification**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the splitting patterns in the 1H NMR spectrum, only structure B, `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`, is consistent with the observation of both a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the candidates.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four candidate structures are saturated, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The most crucial information comes from the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) of two different signals:\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nTo understand these patterns, we use the n+1 rule. A signal is split into n+1 lines by 'n' equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of protons, the multiplicities multiply.\n\n*   A **dtq** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n    *   One proton (1+1 = 2, a **d**oublet)\n    *   Two equivalent protons (2+1 = 3, a **t**riplet)\n    *   Three equivalent protons (3+1 = 4, a **q**uartet)\n*   A **dtt** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n    *   One proton (1+1 = 2, a **d**oublet)\n    *   Two equivalent protons (2+1 = 3, a **t**riplet)\n    *   Another set of two equivalent protons (2+1 = 3, another **t**riplet)\n\nNow, we must analyze the structure of each candidate to see which one would produce both of these signals from two different protons in the molecule.\n\n### **3. Structural Analysis of Candidates**\n\nThe condensed formulas can be ambiguous. Let's interpret them into standard structural drawings and analyze the protons, focusing on the methine (CH) protons on the main carbon chain, as these are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\n*   **Candidate A: `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   ` (CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH `\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to a CH (1H), a CH₂ (2H), and a CH₃ (3H). This would give a **dtq**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule coupled to a CH and two different CH₂ groups. Therefore, it cannot produce a **dtt**.\n\n*   **Candidate C: `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` -> 2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   ` CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH `\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to a CH (1H, at C2), a CH₂ (2H, from the ethyl group), and a CH₃ (3H, the methyl at C3). This gives a **dtq**.\n    *   Again, there is no proton coupled to a CH and two different CH₂ groups, so it cannot produce a **dtt**.\n\n*   **Candidate D: `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` -> 2,3-Diethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   ` CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH `\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to a CH (1H, at C2), a CH₂ (2H, from the main chain ethyl group), and another CH₂ (2H, from the ethyl substituent at C3). This gives a **dtt**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule coupled to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃. Therefore, it cannot produce a **dtq**.\n\n*   **Candidate B: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\n    This formula is ambiguously written. The most plausible chemical structure that can be formed from these atoms and result in the given NMR signals is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n    Let's draw this structure and analyze its protons:\n    ```\n                    CH₃ (at C4)\n                    |\n      CH₃-CH₂---CH---CH---CH₂---COOH\n                         |\n                         CH₂-CH₃ (at C3)\n    ```\n    Let's analyze the two key methine (CH) protons:\n    1.  **Proton at C4 (H-C4):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton at C3 (1H) -> **doublet**\n        *   The CH₂ group at C5 (2H) -> **triplet**\n        *   The CH₃ group attached at C4 (3H) -> **quartet**\n        *   The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n    2.  **Proton at C3 (H-C3):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton at C4 (1H) -> **doublet**\n        *   The CH₂ group at C2 (2H) -> **triplet**\n        *   The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent at C3 (2H) -> **triplet**\n        *   The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid (Option B)** can produce both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n### **2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four candidate molecules are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: For a signal to be split this way, the corresponding proton(s) must be coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1, gives a 1+1 = **doublet**)\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2, gives a 2+1 = **triplet**)\n    *   Three neighboring protons (n=3, gives a 3+1 = **quartet**)\n    This pattern typically arises from a methine proton (-CH-) adjacent to another methine group (-CH-), a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: Similarly, this pattern means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1, gives a 1+1 = **doublet**)\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2, gives a 2+1 = **triplet**)\n    *   Another, different set of two neighboring protons (n=2, gives a 2+1 = **triplet**)\n    This pattern typically arises from a methine proton (-CH-) adjacent to another methine group (-CH-), a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a second, non-equivalent methylene group (-CH₂-).\n\nThe question states that the spectrum contains *both* a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal. We must now examine the structure of each candidate to see which one has protons in environments that would produce both of these specific patterns.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's draw and analyze each molecule. We will label the methine (CH) protons as they are the most likely candidates for such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n\n```\n      CH₃  CH₃\n      |    |\nCH₃-CH₂--CH--CH--COOH\n    (4)  (3)  (2)\n```\n\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), the -CH₂- at C4 (2H, triplet), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** (or dqt/tqd). This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the -CH₃ on C2 (3H, quartet). This gives a **dq**.\n*   This molecule has a `dtq` but does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtt`.\n\n**B) CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n\n```\n      CH₃  CH₃\n      |    |\nCH₃--CH--CH--CH₂--COOH\n    (4)  (3)  (2)\n```\n\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to the -CH₂- at C2 (2H, triplet), H at C4 (1H, doublet), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H, quartet). This gives a **tdq** (or dqt/dtq). This matches one requirement.\n*   **H at C4:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet), the terminal -CH₃ (3H, quartet), and the -CH₃ on C4 (3H, quartet). This gives a **dqq**.\n*   This molecule has a `dtq` but does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtt`.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n\n```\n      C₂H₅ C₂H₅\n      |    |\nCH₃-CH₂--CH--CH--COOH\n    (4)  (3)  (2)\n```\n\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), the -CH₂- at C4 (2H, triplet), and the -CH₂- of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the -CH₂- of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **dt**.\n*   This molecule has a `dtt` but does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtq`.\n\n**D) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n\nLet's parse this formula carefully. It represents: `CH₃ - CH(C₂H₅) - CH(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - COOH`\nLet's number the chain according to IUPAC rules, starting from the carboxyl carbon as C1.\n\n```\n      C₂H₅ C₂H₅\n      |    |\nCH₃--CH--CH--CH₂--COOH\n  (5) (4)  (3)  (2)   (1)\n```\n\nNow let's analyze the key methine protons, H at C3 and H at C4.\n\n*   **H at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The two protons on C2 (-CH₂-) → **triplet**\n    *   The single proton on C4 (-CH-) → **doublet**\n    *   The two protons on its attached ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) → **triplet**\n    The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n\n*   **H at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The three protons on C5 (-CH₃) → **quartet**\n    *   The single proton on C3 (-CH-) → **doublet**\n    *   The two protons on its attached ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) → **triplet**\n    The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other required signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nCompound **D** is the only structure that has methine protons in environments that would produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`). Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n### **1.

Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad absorption in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong absorption peak in the 1680-1725 cm⁻¹ range is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described.\n*   No vinyl-hydrogens: This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four saturated structures.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This signal corresponds to a proton (let's call it H_A) that is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), giving a doublet (n+1=2).\n    *   A set of two neighboring protons (n=2), giving a triplet (n+1=3).\n    *   A set of three neighboring protons (n=3), giving a quartet (n+1=4).\n    This implies H_A is a methine proton (`-CH-`) adjacent to a `CH` group, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This signal corresponds to a different proton (H_B) that is also coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), giving a doublet (n+1=2).\n    *   A set of two neighboring protons (n=2), giving a triplet (n+1=3).\n    *   Another, chemically non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (n=2), giving another triplet (n+1=3).\n    This implies H_B is a methine proton (`-CH-`) adjacent to a `CH` group and two different `CH₂` groups.\n\n### 3. Evaluating Each Candidate Structure\n\nLet's determine the IUPAC name and predict the splitting patterns for the methine (`CH`) protons in each option.

We need to find the molecule whose spectrum would contain both of the complex signals described. The multiplicity (splitting) of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (n) and follows the n+1 rule. A complex splitting pattern like a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" arises when a proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This means a single proton is coupled to:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1).\n    *   A group of two neighboring protons (giving the **t**riplet, n=2).\n    *   A group of three neighboring protons (giving the **q**uartet, n=3).\n    *   In summary, the proton has a {1H, 2H, 3H} set of neighbors.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means a different single proton is coupled to:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1).\n    *   A group of two neighboring protons (giving the first **t**riplet, n=2).\n    *   A different group of two neighboring protons (giving the second **t**riplet, n=2).\n    *   In summary, this proton has a {1H, 2H, 2H} set of neighbors.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each candidate molecule to see which one matches these requirements.

Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to be very broad.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position (around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is typical for the carbonyl group in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in deciphering the complex splitting patterns described. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent non-equivalent protons (n) according to the (n+1) rule. Complex splitting (multiplet of multiplets) occurs when a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated compounds, which is consistent with this information.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a proton (let's call it H_A) is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet:** H_A is adjacent to one proton (n=1, 1+1=2).\n    *   **Triplet:** H_A is adjacent to a group of two equivalent protons (like a CH₂ group, n=2, 2+1=3).\n    *   **Quartet:** H_A is adjacent to a group of three equivalent protons (like a CH₃ group, n=3, 3+1=4).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton with the following neighbors: a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different proton (let's call it H_B) is also coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet:** H_B is adjacent to one proton (n=1, 1+1=2).\n    *   **Triplet:** H_B is adjacent to a group of two equivalent protons (a CH₂ group, n=2, 2+1=3).\n    *   **Triplet:** H_B is also adjacent to a *different* group of two equivalent protons (another CH₂ group, n=2, 2+1=3).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton with the following neighbors: a CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n**3. Evaluating Each Structure**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it contains protons that would produce both of these specific splitting patterns. We will number the carbon chain starting from the COOH group as carbon 1.\n\n*   **A) 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid (CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH):**\n    *   H at C3 is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ at C3 (3H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to one proton and two different CH₂ groups.

This would give a **triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq)**, which is the same pattern as a dtq. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   There is no proton coupled to one proton and two different CH₂ groups. Thus, it cannot produce Signal 2. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid (CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH):**\n    *   H at C3 is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H), and the CH₂ at C4 (2H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to one proton, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group. Thus, it cannot produce Signal 1. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:**\n    This condensed formula is ambiguous. To determine the structure, we must draw it out and apply IUPAC rules to find the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group.\n    `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n    The longest chain is a heptanoic acid derivative:\n    `COOH(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(5)-CH₂(6)-CH₃(7)`\n    The correct name is **3-ethyl-4-methylheptanoic acid**. Let's analyze the key protons in this structure:\n    *   **H at C4:** This proton is coupled to H at C3 (1H), the CH₃ group attached to C4 (3H), and the CH₂ group at C5 (2H). This environment (neighbors: 1H, 3H, 2H) will produce a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**. This matches the pattern of Signal 1.\n    *   **H at C3:** This proton is coupled to H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H), and the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H). This environment (neighbors: 1H, 2H, 2H) will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option B, which is correctly identified as 3-ethyl-4-methylheptanoic acid, contains protons that would generate both a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, consistent with the value for a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.

Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated compounds, which is consistent with this information.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The spectrum shows two particularly complex signals:\n    1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nTo identify the compound, we need to find a structure that can produce both of these specific splitting patterns. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent non-equivalent protons (n) according to the n+1 rule. For complex splitting, a proton is coupled to multiple different sets of neighboring protons.\n\n*   A **dtq** arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a set of 1 proton (giving a doublet), a set of 2 protons (giving a triplet), and a set of 3 protons (giving a quartet). The neighbor counts are **{1H, 2H, 3H}**.\n*   A **dtt** arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a set of 1 proton (giving a doublet), a set of 2 protons (giving a triplet), and another set of 2 protons (giving another triplet). The neighbor counts are **{1H, 2H, 2H}**.\n\n**3. Analysis of Each Candidate Structure**\n\nFor this analysis, we will analyze the expected splitting for each methine (CH) proton. We will make a common simplifying assumption that protons on a CH₂ group adjacent to a chiral center are \"accidentally equivalent\" and thus split signals into a simple triplet. Without this assumption, the patterns would be much more complex (e.g., doublet of doublets) and would not match the given names (dtq, dtt).\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH₂(d)-COOH`\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H(c)**. Its neighbors are: H(b) (1H), the CH₂(d) group (2H), and the adjacent CH₃ group (3H).\n    *   Neighbor counts for H(c): **{1H, 2H, 3H}**. This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, no other proton in this molecule has the neighbor counts {1H, 2H, 2H} required to produce a dtt. Thus, molecule A is unlikely.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `(CH₃CH₂)-CH(c)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₂CH₃)-COOH`\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H(c)**. Its neighbors are: H(b) (1H), the CH₂ group of the main chain ethyl (2H), and the CH₂ group of the side-chain ethyl (2H).\n    *   Neighbor counts for H(c): **{1H, 2H, 2H}**. This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, no other proton in this molecule has the neighbor counts {1H, 2H, 3H} required to produce a dtq. Thus, molecule B is unlikely.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,5-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `(CH₃)-CH(b)(C₂H₅)-CH₂-CH(d)(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   Proton H(b) neighbors: {CH₃(3H), main-chain CH₂(2H), ethyl CH₂(2H)}. This gives a qtt (quartet of triplets of triplets).\n    *   Proton H(d) neighbors: {main-chain CH₂(2H), alpha-CH₂(2H), ethyl CH₂(2H)}. This gives a ttt (triplet of triplets of triplets).\n    *   This molecule produces neither a dtq nor a dtt.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `(CH₃CH₂)(b)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(f)(CH₃)-COOH`\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H(c)**. Its neighbors are: the CH₂(b) group (2H), proton H(f) (1H), and the adjacent CH₃ group (3H).\n    *   Neighbor counts for H(c): **{2H, 1H, 3H}**. This would produce a **tqd** (triplet of quartets of doublets) or **dtq**, depending on the relative coupling constants. This matches the first required signal.\n    *   Now let's search for the **dtt** {1H, 2H, 2H}. A simple analysis of the other protons (H(f), CH₂(b)) does not reveal a dtt pattern.\n\n**Revisiting the Problem and Conclusion**\n\nA rigorous analysis shows that none of the molecules perfectly produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. This suggests a potential typo in the problem description. However, we must choose the best fit. Let's reconsider the possibility. The problem description is highly specific. It is very likely that one of the structures does in fact produce these signals, possibly through a combination of factors like conformation and coupling constants that are not immediately obvious from a simplified analysis.\n\nLet's re-examine molecule C, which is a strong candidate for the `dtq`.\n`CH₃(a)-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(CH₃d)-CH(f)(CH₃e)-COOH`\n- H(c) is coupled to H(f) (1H), CH₂(b) (2H), and CH₃(d) (3H). This is a solid candidate for the **dtq**.\n- Let's reconsider the protons on CH₂(b), Hb' and Hb''. They are diastereotopic. Each is coupled to the three protons of CH₃(a), the single proton H(c), and each other (one proton). This gives a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq).\n\nThere appears to be a contradiction in the problem statement vs. standard analysis. However, if we assume there is an intended answer, we must find the best fit. Let's reconsider the options. Molecule C clearly has a proton (H(c)) with the required neighbors {1H, 2H, 3H} to give a dtq. While the dtt is not obvious, it's possible that complex conformational effects on the CH₂(b) protons could lead to this pattern, or that there is a typo in the question where \"dtt\" should have been another pattern present in C, like \"dq\" (from H(f)). Given that C provides a perfect match for the most complex signal (the dtq), it remains the most plausible candidate.\n\nLet's assume the question is correct. If we carefully re-examine structure C, the proton H(c) is coupled to H(f) (1H), CH3(d) (3H), and CH2(b) (2H), giving the dtq. The other complex signal, the dtt, must come from one of the CH2(b) protons. For one of these protons to be a dtt, it needs neighbours of {1H, 2H, 2H}. It is coupled to its geminal partner (1H) and H(c) (1H) and the CH3(a) group (3H). It seems there is an error in the question, but C is the only compound that contains a proton with neighbours {1H, 2H, 3H} which gives a dtq, and another proton on the alpha-carbon with neighbours {1H, 3H} which gives a dq. Comparing dtq and dq to dtq and dtt, it seems the most plausible option.\n\nFinal decision leans towards C as it's the only one providing a clear origin for the highly specific `dtq` signal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1.

All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all options.\n        *   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This tells us about the neighbors of a specific proton. For a signal to be a `dtq`, the proton must be coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n            *   One neighboring proton (gives the `d` for doublet, n+1=2 -> n=1).\n            *   Two neighboring protons (gives the `t` for triplet, n+1=3 -> n=2).\n            *   Three neighboring protons (gives the `q` for quartet, n+1=4 -> n=3).\n            *   So, we are looking for a proton with 1H, 2H, and 3H as neighbors. The order (`d`, `t`, `q`) depends on the relative size of the coupling constants (J-values), but the set of neighbors is fixed.\n        *   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** Using the same logic:\n            *   One neighboring proton (`d`).\n            *   Two neighboring protons (`t`).\n            *   Another two neighboring protons (`t`).\n            *   So, we are looking for a proton with 1H, 2H, and 2H as neighbors.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Proposed Structure**\n\n    The core of the problem is to see which of the four molecules has protons that match *both* of these complex splitting patterns. We need to draw each structure and analyze the environment of each unique proton (specifically the methine, -CH-, protons as they are most likely to have many different neighbors).\n\n    *   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n        `COOH(1)-CH(Et)(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n        *   Let's analyze H at C3: `...-CH(2)-CH(3)-CH₂(4)-...` and an ethyl group on C3. Its neighbors are: H at C2 (1H), the `CH₂` of the attached ethyl group (2H), and the `CH₂` at C4 (2H).\n        *   Neighbors: 1H, 2H, 2H. This matches the requirement for the **dtt** signal.\n        *   Let's look for a `dtq` (1H, 2H, 3H neighbors). H at C2 has neighbors H-C3 (1H) and `CH₂` of its ethyl group (2H) -> `dt`. The `CH₂` protons in this molecule are diastereotopic and would give `ddq` signals (1H, 1H, 3H neighbors). So, structure A has the `dtt` but not the `dtq`.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        `COOH(1)-CH(Me)(2)-CH(Me)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n        *   Let's analyze H at C3: Its neighbors are: H at C2 (1H), the `CH₃` group on C3 (3H), and the `CH₂` at C4 (2H).\n        *   Neighbors: 1H, 3H, 2H. This matches the requirement for the **dtq** signal.\n        *   Let's look for a `dtt` (1H, 2H, 2H neighbors). No other proton in the molecule has this set of neighbors. H at C2 gives a `dq`. So, structure B has the `dtq` but not the `dtt`.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        `COOH(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Me)(3)-CH(Me)(4)-CH₃(5)`\n        *   H at C3: Neighbors are `CH₂` at C2 (2H), H at C4 (1H), `CH₃` on C3 (3H). This gives a `tdq`.\n        *   H at C4: Neighbors are H at C3 (1H), `CH₃` on C4 (3H), `CH₃` at C5 (3H). This gives a `dqq`.\n        *   This structure has neither a `dtq` nor a `dtt`.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n        Let's draw this carefully:\n        `COOH(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH(Et)(4)-CH₃(5)`\n        This is the correct connectivity based on the condensed formula.\n        Now, let's analyze the two different methine (-CH-) protons.\n        *   **Analyze H at C4:** `...-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH₃(5)` and an ethyl group on C4. Its neighbors are: H at C3 (1H), the `CH₃` group at C5 (3H), and the `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2H).\n        *   Neighbors: 1H, 3H, 2H. This set of neighbors matches the requirement for the **dtq** signal.\n        *   **Analyze H at C3:** `...-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-...` and an ethyl group on C3. Its neighbors are: the `CH₂` group at C2 (2H), H at C4 (1H), and the `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2H).\n        *   Neighbors: 2H, 1H, 2H. This set of neighbors matches the requirement for the **dtt** signal (or more specifically, a `tdt`, but they arise from the same neighbor set of 1H, 2H, 2H).\n\n3.  **Conclusion**\n    Structure C, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is the only compound that contains a proton environment that would produce a `dtq` (the proton at C4) AND another proton environment that would produce a `dtt` (the proton at C3).

It is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n      C₂H₅(d) C₂H₅(c)\n       |       |\nCH₃(e)-CH(b) - CH(a) - CH₂(f) - COOH\n```\nLet's analyze the protons on the main chain, `H(a)` and `H(b)`.\n*   **Proton H(a) (on carbon 3):** This proton is coupled to three distinct neighbors:\n    *   `H(b)` on carbon 4 (1H) → **doublet (d)**\n    *   `CH₂(f)` on carbon 2 (2H) → **triplet (t)**\n    *   `CH₂` of the ethyl group `c` on carbon 3 (2H) → **triplet (t)**\n    This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n*   **Proton H(b) (on carbon 4):** This proton is also coupled to three distinct neighbors:\n    *   `H(a)` on carbon 3 (1H) → **doublet (d)**\n    *   `CH₂` of the ethyl group `d` on carbon 4 (2H) → **triplet (t)**\n    *   `CH₃(e)` on carbon 5 (3H) → **quartet (q)**\n    This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second observed signal.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure D is the only one that can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Final Identification**\n\nThe FTIR and ¹H NMR data are fully consistent with the structure of 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, which is represented by the formula `CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1.

A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nLet's break down what these splitting patterns mean in terms of neighboring protons:\n*   **Doublet of Triplets of Quartets (dtq):** For a proton to be split into a dtq, it must be coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (CH) to cause the **doublet (d)** splitting (n+1 = 1+1=2).\n    *   A set of two equivalent protons (a CH₂ group) to cause the **triplet (t)** splitting (n+1 = 2+1=3).\n    *   A set of three equivalent protons (a CH₃ group) to cause the **quartet (q)** splitting (n+1 = 3+1=4).\n*   **Doublet of Triplets of Triplets (dtt):** For a proton to be split into a dtt, it must be coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (CH) to cause the **doublet (d)** splitting (n+1 = 1+1=2).\n    *   A set of two equivalent protons (a CH₂ group) to cause one **triplet (t)** splitting (n+1 = 2+1=3).\n    *   Another, chemically non-equivalent set of two protons (another CH₂ group) to cause the second **triplet (t)** splitting.\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nNow we must examine each of the four proposed structures to see which one has protons in the specific environments required to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. The condensed formulas are written ambiguously, so we will interpret them into their most likely IUPAC structures.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   This structure has a proton at C3 that could be a `dtq`, but it lacks a proton that could be a `dtt`.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   This structure has a proton at C3 that could be a `dtt`, but it lacks a proton that could be a `dtq`.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   This structure has a proton at C3 that could be a `dtq`, but it lacks a proton that could be a `dtt`.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n    *   Let's interpret the ambiguous formula as `(CH₃)(C₂H₅)CH-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`. The longest carbon chain containing the COOH group determines the parent name. This chain is 6 carbons long (hexanoic acid), with a methyl group at C4 and an ethyl group at C3.\n    *   **Structure:**\n        ```\n                      CH₃ (methyl on C4)\n                      |\n        CH₃-CH₂-CH-CH-CH₂-COOH\n                         |\n                         CH₂CH₃ (ethyl on C3)\n        Carbon number: 6   5   4  3  2    1\n        ```\n    *   **Let's check for the `dtt` signal:**\n        *   Consider the proton on **C3**.\n        *   Its neighbors are: the proton on C4 (1H), the protons on C2 (2H), and the protons on the ethyl group's CH₂ (2H).\n        *   Splitting: `doublet` (from C4-H) of `triplets` (from C2-H₂) of `triplets` (from ethyl-H₂).\n        *   This proton gives a **dtt** signal.\n\n    *   **Let's check for the `dtq` signal:**\n        *   Consider the proton on **C4**.\n        *   Its neighbors are: the proton on C3 (1H), the protons on C5 (2H), and the protons of the methyl group at C4 (3H).\n        *   Splitting: `doublet` (from C3-H) of `triplets` (from C5-H₂) of `quartets` (from methyl-H₃).\n        *   This proton gives a **dtq** signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe structure corresponding to option C, **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**, is the only one that contains both a proton environment that would result in a `doublet of triplets of triplets` and a different proton environment that would result in a `doublet of triplets of quartets`. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The peak is characteristically very broad, often spanning from ~2500 cm⁻¹ to ~3300 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. A value around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the carbonyl group in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them. We must use the NMR data to differentiate them.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe crucial information lies in the complex splitting patterns observed for two different signals:\n*   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nThe multiplicity of a proton's signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (n) according to the n+1 rule. For complex splitting, we consider each group of neighboring protons separately.\n*   Doublet (d): Coupling to 1 neighboring proton.\n*   Triplet (t): Coupling to 2 neighboring protons.\n*   Quartet (q): Coupling to 3 neighboring protons.\n\nTherefore:\n*   **dtq** implies a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one group with 1 proton, one group with 2 protons, and one group with 3 protons.\n*   **dtt** implies a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one group with 1 proton, one group with 2 protons, and another group with 2 protons.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each option to see which one would produce both of these signals. We'll determine the IUPAC name for each condensed formula to have a clear structure.\n\n---\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid**\n`COOH(1)-CH(a)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₂(c)-CH₃(d)`\n*   Let's analyze the proton `H(b)`. It is coupled to `H(a)` (1 neighbor), the `CH₂(c)` group (2 neighbors), and its attached `CH₃` group... wait, no. Vicinal coupling is to neighbors on adjacent carbons. So, `H(b)` is coupled to `H(a)` (1H) and `CH₂(c)` (2H). There is also a methyl group on the same carbon, but that is not vicinal coupling. Let's re-read the structure, the formula must be `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. The chain is 6 carbons long. Let's draw it and label the protons.\n`CH₃(d)-CH₂(c)-CH(b)(CH₃(f))-CH(a)(CH₃(e))-COOH`\n*   **`H(b)`:** Coupled to `H(a)` (1H), `CH₂(c)` (2H), and the protons of the methyl group `CH₃(f)` (3H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This would result in a **dtq** signal. So, this molecule has a `dtq` signal.\n*   **`dtt` signal?** A `dtt` requires (1H, 2H, 2H) neighbors. No proton in this molecule has this combination of neighbors. Thus, compound A is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(d)-CH₂(c)-CH(b)(C₂H₅(g))-CH(a)(C₂H₅(f))-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze the proton `H(b)`. It is coupled to `H(a)` (1H), the `CH₂(c)` group (2H), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl substituent `C₂H₅(g)` (2H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 2H). This would result in a **dtt** signal. So, this molecule has a `dtt` signal.\n*   **`dtq` signal?** A `dtq` requires (1H, 2H, 3H) neighbors. No proton in this molecule has this specific combination. For example, the diastereotopic protons of `CH₂(c)` are coupled to `H(b)` (1H), `CH₃(d)` (3H), and each other (1H), which would give a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq), not a `dtq`. Thus, compound C is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(d)-CH(c)(CH₃(f))-CH(b)(CH₃(e))-CH₂(a)-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze the proton `H(b)`. It is coupled to `H(c)` (1H), the `CH₂(a)` group (2H), and the protons of its methyl substituent `CH₃(e)` (3H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This would result in a **dtq** signal.\n*   **`dtt` signal?** A `dtt` requires (1H, 2H, 2H) neighbors. No proton in this molecule has this combination. Thus, compound D is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(d)-CH(c)(C₂H₅(g))-CH(b)(C₂H₅(f))-CH₂(a)-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze proton **`H(b)`**. It is coupled to the `CH₂(a)` group (2H), `H(c)` (1H), and the `CH₂` protons of its ethyl substituent `C₂H₅(f)` (2H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 2H). This proton would show a **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets) splitting pattern. **This matches one of the required signals.**\n*   Let's analyze proton **`H(c)`**. It is coupled to `H(b)` (1H), the `CH₃(d)` group (3H), and the `CH₂` protons of its ethyl substituent `C₂H₅(g)` (2H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This proton would show a **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets) splitting pattern. **This matches the other required signal.**\n\nConclusion: Compound B is the only structure that has one proton (`H(b)`) that would produce a `dtt` signal and another proton (`H(c)`) that would produce a `dtq` signal.

Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in interpreting the complex splitting patterns described. The multiplicity of a signal is given by the `n+1` rule, where `n` is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons, the splitting pattern becomes a \"multiplet of multiplets.\"\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighbors.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** It's coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** It's coupled to a group of two neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** It's coupled to a group of three neighboring protons (n=3).\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a different proton is also being split by three different groups of neighbors.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** It's coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** It's coupled to a group of two neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Another Triplet (t):** It's coupled to another, different group of two neighboring protons (n=2).\n\nThese highly complex splitting patterns typically arise from methine protons (CH) in a complex, chiral environment. We must now examine the structure of each option to see which one contains protons that would produce these specific signals.\n\n**3.

All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group is present in all candidates but doesn't help distinguish between them.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving the problem lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The \"n+1\" rule states that a proton signal is split into n+1 lines by n equivalent neighboring protons. A complex splitting pattern like \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" means a single proton is being coupled by three different groups of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a proton is coupled to:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving a **d**oublet, 1+1=2 lines).\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (giving a **t**riplet, 2+1=3 lines).\n        *   A group of three equivalent neighboring protons (giving a **q**uartet, 3+1=4 lines).\n    *   For this to occur, a methine proton (-CH-) must be adjacent to another methine group (-CH-), a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a proton is coupled to:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving a **d**oublet, 1+1=2 lines).\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (giving a **t**riplet, 2+1=3 lines).\n        *   Another different group of two equivalent neighboring protons (giving another **t**riplet, 2+1=3 lines).\n    *   For this to occur, a methine proton (-CH-) must be adjacent to another methine group (-CH-), a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a second, non-equivalent methylene group (-CH₂-).\n\nThe problem states that the compound's spectrum contains **both** of these signals. We must find the molecule that has two different protons matching these descriptions.\n\n### **3.

Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe most distinguishing information comes from the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds. All four structures are saturated, which is consistent with this data.\n*   **Key Signals:** The spectrum contains two particularly complex signals:\n    *   **Signal 1:** A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   **Signal 2:** A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nTo have these multiplicities, a proton must be coupled to three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups of protons.\n*   A **dtq** arises from a proton being split by:\n    *   One adjacent proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n    *   A group of two adjacent protons (like a CH₂ group), giving the **t**riplet.\n    *   A group of three adjacent protons (like a CH₃ group), giving the **q**uartet.\n*   A **dtt** arises from a proton being split by:\n    *   One adjacent proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n    *   A group of two adjacent protons (like a CH₂ group), giving the first **t**riplet.\n    *   Another, different group of two adjacent protons (another CH₂ group), giving the second **t**riplet.\n\n### **3. Analyze Each Candidate Structure**\n\nWe need to find the structure that contains one proton environment that would produce a `dtq` and another that would produce a `dtt`. Let's represent the structures by their IUPAC names derived from the condensed formulas.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(CH₃)(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), H at C4 (2H, triplet), and the C3-methyl (3H, quartet). This proton would be a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to three neighbors consisting of one proton, two protons, and another two protons. Therefore, there is no `dtt` signal. Structure A is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH(CH₃)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet), H at C2 (2H, triplet), and the C3-methyl (3H, quartet). This proton would be a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   Like structure A, there is no proton environment that would lead to a `dtt` signal. Structure C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH(Et)(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), H at C4 (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This proton would be a **dtt**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **H at C2**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **dt** (doublet of triplets), not a `dtq`. Since there is no `dtq` signal, structure D is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH(Et)(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    Let's examine the two methine (CH) protons on the main chain, at C3 and C4.\n    *   **Proton at C4**: It is adjacent to three different groups of protons:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → doublet (d)\n        2.  The protons of the ethyl group at C4 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        3.  The protons of the methyl group at C5 (3H) → quartet (q)\n        The multiplicity is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **Proton at C3**: It is also adjacent to three different groups of protons:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → doublet (d)\n        2.  The protons of the CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        3.  The protons of the ethyl group at C3 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        The multiplicity is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n\n**Conclusion:** Structure B is the only candidate that has protons matching both the `dtq` and `dtt` signals described in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to be very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all candidates but does not distinguish between them.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data - The Splitting Patterns**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the 1H NMR spectrum. We need to find the molecule that has protons with the specific environments required to produce these signals.\n\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a single proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups of protons.\n    *   `doublet (d)`: implies coupling to **one** neighboring proton (n=1, n+1=2).\n    *   `triplet (t)`: implies coupling to **two** equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3).\n    *   `quartet (q)`: implies coupling to **three** equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, n+1=4).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton (let's call it Hx) with this specific neighborhood: `-CHx - CH(1H) - CH2(2H) - CH3(3H)`. The order `d`, `t`, `q` depends on the relative size of the coupling constants (J-values), so a `dqt`, `tdq`, or `qdt` all point to the same arrangement of neighbors.\n\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a single proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups of protons.\n    *   `doublet (d)`: implies coupling to **one** neighboring proton.\n    *   `triplet (t)`: implies coupling to **two** equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   `triplet (t)`: implies coupling to another, different group of **two** equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton (let's call it Hy) with this specific neighborhood: `-CHy - CH(1H) - CH2(2H) - CH2(2H)`.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Each Candidate Molecule**\n\nLet's examine the structure of each candidate to see if any proton matches the required environments for a `dtt` and a `dtq`. We'll focus on the methine (CH) protons, as they are most likely to have multiple distinct neighbors. For simplicity in this initial analysis, we will treat protons on a `CH2` group as equivalent, which gives rise to triplets in neighboring protons (this is a standard simplifying assumption in introductory NMR, although in reality they are often diastereotopic and give more complex patterns).\n\n**A) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH2-CH(b)(CH3)-CH(c)(CH3)2`\n*   H(b) is adjacent to a CH2 (2H), a CH(c) (1H), and a CH3 (3H). This matches the neighbor requirement (1H, 2H, 3H) for a **dtq** (or tdq).\n*   No proton in this molecule is adjacent to two different CH2 groups. Therefore, it **cannot produce a dtt** signal.\n\n**B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH → 3-ethyl-5-methylhexanoic acid (based on plausible parsing)**\n`HOOC-CH2-CH(b)(C2H5)-CH2-CH(d)(CH3)2`\n*   H(b) is adjacent to three CH2 groups. It would be a `ttt` (triplet of triplets of triplets), not a `dtt`.\n*   This structure does not fit the data.\n\n**C) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3CH2(i)-CH(b)(C2H5)-CH(a)(C2H5)-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze proton H(b) on carbon 3. It is adjacent to:\n    1.  The H(a) proton on carbon 2 (**1H**). This causes a `doublet`.\n    2.  The CH2 group of the ethyl side-chain on carbon 3 (**2H**). This causes a `triplet`.\n    3.  The CH2(i) group on carbon 4 of the main chain (**2H**). This causes another `triplet`.\n*   This environment (neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 2H) is a perfect match for a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   Now let's check for a dtq. A proton in one of the diastereotopic CH2 groups, for example in the C2-ethyl group `CH(a)-CH2(f)-CH3(g)`, would be coupled to its geminal partner (1H), the vicinal H(a) (1H), and the vicinal CH3 (3H). This would give a `ddq` (doublet of doublets of quartets), not a `dtq`. However, given that this is the only molecule that can produce the highly specific `dtt` signal, we can be confident this is the correct structure. The `dtq` mentioned might be a description of a complex multiplet that appears like a `dtq` or it's possible that this compound has a signal that fits `dtq` due to other factors.\n\n**D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3CH2(g)-CH(b)(CH3)-CH(a)(CH3)-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze proton H(b) on carbon 3. It is adjacent to:\n    1.  The H(a) proton on carbon 2 (**1H**). `doublet`.\n    2.  The CH2(g) group on carbon 4 (**2H**). `triplet`.\n    3.  The methyl (CH3) group on carbon 3 (**3H**). `quartet`.\n*   This environment (neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 3H) is a perfect match for a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   However, let's check for a `dtt`. No proton in this molecule is adjacent to two different CH2 groups. Therefore, it **cannot produce a dtt** signal.\n\n### **Step 4: Conclusion**\n\n*   Molecule **C** is the only candidate that possesses the structural features to produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** signal.\n*   Molecule **D** is the only candidate that possesses the structural features to produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** signal.\n\nSince the problem states that the NMR spectrum shows *both* a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal, and they are from different protons, there appears to be a contradiction if we strictly follow the simplified analysis for both signals. However, the requirement for a `dtt` signal is structurally very constrained. Only a proton neighbored by a CH, a CH2, and another CH2 can produce this pattern. Only molecule **C** has this feature. The `dtt` is the more definitive and uncommon pattern. Therefore, the compound must be **C**. The signal described as a `dtq` must also arise from this molecule, likely from a more complex multiplet (like a `ddq`) that is being described this way.\n\nThe presence of the `dtt` signal is the deciding piece of evidence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated, which is consistent with this information.\n    *   **Key Information:** The spectrum contains two very specific and complex signals:\n        1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n        2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Splitting Patterns:**\n    The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of neighboring protons (n) according to the n+1 rule. For coupling to multiple, non-equivalent groups of protons, the multiplicities are multiplied.\n    *   **dtq (doublet of triplets of quartets):** This means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (d, doublet).\n        *   A group of two equivalent protons (t, triplet).\n        *   A group of three equivalent protons (q, quartet).\n        This pattern arises from a proton in a `CH` group that is adjacent to another `CH` group, a `CH2` group, and a `CH3` group.\n    *   **dtt (doublet of triplets of triplets):** This means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (d, doublet).\n        *   A group of two equivalent protons (t, triplet).\n        *   A *different* group of two equivalent protons (t, triplet).\n        This pattern arises from a proton in a `CH` group that is adjacent to another `CH` group, a `CH2` group, and another `CH2` group (e.g., in an ethyl group).\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Structure (using a first-order approximation):**\n\n    *   **A) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH -> 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        ` (CH3)2CH(4)-CH(3)(CH3)-CH2(2)-COOH `\n        The proton on C3 is coupled to H on C4 (1H, gives a doublet), the `CH2` on C2 (2H, gives a triplet), and the `CH3` on C3 (3H, gives a quartet). This produces a **dtq**. However, there is no proton environment that would produce a `dtt`.\n\n    *   **B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH -> 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid**\n        ` CH3CH2(4)-CH(3)(C2H5)-CH(2)(C2H5)-COOH `\n        The proton on C3 is coupled to H on C2 (1H, doublet), the `CH2` on C4 (2H, triplet), and the `CH2` of the ethyl group attached to C3 (2H, triplet). This produces a **dtt**. However, there is no proton environment that would produce a `dtq`.\n\n    *   **C) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH -> 3,5-diethylhexanoic acid**\n        ` CH3-CH(5)(Et)-CH2(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH2(2)-COOH `\n        The methine protons on C3 and C5 are only adjacent to `CH2` groups. Their signals would not start with a doublet. For example, the proton on C3 is coupled to three different `CH2` groups, which would result in a triplet of triplets of triplets (`ttt`). This does not match.\n\n    *   **D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH -> 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        ` CH3CH2(4)-CH(3)(CH3)-CH(2)(CH3)-COOH `\n        Let's analyze the methine proton on C3.\n        *   It is adjacent to the methine proton (`CH`) on C2. This coupling gives a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the methylene protons (`CH2`) on C4. This coupling gives a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the methyl protons (`CH3`) also on C3. This coupling gives a **quartet (q)**.\n        *   Combining these gives a signal that is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first piece of NMR data.\n        *   Now, let's look for a `dtt` signal. No other proton in this molecule fits the neighbor requirement (1H, 2H, 2H) to produce a `dtt` based on a first-order analysis.\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Resolution:**\n    Based on a standard (first-order) analysis of the structures:\n    *   Molecule D (and A) produces a `dtq`.\n    *   Molecule B produces a `dtt`.\n    *   No single molecule appears to produce both signals.\n\n    This suggests a possible issue with the problem statement or that a more complex NMR effect (like diastereotopicity leading to an unusual apparent pattern) is at play. However, in such problems, we must select the best fit. The `dtq` signal from the proton at C3 in structure D is a textbook example matching the environment `CH2-CH(CH3)-CH`. This provides a very strong match for one of the two unique signals described. No other molecule provides such a clear-cut explanation for this specific and highly complex pattern while also being a plausible candidate for the other complex patterns that can arise from its structure (e.g., diastereotopic protons). Given that molecule D perfectly explains the very complex `dtq` signal, it is the most likely candidate, even with the ambiguity surrounding the `dtt` signal (which might arise from a misinterpretation of a complex multiplet or a non-ideal spectrum).\n\nTherefore, compound D is the most logical choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid. The peak is broad due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.

Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four options are saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids, which is consistent with this information.\n*   **Key splitting patterns:** The most crucial pieces of information are the complex splitting patterns observed for two different signals:\n    *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n**3. Decoding the Splitting Patterns**\n\nThe multiplicity of a signal is given by the (n+1) rule, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. A complex splitting pattern like a \"doublet of triplets\" means the proton is being split by two different, non-equivalent groups of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** For a proton to show this pattern, it must be coupled to three different neighboring groups of protons:\n    *   A group with 1 proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A group with 2 protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   A group with 3 protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n    This implies a methine (CH) proton must be adjacent to a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** For a proton to show this pattern, it must be coupled to three different neighboring groups of protons:\n    *   A group with 1 proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A group with 2 protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   Another, chemically different group with 2 protons (n=2, gives another triplet).\n    This implies a methine (CH) proton must be adjacent to a CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nThe chemical formulas in the options contain pentavalent carbons, which is impossible. This indicates a typo.

This would produce a `dtt` signal. However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group simultaneously, so there would be no `dtq` signal.\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid.** This structure does not have any protons that would give a `dtq` or `dtt` signal. The most complex signal would be a doublet of triplets.\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid.**\n    Let's draw this structure and analyze the key protons.\n    `                      CH₃(g) `\n    `                       | `\n    ` CH₃(f) - CH₂(d) - CH(c) - CH(b)(CH₂(e)CH₃(e')) - CH₂(a) - COOH `\n\n    *   **Analyze the proton on C3 (Hᵇ):**\n        *   It is adjacent to C2, which has a CH₂ group (2 protons, Hᵃ).

This matches the other observed signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option C, **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**, has protons that match both of the complex splitting patterns (`dtt` and `dtq`) described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness is a key indicator.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for a carboxylic acid (usually around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.

Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to identifying the specific structure lies in the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the signals described.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four proposed structures are saturated alkanoic acids, consistent with this information.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern tells us that a single proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** means it's coupled to **one** neighboring proton (n+1 = 2, so n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** means it's coupled to **two** neighboring protons (n+1 = 3, so n=2).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** means it's coupled to **three** neighboring protons (n+1 = 4, so n=3).\n    Therefore, the proton giving the `dtq` signal must be adjacent to a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern means a single proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** means it's coupled to **one** neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** means it's coupled to **two** neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** means it's coupled to another, different group of **two** neighboring protons (n=2).\n    Therefore, the proton giving the `dtt` signal must be adjacent to a CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n### 3.

All four candidate structures are saturated, so this is consistent with all of them.\n    *   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This splitting pattern arises from a single proton that is coupled to three different, adjacent groups of protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (like a -CH₂- group), giving the **t**riplet.\n        *   A group of three equivalent neighboring protons (like a -CH₃ group), giving the **q**uartet.\n        So, we are looking for a proton in a `CH-CH(R)-CH₂` environment, where the carbon atom also has a methyl group attached: `CH₃-C*(H)-CH-CH₂`.\n    *   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This splitting pattern arises from a single proton that is coupled to three different, adjacent groups of protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (a -CH₂- group), giving the first **t**riplet.\n        *   Another, chemically non-equivalent group of two neighboring protons (another -CH₂- group), giving the second **t**riplet.\n        So, we are looking for a proton in a `CH-C*(H)-CH₂` environment, where the carbon atom is also attached to another group containing a `CH₂` (like an ethyl group): `CH₂-C*(H)(R)-CH`, where R is `CH₂CH₃`. The complete fragment would look like `CH₂-C*(H)(CH₂CH₃)-CH`.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Candidate Structures\n\nNow we need to examine each of the four possible structures to see which one would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nFirst, let's correctly identify the IUPAC names for the given condensed formulas.

This creates a **dtq**.\n    *   **Proton H(a) at C4:** Neighbors are `H(b)` (1H), the `-CH₃` on C4 (3H), and the `-CH₃` at C5 (3H). This creates a doublet of quartets of quartets (`dqq`), not a `dtt`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This molecule does not have a proton that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₃CH₂-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH(a)(CH₃)-COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(b) at C3:** Neighbors are `H(a)` (1H), the `-CH₂-` of the ethyl group (2H), and the `-CH₃` at C3 (3H). This creates a **dtq**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in the structure adjacent to a `-CH-` and two different `-CH₂-` groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This molecule does not have a proton that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₃CH₂-CH(b)(C₂H₅)-CH(a)(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(b) at C3:** Neighbors are `H(a)` (1H), the `-CH₂-` from the main chain at C4 (2H), and the `-CH₂-` of the ethyl group at C3 (2H). This creates a **dtt**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in the structure adjacent to a `-CH-`, a `-CH₂-`, and a `-CH₃` group to create a `dtq`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This molecule does not have a proton that would produce a `dtq` signal.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nOnly **structure A (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)** has protons in environments that would produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets AND a doublet of triplets of triplets. Therefore, this is the correct identity of the unknown compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, consistent with a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the class of compound but doesn't differentiate between the choices.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns described.\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four structures are saturated, so this is consistent with all options.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This means a single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A set of one proton (n=1), leading to a doublet (1+1=2).\n    *   A set of two protons (n=2), leading to a triplet (2+1=3).\n    *   A set of three protons (n=3), leading to a quartet (3+1=4).\n    *   The total number of neighboring protons for this signal is 1 + 2 + 3 = **6**.\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means a different single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A set of one proton (n=1), leading to a doublet (1+1=2).\n    *   A set of two protons (n=2), leading to a triplet (2+1=3).\n    *   Another set of two protons (n=2), leading to a triplet (2+1=3).\n    *   The total number of neighboring protons for this signal is 1 + 2 + 2 = **5**.\n\nOur task is to find the structure that has two specific methine (C-H) protons with exactly these environments.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Candidate Structure\n\nWe will now analyze the protons on the chiral centers (methine protons) for each option. We will assume the n+1 rule applies and that the COOH proton does not couple.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`CH₃(a)-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(CH₃(e))-CH(d)(CH₃(f))-COOH`\n*   **H(c):** This proton is coupled to the `CH₂(b)` group (2 protons, gives a triplet), the `H(d)` proton (1 proton, gives a doublet), and the `CH₃(e)` group (3 protons, gives a quartet). Total neighbors = 2+1+3 = 6. The pattern is a **tdq** (or **dtq**). This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **H(d):** This proton is coupled to the `H(c)` proton (1 proton, gives a doublet) and the `CH₃(f)` group (3 protons, gives a quartet). Total neighbors = 1+3 = 4. The pattern is a **dq**. This does not match the `dtt` signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure A is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`CH₃(a)-CH(b)(CH₃(e))-CH(c)(CH₃(f))-CH₂(d)-COOH`\n*   **H(b):** Coupled to `CH₃(a)` (3H, quartet), `H(c)` (1H, doublet), and `CH₃(e)` (3H, quartet). Total neighbors = 3+1+3 = 7. The pattern is a **qdq**. This matches neither required signal.\n*   **H(c):** Coupled to `H(b)` (1H, doublet), `CH₂(d)` (2H, triplet), and `CH₃(f)` (3H, quartet). Total neighbors = 1+2+3 = 6. The pattern is a **dtq**. This matches one signal, but the other signal (`qdq`) is wrong.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure D is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nLet Et = CH₂CH₃.\n`CH₃(a)-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(Et)-CH(d)(Et)-COOH`\n*   **H(c):** Coupled to `CH₂(b)` (2H, triplet), `H(d)` (1H, doublet), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). Total neighbors = 2+1+2 = 5. The pattern is a **tdt** (or **dtt**). This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **H(d):** Coupled to `H(c)` (1H, doublet) and the `CH₂` of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). Total neighbors = 1+2 = 3. The pattern is a **dt**. This does not match the `dtq` signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure C is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nThis formula is best interpreted as the structure for 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid.\nLet Et = CH₂CH₃.\n`CH₃(a)-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH₂(d)-COOH`\nLet's analyze the methine protons, H(b) and H(c).\n*   **H(b) (on C4):** This proton is coupled to the `CH₃(a)` group (3 protons, gives a quartet), the `H(c)` proton (1 proton, gives a doublet), and the `CH₂` of its own ethyl group (2 protons, gives a triplet). Total neighbors = 3+1+2 = 6. The pattern is a **qdt** (which is the same as a **dtq**). **This is a match.**\n*   **H(c) (on C3):** This proton is coupled to the `H(b)` proton (1 proton, gives a doublet), the `CH₂(d)` group (2 protons, gives a triplet), and the `CH₂` of its own ethyl group (2 protons, gives a triplet). Total neighbors = 1+2+2 = 5. The pattern is a **dtt**. **This is also a match.**\n\n**Conclusion:** Structure B is the only one that has a proton environment corresponding to a `dtq` signal and another proton environment corresponding to a `dtt` signal.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Compound B is 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid.\n*   Its FTIR spectrum would show broad O-H and strong C=O absorptions, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   Its ¹H NMR spectrum would not show vinyl protons.\n*   Its ¹H NMR spectrum would contain a proton (H at C4) with a `dtq` splitting pattern.\n*   Its ¹H NMR spectrum would contain a proton (H at C3) with a `dtt` splitting pattern.\nAll pieces of experimental data point to this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer, where the broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the options. The final identification must come from the ¹H NMR data.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in deciphering the complex splitting patterns described. A signal's multiplicity is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons according to the n+1 rule. For complex splitting, we consider each group of neighboring protons separately.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This tells us that the proton responsible for this signal is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1)\n    *   Two neighboring protons (giving the **t**riplet, n=2)\n    *   Three neighboring protons (giving the **q**uartet, n=3)\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    This tells us that the proton responsible for this signal is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1)\n    *   Two neighboring protons (giving the first **t**riplet, n=2)\n    *   Another, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (giving the second **t**riplet, n=2)\n\nNow, we must examine the structure of each option to see which one contains protons with the required sets of neighbors. The most likely candidates for such complex splitting are the methine protons (CH) at the chiral centers.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's determine the IUPAC name for each formula to avoid ambiguity and analyze its structure. The main chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the carboxyl group.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   `CH₃(g)CH₂(f)-CH(e)(CH₃)d-CH(b)(CH₃)c-COOH(a)`\n    *   Proton **H_e** (at C3) is coupled to H_b (1H), H_f (2H), and H_d (3H). This would give a **dqt**, matching one of the signals.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to sets of 1H, 2H, and 2H neighbors to give a **dtt**. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   `(CH₃)₂CH(c)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₂(a)-COOH`\n    *   Proton **H_b** (at C3) is coupled to H_a (2H), H_c (1H), and the methyl protons on C3 (3H). This gives a **tqd** (or **dtq**), matching one signal.\n    *   Again, there is no proton that would give a **dtt**. So, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H), the CH₂ of the ethyl at C3 (2H), and the CH₂ of the main chain at C4 (2H). This gives a **dtt**, matching one signal.\n    *   However, no proton has the correct combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) to produce a **dtq**. The methylene protons in the ethyl and pentyl chains will give `ddq` patterns. So, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n    Let's parse this formula: `[CH₃]-[CH(C₂H₅)]-[CH(C₂H₅)]-[CH₂COOH]`\n    The longest chain containing the COOH group makes this a hexanoic acid derivative. Its name is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n    Let's draw and label the key protons on the backbone:\n    \n          CH₃(a)    Et(f)\n          |         |\n    CH₃CH₂(c)-CH(b) - CH(e) - CH₂(d) - COOH\n\n    *   **Analyze proton H_b (at C4):**\n        *   It is coupled to the single proton **H_e** (1H) → doublet.\n        *   It is coupled to the methylene protons **H_c** (2H) → triplet.\n        *   It is coupled to the methyl protons **H_a** (3H) → quartet.\n        *   The resulting signal for H_b is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal description.\n\n    *   **Analyze proton H_e (at C3):**\n        *   It is coupled to the single proton **H_b** (1H) → doublet.\n        *   It is coupled to the methylene protons **H_d** (2H) → triplet.\n        *   It is coupled to the methylene protons of its ethyl group, **H_f** (2H) → triplet.\n        *   The resulting signal for H_e is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal description.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStructure D, which is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, is the only compound that has protons matching both of the complex splitting patterns observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, where the broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group present but does not differentiate between the choices.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated carboxylic acids, consistent with this information.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a single proton is coupled to three different neighboring groups of protons:\n        *   A group with 1 proton (giving the doublet, `d`).\n        *   A group with 2 protons (giving the triplet, `t`).\n        *   A group with 3 protons (giving the quartet, `q`).\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different single proton is coupled to three different neighboring groups of protons:\n        *   A group with 1 proton (giving the doublet, `d`).\n        *   A group with 2 protons (giving the first triplet, `t`).\n        *   Another group with 2 protons (giving the second triplet, `t`).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Structure Based on the Splitting Patterns:**\n    The key to solving this problem is to find a structure that contains one proton environment matching the `dtq` pattern and another proton environment matching the `dtt` pattern. Let's analyze the structures derived from the provided condensed formulas. Note that these formulas can be ambiguous, so we will deduce the most plausible structures. The letter options (A, B, C, D) correspond to the order in the question.\n\n    *   **Structure A: `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH`**\n        This likely represents `3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid`, but has the wrong atom count. If we assume a typo and it represents a C8 acid like `3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid` (`CH3CH2-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-CH2-COOH`), we can analyze its methine (`CH`) protons. Each methine proton is coupled to another methine (1H, `d`), a methylene (2H, `t`), and a methyl (3H, `q`). Both methine protons would be a `dtq`. This structure does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n    *   **Structure B: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\n        This likely represents a molecule with a `-CH2COOH` end and ethyl branches. The most direct interpretation is `3,4-diethylhexanoic acid` (C10, too large). If we analyze the proton topology, we find two methine protons, each coupled to another methine (1H, `d`) and two different methylene groups (2H, `t` and 2H, `t`). This structure would exhibit two `dtt` signals, but no `dtq` signal.\n\n    *   **Structure C: `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH`**\n        This most likely represents `2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid` (C7). Assuming a typo for a C8 acid like `2,3-dimethylhexanoic acid` (`CH3CH2CH2-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-COOH`), let's analyze the methine protons.\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H, `d`), the `CH2` group at C4 (2H, `t`), and its own methyl branch (3H, `q`). This proton would be a **`dtq`**.\n        *   However, this structure lacks a proton coupled to one `CH` and two `CH2` groups, so it would not show a `dtt` signal.\n\n    *   **Structure D: `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH`**\n        This formula most plausibly represents **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**. Let's draw it and number the carbons, starting from the carboxyl group.\n        ```\n              Et (branch on C3)\n               |\n        CH3(5)-CH2(4)-CH(3)-CH(2)-COOH\n                             |\n                            Et (branch on C2)\n        ```\n        Let's analyze the methine (`CH`) protons at positions 2 and 3.\n        *   **Proton at C3 (H3):** This proton is coupled to:\n            1.  The proton at C2 (a `CH` group, 1H) -> `doublet (d)`\n            2.  The protons on C4 (a `CH2` group, 2H) -> `triplet (t)`\n            3.  The protons on the `CH2` of its own ethyl branch (a `CH2` group, 2H) -> `triplet (t)`\n            Therefore, the signal for H3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the signals described in the problem.\n\n        *   **Proton at C2 (H2):** This proton is coupled to:\n            1.  The proton at C3 (a `CH` group, 1H) -> `doublet (d)`\n            2.  The protons on the `CH2` of its ethyl branch (a `CH2` group, 2H) -> `triplet (t)`\n            The signal for H2 is a `doublet of triplets (dt)`.\n\n        *   Now, let's search for the `dtq` signal. A `dtq` signal requires a proton coupled to a 1H, a 2H, and a 3H group. In this molecule, there are no methine protons coupled to a methyl group. Let's check the methylene protons. For instance, a proton on the `CH2` at C4 is coupled to H3 (1H, `d`), the `CH3` at C5 (3H, `q`), and its geminal partner (1H, `d`). This results in a `qdd` (quartet of doublet of doublets), not a `dtq`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Of the four options, only structure D (`2,3-diethylpentanoic acid`) possesses the necessary arrangement of neighboring protons to produce a **`dtt`** signal for one of its methine protons. While finding the `dtq` is not straightforward from a simple analysis (it may arise from a more complex interaction or there could be a slight error in the problem's description), the presence of the very specific `dtt` pattern is a strong and unambiguous indicator for structure D. None of the other structures can produce a `dtt` signal. Therefore, this must be the correct compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding. The broadness is a key characteristic.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This frequency is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), so this information is consistent with all candidates but doesn't differentiate between them.\n\n### **2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe most crucial information comes from the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the signals in the 1H NMR spectrum. The splitting of a proton's signal is determined by its non-equivalent neighboring protons (the n+1 rule). When a proton is coupled to multiple, different groups of protons, its signal becomes a multiplet of multiplets.\n\nWe are given two specific, complex signals:\n1.  **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n2.  **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nLet's break down what these patterns mean in terms of neighboring protons:\n*   **dtq (doublet of triplets of quartets):** The proton giving this signal must be adjacent to three different groups of protons:\n    *   A group with **1** proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A group with **2** equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   A group with **3** equivalent protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n    *   **Total neighbors:** 1H, 2H, and 3H.\n*   **dtt (doublet of triplets of triplets):** The proton giving this signal must be adjacent to three different groups of protons:\n    *   A group with **1** proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A group with **2** equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   Another, different group with **2** equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   **Total neighbors:** 1H, 2H, and 2H.\n\nThe correct compound must have protons in environments that match **both** of these descriptions.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nFirst, let's clarify the structures from the condensed formulas, assuming they represent valid chain structures.\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2CH(C2H5)CH(C2H5)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   **B) CH3CH(C2H5)CH(C2H5)CH2COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   **C) CH3CH2CH(CH3)CH(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   **D) CH3CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH2COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n\nNow, let's analyze the methine (CH) protons in each structure, as they are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n*(Note: For this analysis, we will make a common simplification that the two protons of a CH₂ group in an ethyl or propyl chain are equivalent, even if they are technically diastereotopic due to nearby chiral centers. The observation of clean multiplets suggests this is a valid approximation here.)*\n\n---\n#### **Analysis of C: 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3-CH2-CH(c)-CH(b)-COOH`\n         `|      |`\n         `CH3    CH3`\n*   **Proton H(b):** Is next to H(c) (1H) and a CH₃ group (3H). Its neighbors are (1H, 3H), so its signal would be a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This doesn't match.\n*   **Proton H(c):** Is next to H(b) (1H), a CH₂ group (2H), and a CH₃ group (3H). Its neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H), so its signal would be a **dtq**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** This molecule can produce a `dtq`, but it has no proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) to produce a `dtt`. So, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n#### **Analysis of D: 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3-CH(e)-CH(d)-CH2-COOH`\n     `|      |`\n     `CH3    CH3`\n*   **Proton H(d):** Is next to H(e) (1H), a CH₂ group (2H), and a CH₃ group (3H). Its neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H), so its signal would be a **dtq**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **Proton H(e):** Is next to H(d) (1H) and two different CH₃ groups (3H + 3H = 6H). Its neighbors are (1H, 6H), so its signal would be a **doublet of septets (d-septet)**. This does not match.\n*   **Conclusion for D:** This molecule can produce a `dtq`, but it cannot produce a `dtt`. So, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n#### **Analysis of A: 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3-CH2-CH(c)-CH(b)-COOH`\n         `|      |`\n         `C2H5   C2H5`\nThe methine protons H(b) and H(c) are surrounded by other protons on chiral carbons and diastereotopic CH₂ groups. This leads to very complex splitting (e.g., doublet of doublets of doublets), not the clean `dtq` or `dtt` patterns described. So, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n#### **Analysis of B: 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3-CH(b)(C2H5)-CH(e)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`\nThe key protons are the two methines, H(b) on C4 and H(e) on C3.\n*   **Proton H(b) (on C4):** Let's count its neighbors.\n    *   The methine proton H(e) on C3 (1H).\n    *   The protons on the terminal CH₃ group (3H).\n    *   The protons on the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2H).\n    *   The neighbors are **(1H, 2H, 3H)**. This proton's signal will be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This is a perfect match for the first signal.\n\n*   **Proton H(e) (on C3):** Let's count its neighbors.\n    *   The methine proton H(b) on C4 (1H).\n    *   The protons on the main chain's CH₂ group at C2 (2H).\n    *   The protons on the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H).\n    *   The neighbors are **(1H, 2H, 2H)**. This proton's signal will be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This is a perfect match for the second signal.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nStructure B, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is the only candidate that has protons matching both of the specific splitting patterns (`dtq` and `dtt`) described in the 1H NMR data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\n**1. Deconstruct the Provided Information**\n\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules, consistent with this data.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** For a signal to have this splitting pattern, the corresponding proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   Doublet (d) implies coupling to one neighboring proton (a CH group).\n        *   Triplet (t) implies coupling to two neighboring protons (a CH₂ group).\n        *   Quartet (q) implies coupling to three neighboring protons (a CH₃ group).\n        *   Therefore, the proton responsible for the `dtq` signal must be adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group.\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** For a signal to have this splitting pattern, the corresponding proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   Doublet (d) implies coupling to one neighboring proton (a CH group).\n        *   Triplet (t) implies coupling to two neighboring protons (a CH₂ group).\n        *   Another Triplet (t) implies coupling to another, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (a second, different CH₂ group).\n        *   Therefore, the proton responsible for the `dtt` signal must be adjacent to a CH group and two non-equivalent CH₂ groups.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Structures**\n\nFirst, let's interpret the condensed formulas into structural drawings and systematic (IUPAC) names.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH** is **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    ```\n          CH₃ CH₃\n          |   |\n    CH₃ - CH--CH--CH₂--COOH\n     5    4   3    2    1\n    ```\n    Let's check for the required signals:\n    *   **H at C3**: Is coupled to H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) would indeed produce a **dtq**.\n    *   **dtt?**: Is there any proton coupled to one CH and two different CH₂ groups? No. Therefore, structure C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH** is **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    ```\n          CH₃ CH₃\n          |   |\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH--CH--COOH\n     5   4   3   2   1\n    ```\n    Let's check for the required signals:\n    *   **H at C3**: Is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This combination (1H, 2H, 3H) would produce a **dtq**.\n    *   **dtt?**: Is there any proton coupled to one CH and two different CH₂ groups? No. Therefore, structure D is incorrect.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH** is **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    ```\n          Et  Et\n          |   |\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH--CH--COOH\n     5   4   3   2   1\n    ```\n    Let's check for the required signals:\n    *   **H at C3**: Is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H). Since the molecule is chiral, these two CH₂ groups are non-equivalent. This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) would produce a **dtt**.\n    *   **dtq?**: Is there any proton coupled to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group? No. All methine (CH) and methylene (CH₂) protons lack a necessary neighbor type to form a `dtq`. For example, the protons on the CH₂ group at C4 are coupled to H at C3 (1H), the terminal CH₃ group (3H), and the geminal proton on C4. This gives a complex multiplet, but not a `dtq`. Therefore, structure A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH** can be interpreted as **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**. Let's draw it and analyze.\n    ```\n                 CH₃(on C4)\n                 |\n    CH₃-CH₂ -- CH -- CH -- CH₂ -- COOH\n     6   5      4      3      2      1\n                       |\n                       CH₂CH₃(on C3)\n    ```\n    Let's check this structure for the required signals:\n    *   **H at C4**: This proton is coupled to H at C3 (1H), the CH₂ at C5 (2H), and the CH₃ on C4 (3H). This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) will produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n    *   **H at C3**: This proton is coupled to H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H). Due to the chiral centers (C3 and C4), these two CH₂ groups are non-equivalent. This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStructure B is the only candidate that has protons in the correct electronic environments to produce both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for a carboxylic acid dimer.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum provides the most crucial information for determining the specific structure.\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This means there are no protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, so they are all consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This indicates a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving a doublet, `d`).\n    *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (giving a triplet, `t`).\n    *   Three equivalent neighboring protons (giving a quartet, `q`).\n    For this to occur, a `CH` group must be adjacent to a `CH` group, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group.\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This indicates a different single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving a doublet, `d`).\n    *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (giving one triplet, `t`).\n    *   A second group of two equivalent neighboring protons (giving another triplet, `t`).\n    For this to occur, a `CH` group must be adjacent to a `CH` group and two non-equivalent `CH₂` groups.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Proposed Structure\n\nLet's evaluate each candidate molecule to see if its structure can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. We will number the carbon chain starting from the `COOH` as C1.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n*   The proton on C3 (H-3) is adjacent to H-2 (1H), the C4-H₂ group (2H), and the C3-methyl group (3H). Its signal would be a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n*   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is adjacent to a `CH` group and two `CH₂` groups. Therefore, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`(CH₃)₂CH(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   The proton on C3 (H-3) is adjacent to H-4 (1H), the C2-H₂ group (2H), and the C3-methyl group (3H). Its signal would be a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n*   Like structure A, there is no proton that could produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH(4)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   Let's analyze the proton on C3 (H-3). It is adjacent to H-4 (1H), the C2-H₂ group (2H), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl substituent (2H). Its signal would be split into a doublet by H-4, a triplet by the C2-H₂ group, and another triplet by the ethyl `CH₂`. This results in a **dtt** signal. This matches Signal 2.\n*   Now let's analyze the proton on C4 (H-4). It is adjacent to H-3 (1H), the C5-H₃ methyl group (3H), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl substituent (2H). Its signal would be split into a doublet by H-3, a quartet by the C5-H₃ group, and a triplet by the ethyl `CH₂`. This results in a **dqt** (doublet of quartets of triplets) signal. A `dqt` is a highly complex multiplet with 24 lines, just like a `dtq`, and is the only possible source for this type of complex splitting in the given options that also has a `dtt`. It is very plausible that `dqt` is reported as `dtq`.\n*   Since this structure produces both a `dtt` and a `dqt` (reported as `dtq`), it matches all the NMR data.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₂CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n*   The proton on C3 (H-3) is adjacent to H-2 (1H), the C4-H₂ group (2H), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl substituent (2H). Its signal would be a **dtt**. This matches Signal 2.\n*   However, there is no proton in this structure that is adjacent to a `CH`, a `CH₂`, and a `CH₃` group. Therefore, it cannot produce the required `dtq` signal.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nOnly structure C, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, can give rise to both a `dtt` signal (from H-3) and a highly complex `dqt` signal (from H-4) which is reported as a `dtq`. Therefore, compound C is the unknown product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\n**1. Deconstruction of the problem**\nThe user has provided FTIR and ¹H NMR data for an unknown compound and a list of four possible structures. I need to use this spectroscopic information to identify the correct structure.\n\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   No signals corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four structures.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** According to the n+1 rule, this means the proton generating this signal is coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a doublet (d) splitting.\n        *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a triplet (t) splitting.\n        *   Three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), causing a quartet (q) splitting.\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means the proton generating this signal is coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a doublet (d) splitting.\n        *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a triplet (t) splitting.\n        *   Another, different set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a second triplet (t) splitting.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Candidate Structures**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to find the single structure that contains protons that would give rise to *both* a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal. I will analyze the most complex protons in each structure, which are the methine protons (`-CH-`) on the carbon chain.\n\n*   **Structure A: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n    This is 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid, or `(CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂COOH`. Let's analyze the proton on carbon-3, H(c) in `-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH₂(e)-`.\n    *   H(c) is coupled to: the H on carbon-4 (1H, doublet), the `CH₂` group at carbon-2 (2H, triplet), and the methyl group at carbon-3 (3H, quartet).\n    *   This gives a `dtq` signal. However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to one proton, a two-proton group, and another two-proton group. Thus, there is no `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **Structure B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n    This is 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid, `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`. Let's analyze the proton on carbon-3, H(c) in `...-CH(c)(C₂H₅)-CH(f)...`.\n    *   H(c) is coupled to: the H on carbon-2 (1H, doublet), the `CH₂` of the ethyl group at the end of the chain (2H, triplet), and the `CH₂` of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H, triplet).\n    *   This gives a `dtt` signal. However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbours. The methine proton on C2 would be a doublet of triplets. Methylene protons in the ethyl groups would be complex multiplets (likely ddq's), but not a clean `dtq`.\n\n*   **Structure D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n    This is 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid, `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. Let's analyze the proton on carbon-3, H(c) in `...-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(e)...`.\n    *   H(c) is coupled to: the H on carbon-2 (1H, doublet), the `CH₂` group of the terminal ethyl group (2H, triplet), and the methyl group substituent (3H, quartet).\n    *   This gives a `dtq` signal. However, similar to structure A, there is no environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **Structure C: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n    This corresponds to the structure **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`. Let's number the main chain starting from the carboxyl carbon as C1.\n    Structure:\n```\n           Et (ethyl on C3)\n           |\nHOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₅(from formula string)\n```\n    No, this naming is incorrect. Let's interpret the line formula `CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH` correctly.\n    It describes a pentanoic acid backbone with ethyl groups on carbons 3 and 4: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₃`.\n    Let's analyze the methine protons on carbons 3 and 4 of **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`\n\n    *   **Proton at C4 (H-4):**\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₃` group at C5 (3H, gives a **quartet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the methine proton at C3 (1H, gives a **doublet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2H, gives a **triplet**).\n        *   Combining these, the signal for H-4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n\n    *   **Proton at C3 (H-3):**\n        *   It is adjacent to the methine proton at C4 (1H, gives a **doublet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` group at C2 (2H, gives a **triplet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H, gives another **triplet**).\n        *   Combining these, the signal for H-3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\nStructure C is the only candidate that possesses the necessary structural features to produce both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the choices.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n    *   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This tells us there are no protons attached to sp² carbons of a C=C double bond. This is consistent with all four proposed structures, as none contain C=C double bonds.\n    *   **\"One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\"**: According to the n+1 rule, this means a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **Doublet (d)**: Coupled to 1 adjacent proton (a CH group).\n        *   **Triplet (t)**: Coupled to 2 adjacent protons (a CH₂ group).\n        *   **Quartet (q)**: Coupled to 3 adjacent protons (a CH₃ group).\n    *   **\"a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\"**: This means a different single proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **Doublet (d)**: Coupled to 1 adjacent proton (a CH group).\n        *   **Triplet (t)**: Coupled to 2 adjacent protons (a CH₂ group).\n        *   **Triplet (t)**: Coupled to another, non-equivalent set of 2 adjacent protons (another CH₂ group).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Proposed Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the key protons (the CH methine protons) in each structure. We will number the carbon chains starting from the COOH group as C1.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet), H's at C2 (2H, triplet), and its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet). This gives a **tdq** (or **dtq**). This matches one of the signals.\n    *   **H at C4**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet), its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet), and the terminal CH₃ at C5 (3H, quartet). This gives a **dqq**. This does not match the `dtt` signal. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(2)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **H at C2**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet). This gives a **dq**.\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet), and the CH₂ group at C4 (2H, triplet). This gives a **dqt**. Neither signal matches the required `dtq` and `dtt` pair. So, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n    The condensed formula `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` corresponds to 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid when the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group is identified.\n    Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    Let's analyze the key methine protons:\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet), H's at C2 (2H, triplet), and the H's on the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets). This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   **H at C4**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet), H's at C5 (2H, triplet), and the H's of its methyl group (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets). This matches the other required signal.\n    *   Since this structure produces both the `dtq` and the `dtt` signals, it is the correct answer.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(2)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), H's at C4 (2H, triplet), and the H's of its ethyl group's CH₂ (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt**. This matches one signal.\n    *   Are there any other protons that would give a `dtq`? The other methine proton is at C2. H at C2 is coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet), giving a `dt`. There are no protons coupled to a CH, a CH₂, *and* a CH₃ group. Therefore, this structure cannot produce a `dtq` signal. So, D is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion**\n    Only the structure corresponding to option C, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, gives rise to both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum, matching the experimental data perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1.

Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) described in the 1H NMR data.\n\n*   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This confirms there are no C=C double bonds in the molecule, which is consistent with all four structures.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This pattern arises when a single proton (or a set of equivalent protons) is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet (1+1=2).\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet (2+1=3).\n    *   A set of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet (3+1=4).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton with a {1H, 2H, 3H} set of neighbors. The order (dtq vs. tqd vs. qdt, etc.) depends on the relative sizes of the coupling constants (J-values), but the set of neighbors must be the same.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), giving a **d**oublet.\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), giving a **t**riplet.\n    *   Another, non-equivalent set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), giving another **t**riplet.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton with a {1H, 2H, 2H} set of neighbors.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the local environment of the methine (CH) protons in each structure to see if they match the required splitting patterns.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: Coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the -CH₂- of the ethyl group (2H), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H). This is a {1H, 2H, 3H} environment, which would produce a **dtq** (or tqd/qdt). This matches one signal.\n*   H at C2: Coupled to the H at C3 (1H), the -CH₃ on C2 (3H), and the -COOH proton (1H). This is a {1H, 3H, 1H} environment, which would produce a doublet of quartets of doublets (dqd). This does not match the `dtt` pattern.\n*   **Result:** Incorrect. Has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**B) (CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: Coupled to the H at C4 (1H), the -CH₂- group (2H), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H). This is a {1H, 2H, 3H} environment, producing a **dtq**. This matches one signal.\n*   H at C4: Coupled to the H at C3 (1H) and the two -CH₃ groups of the isopropyl tail (6H). This is a {1H, 6H} environment, producing a doublet of septets. This does not match the `dtt` pattern.\n*   **Result:** Incorrect. Has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: Coupled to H at C2 (1H), the -CH₂- of the C4-ethyl group (2H), and the -CH₂- of its own C3-ethyl group (2H). This is a {1H, 2H, 2H} environment, which would produce a **dtt**. This matches one signal.\n*   H at C2: Coupled to H at C3 (1H), the -CH₂- of its own C2-ethyl group (2H), and the -COOH proton (1H). This is a {1H, 2H, 1H} environment, which would produce a doublet of triplets of doublets (dtd). This does not match the `dtq` pattern.\n*   **Result:** Incorrect. Has a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.\n\n**C) CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH**\nLet's analyze the structure based on the provided formula, assuming a backbone of `CH3-CH-CH-CH2-COOH`. Let's label the methine protons H_a and H_b.\n`CH₃ - CH_a(C₂H₅) - CH_b(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - COOH`\n\n*   **Proton H_a**: Let's identify its neighbors.\n    *   On the adjacent methyl group: 3 protons.\n    *   The adjacent methine proton: H_b (1 proton).\n    *   The methylene (-CH₂-) of the ethyl group attached to its carbon: 2 protons.\n    *   The set of neighbors is **{3H, 1H, 2H}**. This will produce a **quartet of doublets of triplets (qdt)**, which is a permutation of `dtq`. **This is a match.**\n\n*   **Proton H_b**: Let's identify its neighbors.\n    *   The adjacent methine proton: H_a (1 proton).\n    *   The methylene (-CH₂-) next to the carboxylic acid: 2 protons.\n    *   The methylene (-CH₂-) of the ethyl group attached to its carbon: 2 protons.\n    *   The set of neighbors is **{1H, 2H, 2H}**. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. **This is a match.**\n\n*   **Result:** Correct. This structure is the only one that possesses one proton with a {1H, 2H, 3H} neighborhood (`dtq`) and a different proton with a {1H, 2H, 2H} neighborhood (`dtt`).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the 1H NMR splitting patterns, compound C is the only candidate that matches the experimental data.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. This broad peak typically overlaps with the C-H stretching absorptions.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible structures are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent with all options but does not distinguish between them.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **\"No vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules, consistent with this information.\n    *   **Key Information**: The spectrum contains two particularly complex and revealing signals: a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq) and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt). These multiplicities arise from a proton's signal being split by neighboring, non-equivalent protons. The N+1 rule applies for each group of equivalent neighboring protons.\n        *   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a single proton (1H, gives a doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (2H, gives a triplet), and a group of three equivalent protons (3H, gives a quartet).\n        *   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a single proton (1H, gives a doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (2H, gives a triplet), and another distinct group of two equivalent protons (2H, gives another triplet).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Potential Structure against the NMR Data:**\n    Let's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons in each molecule. We will focus on the most complex signals, which come from the CH (methine) protons on the carbon backbone. Note that in molecules with chiral centers, adjacent CH₂ protons are often diastereotopic (non-equivalent), which can complicate splitting patterns (e.g., turning an expected triplet into a doublet of doublets). However, the given names (`dtq`, `dtt`) suggest that we can, at a first-order approximation, treat these as equivalent protons for splitting purposes, or that there is \"accidental equivalence\" where the coupling constants are very similar.\n\n    Let's write out the structures assuming linear depiction and standard IUPAC naming conventions:\n\n    *   **A) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Me)-CH(3)(Me)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C3: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet) and the two protons at C2 (2H, triplet). Expected signal: `dt`.\n        *   Proton at C4: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the three protons at C5 (3H, quartet). Expected signal: `dq`.\n        *   This molecule does not produce a `dtt` or `dtq`.\n\n    *   **B) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-Diethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C3: Coupled to protons at C2 (2H, `t`), proton at C4 (1H, `d`), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, `t`). Expected signal: `tdt`.\n        *   Proton at C4: Coupled to proton at C3 (1H, `d`), protons at C5 (3H, `q`), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, `t`). Expected signal: `dqt` (doublet of quartets of triplets). This is close to `dtq`, just different order.\n        *   This molecule does not produce a `dtt`. It has a `tdt` and a `dqt`.\n\n    *   **C) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` -> 2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(2)(Me)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C2: Coupled only to H at C3 (1H, doublet). Expected signal: `d`.\n        *   Proton at C3: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet) and the two protons at C4 (2H, triplet). Expected signal: `dt`.\n        *   This molecule does not produce a `dtt` or `dtq`.\n\n    *   **D) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` -> 2,3-Diethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)(Et)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Let's analyze the proton at **C3**. It is adjacent to three different carbons bearing protons:\n            1.  C2, which has one proton (H at C2). This will split the C3-proton signal into a **doublet**.\n            2.  C4, which has two protons (the CH₂ group). These will split the C3-proton signal into a **triplet**.\n            3.  The first carbon of the ethyl group attached to C3, which is also a CH₂ group with two protons. These will also split the C3-proton signal into a **triplet**.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for the proton at C3 is expected to be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This is a perfect match for one of the signals described in the problem.\n        *   Now let's look for the **`dtq`** signal. While there isn't a proton with the exact neighboring environment (adjacent to 1H, 2H, and 3H groups) to produce a simple `dtq`, let's examine the protons in one of the diastereotopic CH₂ groups. For instance, the CH₂ protons at C4. They are adjacent to the CH proton at C3 and the CH₃ protons at C5. Due to being next to a chiral center (C3) and having geminal coupling to each other, their signal would be a **doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq)**. A `ddq` is a complex multiplet that can, under certain conditions or lower resolution, be mistaken for or reported as a `dtq`. Given the definitive and rare `dtt` signal is perfectly explained by this structure, it is the most plausible candidate. No other option can account for the `dtt` signal.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The structure of 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid (D) is the only one that can produce a `dtt` signal for the proton on C3. This provides extremely strong evidence for its identity. The other signal, `dtq`, is likely a slightly simplified description of one of the `ddq` signals present in the molecule.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nFirst, let's interpret the information from the characterization techniques.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group class but doesn't distinguish between the choices.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H). All four options are saturated molecules (containing only single bonds between carbons), so this is consistent with all of them.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises from a proton that is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons. According to the n+1 rule:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to 1 neighboring proton (n=1, multiplicity=1+1=2).\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to 2 neighboring protons (n=2, multiplicity=2+1=3).\n        *   **Quartet (q):** Coupling to 3 neighboring protons (n=3, multiplicity=3+1=4).\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises from a proton coupled to:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to 1 neighboring proton (n=1).\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to 2 neighboring protons (n=2).\n        *   **Another Triplet (t):** Coupling to a different group of 2 neighboring protons (n=2).\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in finding the single molecule that would produce *both* of these unique splitting patterns.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each of the proposed structures. The way the condensed formulas are written implies a sequential backbone.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`COOH - C(a)H(CH₃) - C(b)H(CH₃) - CH₂ - CH₃`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to H(a) (1H), the adjacent CH₂ (2H), and its own CH₃ (3H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Other protons:** None of the other protons (H(a), CH₂, CH₃) are coupled to one proton, a group of two, and another group of two protons. Therefore, this molecule does not have a dtt signal.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`COOH - CH₂ - C(a)H(CH₃) - C(b)H(CH₃) - CH₃`\n*   **Proton H(a):** It is coupled to H(b) (1H), the adjacent CH₂ (2H), and its own CH₃ (3H). This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one signal.\n*   **Other protons:** Proton H(b) is coupled to H(a) (1H) and two different CH₃ groups (3H and 3H). This would give a doublet of quartets of quartets (or a doublet of septets if the methyls were equivalent). No proton in this molecule would produce a dtt signal.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`COOH - C(a)H(C₂H₅) - C(b)H(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - CH₃`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to H(a) (1H), the adjacent CH₂ of the main chain (2H), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Other protons:** We now need to find a dtq signal (a proton coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors). Let's check the methylene protons. The -CH₂- protons in the main chain are coupled to H(b) (1H) and the terminal -CH₃ (3H). They would give a doublet of quartets (dq). The -CH₂- protons within the ethyl groups are also coupled to one methine proton (H(a) or H(b)) and one methyl group, which would also result in a dq. Therefore, this molecule does not have a dtq signal.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nLet's analyze the structure as written: a backbone of `C-C-C-C-COOH` with specified substituents.\n`CH₃(a) - C(b)H(C₂H₅) - C(e)H(C₂H₅) - C(h)H₂ - COOH`\n\n*   **Proton H(b):** This proton has three different neighboring groups of protons:\n    1.  The CH₃(a) group (3 protons) → creates a **quartet**.\n    2.  The methine proton H(e) (1 proton) → creates a **doublet**.\n    3.  The CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2 protons) → creates a **triplet**.\n    The resulting signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first signal.\n\n*   **Proton H(e):** This proton also has three different neighboring groups of protons:\n    1.  The methine proton H(b) (1 proton) → creates a **doublet**.\n    2.  The CH₂(h) group (2 protons) → creates a **triplet**.\n    3.  The CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2 protons) → creates another **triplet**.\n    The resulting signal for H(e) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second signal.\n\n### **3.

It has one proton environment that results in a dtq signal and a different proton environment that results in a dtt signal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\n**1.

Therefore, it is the only structure that matches all the provided spectral data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n1.  **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the range of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration within a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The broadness is due to the strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. This peak often overlaps with the C-H stretching absorptions.\n2.  **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong, sharp peak in the range of 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. All four possible structures (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent with all options but doesn't differentiate between them.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n1.  **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to sp²-hybridized carbons of a C=C double bond. All four candidate molecules are saturated alkanoic acids, meaning they contain only single bonds (other than the C=O group), so this observation is also consistent with all options.\n2.  **Signal Multiplicity:** This is the key piece of information for differentiating the structures. The multiplicity (splitting pattern) of a proton's signal is determined by the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons (n) according to the n+1 rule. When a proton is coupled to multiple *different* groups of protons, its signal is split successively by each group, leading to complex patterns like a \"doublet of triplets.\"\n\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This indicates that the proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (1+1 = **2**, a doublet).\n        *   Two neighboring protons (2+1 = **3**, a triplet).\n        *   Three neighboring protons (3+1 = **4**, a quartet).\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates the proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (1+1 = **2**, a doublet).\n        *   Two neighboring protons (2+1 = **3**, a triplet).\n        *   Another, different group of two neighboring protons (2+1 = **3**, a triplet).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Structure of Each Option**\n\nWe need to find the structure that contains one proton matching the `dtq` environment and another proton matching the `dtt` environment. We will focus on the protons on the chiral centers (methine, -CH- groups) as they are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\nLet's parse the condensed formulas. We'll label the protons on the main chain's methine groups as **H**_x_ and **H**_y_.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH**\n*   Structure: `CH₃CH₂-CHx(C₂H₅)-CHy(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n*   **H**_y_: Coupled to **H**_x_ (1H, gives doublet), the two protons of its attached ethyl group's -CH₂- (2H, gives triplet), and the COOH proton (1H, which typically doesn't couple or exchanges, so we ignore it for splitting). So, **H**_y_ is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   **H**_x_: Coupled to **H**_y_ (1H, gives doublet), the two protons of the adjacent -CH₂- from the main chain (2H, gives triplet), and the two protons of its attached ethyl group's -CH₂- (2H, gives triplet). So, **H**_x_ is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   *Conclusion:* Structure A shows a `dtt` signal but not a `dtq` signal. This is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n*   Structure: `CH₃-CHx(C₂H₅)-CHy(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   **H**_x_: Coupled to the adjacent **H**_y_ (1H, gives doublet), the three protons of the adjacent CH₃ group (3H, gives quartet), and the two protons of its attached ethyl group's -CH₂- (2H, gives triplet). Thus, the signal for **H**_x_ is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n*   **H**_y_: Coupled to the adjacent **H**_x_ (1H, gives doublet), the two protons of the adjacent -CH₂-COOH group (2H, gives triplet), and the two protons of its attached ethyl group's -CH₂- (2H, gives triplet). Thus, the signal for **H**_y_ is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n*   *Conclusion:* Structure B contains protons that would give rise to both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. This is a perfect match.\n\n**C) CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n*   Structure: `CH₃-CHx(CH₃)-CHy(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   **H**_x_: Coupled to **H**_y_ (1H, gives doublet), the three protons of the main chain's terminal CH₃ group (3H, gives quartet), and the three protons of its attached CH₃ group (3H, gives quartet). This would be a **doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq)**.\n*   **H**_y_: Coupled to **H**_x_ (1H, gives doublet), the two protons of the adjacent -CH₂-COOH group (2H, gives triplet), and the three protons of its attached CH₃ group (3H, gives quartet). The signal for **H**_y_ is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   *Conclusion:* Structure C has a `dtq` signal but not a `dtt` signal. This is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH**\n*   Structure: `CH₃CH₂-CHx(CH₃)-CHy(CH₃)-COOH`\n*   **H**_x_: Coupled to **H**_y_ (1H, gives doublet), the two protons of the main chain's -CH₂- group (2H, gives triplet), and the three protons of its attached CH₃ group (3H, gives quartet). The signal for **H**_x_ is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   **H**_y_: Coupled to **H**_x_ (1H, gives doublet) and the three protons of its attached CH₃ group (3H, gives quartet). The signal for **H**_y_ is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n*   *Conclusion:* Structure D has a `dtq` signal but not a `dtt` signal. This is incorrect.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure **B** has the correct combination of neighboring protons to produce both a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** and a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded environment. The broadness is a hallmark of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns (multiplicities) described. We need a single molecule that exhibits *both* of the following signals:\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** A proton responsible for this signal must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1) to cause the doublet splitting (n+1 = 2).\n    *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2) to cause the triplet splitting (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3) to cause the quartet splitting (n+1 = 4).\n    *   In summary, this proton must be adjacent to a methine (-CH), a methylene (-CH₂), and a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** A proton responsible for this signal must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1) to cause the doublet splitting (n+1 = 2).\n    *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2) to cause the first triplet splitting (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Another set of two equivalent, but non-identical, neighboring protons (n=2) to cause the second triplet splitting (n+1 = 3).\n    *   In summary, this proton must be adjacent to a methine (-CH) and two different methylene (-CH₂) groups.\n\n### 3. Evaluating Each Candidate Structure\n\nLet's find the IUPAC names and analyze the expected splitting for the protons on the main chain of each molecule.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n      CH₃(g) CH₃(f)\n       |      |\nCH₃(e)-CH₂(d)-CH(c)--CH(b)--COOH(a)\n```\n*   **Proton H(c):** This proton is adjacent to:\n    *   Proton H(b) (a 1H group) → creates a doublet (d).\n    *   The CH₂(d) group (a 2H group) → creates a triplet (t).\n    *   The CH₃(f) group (a 3H group) → creates a quartet (q).\n*   Thus, proton H(c) gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first signal.\n*   However, let's look for a proton that could give a `dtt`. For a `dtt`, a proton needs to be adjacent to one -CH and two different -CH₂ groups. This molecule only contains one -CH₂ group in total (the `d` protons). Therefore, **molecule A cannot produce a `dtt` signal**.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n      CH₃   CH₃\n       |     |\nCH₃ -- CH -- CH -- CH₂ -- COOH\n  (5)  (4)   (3)   (2)    (1)\n```\n*   **Proton H(3):** Is adjacent to CH₂(2) (a 2H group, giving a triplet), H(4) (a 1H group, giving a doublet), and its own CH₃ group (a 3H group, giving a quartet). This results in a **triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq)**. This does not match the required `dtq` or `dtt`.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n          Et(c)\n           |\nCH₃-CH₂ --CH(b)--CH(a)--COOH\n      (e)   |      |\n            Et(d)  Et(g)\n```\n(where Et = -CH₂CH₃)\n*   **Proton H(b):** This proton is on C3 of the pentanoic acid chain and is adjacent to:\n    *   Proton H(a) at C2 (a 1H group) → creates a doublet (d).\n    *   The CH₂ group of the main chain at C4 (let's call it CH₂(e)) → creates a triplet (t).\n    *   The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on its own carbon (let's call it CH₂(d)) → creates another triplet (t).\n*   Thus, proton H(b) gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second signal.\n*   Now, let's look for a proton that could give a `dtq`. For a `dtq`, a proton must be adjacent to a -CH, a -CH₂, and a -CH₃. There are no protons in this molecule with that specific set of three different types of neighbours. For example, the protons on the methylene groups of the ethyl side chains (e.g., in `d` or `g`) are next to a methine (-CH) and a methyl (-CH₃). Because the molecule is chiral, these methylene protons are diastereotopic and will also split each other (geminal coupling). This leads to `ddq` (doublet of doublets of quartets) signals, not `dtq` signals. Therefore, **molecule C cannot produce a `dtq` signal under normal circumstances.**\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n*   This structure's key protons give signals like **triplet of doublets of triplets (tdt)** and **quartet of doublets of triplets (qdt)**. Neither of these match the required signals.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nThere is a contradiction in the problem statement. No single molecule from the list can unambiguously produce *both* a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal based on standard splitting rules.\n*   Molecule **A** perfectly explains the **`dtq`** signal.\n*   Molecule **C** perfectly explains the **`dtt`** signal.\n\nHowever, in a multiple-choice context, we must select the best possible fit. Let's reconsider molecule **C**. It unequivocally produces the `dtt` signal. It also produces other complex signals, such as multiple `ddq`s (doublet of doublets of quartets) from the diastereotopic methylene protons. It is conceivable, though a stretch, that one of these `ddq` signals could be mistaken for or reported as a `dtq`, perhaps due to poor resolution or accidental equivalence of coupling constants. Molecule A, on the other hand, has no structural feature that could possibly lead to a `dtt` signal. Therefore, Molecule C is the more plausible candidate as it explains one complex signal perfectly and possesses other complex signals that are structurally related to the second required signal.\n\nThe presence of the very specific **`dtt`** signal is strong evidence pointing towards the structure of **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Provided Data**\n    *   **FTIR:**\n        *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n        *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but doesn't differentiate between the options.\n\n    *   **1H NMR:**\n        *   \"no signals correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\": This tells me there are no `C=C` double bonds in the molecule. All four options are saturated, so this information is consistent with all of them.\n        *   \"One of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\": This is a very specific splitting pattern. For a signal (let's say for a proton `HA`) to be a `dtq`, it must be coupled to three distinct neighboring groups of protons:\n            *   One single proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n            *   A group of two equivalent protons, like a CH₂ group (n=2, gives a triplet).\n            *   A group of three equivalent protons, like a CH₃ group (n=3, gives a quartet).\n        *   \"a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\": This is another highly specific pattern. A proton exhibiting this splitting must be coupled to three different groups of neighbors:\n            *   One single proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n            *   A group of two equivalent protons, like a CH₂ group (n=2, gives a triplet).\n            *   *Another* group of two equivalent protons, like a second, different CH₂ group (n=2, gives another triplet).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Structures of the Options**\n\n    The core of the problem is to find which of the four molecules would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum. I'll analyze the expected splitting patterns for the key protons (the ones on the carbon backbone, not the simple terminal ones) for each molecule.\n\n    *   **Option C: `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH`**\n        This formula represents 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid: `(CH₃)₂CH–CH(CH₃)–CH₂–COOH`.\n        *   Let's look at the `CH` proton at position 4: `–CH(CH₃)₂`. It is coupled to the `CH` proton at C3 (1H) and two methyl groups (6H). This signal would be a doublet of septets. Not a `dtq` or `dtt`.\n        *   Let's look at the `CH` proton at position 3: `–CH(CH₃)–`. It's coupled to the `CH₂` (2H), the `CH` at C4 (1H), and its own methyl group (3H). This is too complex and involves coupling to diastereotopic CH₂ protons, but it's not a clean `dtt` or `dtq`.\n        *   **Conclusion for C:** Unlikely to produce the specified signals.\n\n    *   **Option D: `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH`**\n        This represents 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid: `CH₃CH₂–CH(CH₃)–CH(CH₃)–COOH`.\n        *   Let's analyze the proton on C3 (`–CH(CH₃)–`). Its neighbors are the proton on C2 (1H), its own methyl group (3H), and the `CH₂` of the ethyl group (2H). This proton is coupled to a 1H neighbor, a 2H neighbor group, and a 3H neighbor group. This would produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**! So this molecule has one of the required signals.\n        *   Now, we need to find a `dtt` signal in this molecule. A `dtt` requires a proton coupled to one 1H neighbor and two different 2H neighbors. This molecule only has one `CH₂` group. It's impossible for any proton in this molecule to be coupled to two different `CH₂` groups.\n        *   **Conclusion for D:** It has the `dtq` but lacks the `dtt`. Not the answer.\n\n    *   **Option B: `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH`**\n        This represents 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid: `CH₃CH₂–CH(C₂H₅)–CH(C₂H₅)–COOH`.\n        *   Let's analyze the proton on C3 (`–CH(C₂H₅)–`). Its neighbors are the proton on C2 (1H), the `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2H), and the `CH₂` group at the end of the pentanoic acid chain (2H). This proton is coupled to a 1H neighbor and two different 2H neighbors. This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**! This molecule has the other required signal.\n        *   Now, let's look for a `dtq`. This requires a proton coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors. Looking at the protons on C2 and C3, and even the protons within the `CH₂` groups, none have this specific set of neighbors. For example, the proton on C2 is coupled to the proton on C3 (1H) and the `CH₂` of its ethyl group (2H), giving a `dt`. The protons in the various `CH₂` groups would give `ddq` patterns (doublet of doublets of quartets).\n        *   **Conclusion for B:** It has the `dtt` but lacks the `dtq`. Not the answer.\n\n    *   **Option A: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\n        This notation is best interpreted as a chain built from these pieces, resulting in 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid: `CH₃–CH(C₂H₅)–CH(C₂H₅)–CH₂–COOH`.\n        Let's draw out the key protons on the backbone: `CH₃–CH(d)–CH(c)–CH₂(b)–COOH`. Each `CH` has an ethyl group attached.\n        *   Let's analyze the proton `H(c)`. Its neighbors are: the `CH₂(b)` group (2H), the `CH(d)` proton (1H), and the `CH₂` group from its own ethyl substituent (2H). Therefore, `H(c)` is coupled to one 1H neighbor and two different 2H neighbors. Its signal is a **dtt**.\n        *   Let's analyze the proton `H(d)`. Its neighbors are: the `CH(c)` proton (1H), the terminal `CH₃` group (3H), and the `CH₂` group from its own ethyl substituent (2H). Therefore, `H(d)` is coupled to a 1H neighbor, a 2H neighbor, and a 3H neighbor. Its signal is a **dtq**.\n        *   **Conclusion for A:** This molecule contains a proton that gives a `dtt` signal (`H(c)`) and a different proton that gives a `dtq` signal (`H(d)`). This matches the provided data perfectly.\n\n3.  **Final Decision**\n\n    Based on the detailed ¹H NMR splitting analysis, only the structure corresponding to option A, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, exhibits both a doublet of triplets of triplets and a doublet of triplets of quartets.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This peak is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is forming a hydrogen-bonded dimer. The broadness is a key feature. This signal often overlaps with C-H stretching absorptions.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The FTIR data strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). Since all four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, the FTIR data confirms the class of compound but does not help distinguish between the specific isomers. The deciding information must come from the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### 2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four candidate molecules are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all options.\n*   **Key splitting patterns:** The spectrum shows two particularly complex signals:\n    1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nThese complex splitting patterns (multiplets) arise when a proton is magnetically coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons. The multiplicity of the signal for a proton (let's call it H_A) coupled to a group of 'n' equivalent protons (H_B) is given by the **n+1 rule**.\n*   Doublet (d): Coupled to 1 proton (n=1).\n*   Triplet (t): Coupled to 2 protons (n=2).\n*   Quartet (q): Coupled to 3 protons (n=3).\n\nA **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** means one proton is coupled to:\n*   One neighboring proton (giving the doublet).\n*   A set of two neighboring protons (giving the triplet).\n*   A set of three neighboring protons (giving the quartet).\n\nA **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** means one proton is coupled to:\n*   One neighboring proton (giving the doublet).\n*   A set of two neighboring protons (giving one triplet).\n*   Another, different set of two neighboring protons (giving the second triplet).\n\n### 3. Structural Analysis of Each Option\n\nLet's determine the IUPAC name for each condensed formula and analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons on the main chain. We'll focus on 3-bond (vicinal) couplings.\n\n**A) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\n*   **Structure:** Interpreting the formula string from left to right as a continuous chain with branches gives `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`.\n*   **IUPAC Name:** To name this, we find the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group. That chain is 5 carbons long (the pentanoic acid chain is `HOOC-CH2-CH-CH-CH3`). There are ethyl substituents at positions 3 and 4. The name is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **Splitting Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   **H at C4:** This proton is coupled to three groups of vicinal protons:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → doublet (d)\n        2.  The protons of the terminal methyl group at C5 (3H) → quartet (q)\n        3.  The protons of the methylene (CH2) group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        This proton's signal will be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **H at C3:** This proton is also coupled to three groups of vicinal protons:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → doublet (d)\n        2.  The protons of the methylene group at C2 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        3.  The protons of the methylene (CH2) group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        This proton's signal will be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure A is an excellent candidate as it is predicted to have both of the complex signals observed in the spectrum.\n\n**B) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH`**\n*   **Structure:** `(CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n*   **IUPAC Name:** 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Splitting Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C4 (1H), CH2 at C2 (2H), and CH3 on C3 (3H). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   **H at C4:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H) and the two methyl groups (6H). This gives a **doublet of septets (d-sept)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This structure has a `dtq`, but it lacks the `dtt` signal. It is incorrect.\n\n**C) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH`**\n*   **Structure:** `CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n*   **IUPAC Name:** 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Splitting Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H) and its methyl group protons (3H). This gives a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n    *   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H) and CH2 at C4 (2H). This gives a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This structure does not have a `dtq` or a `dtt`. It is incorrect.\n\n**D) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH`**\n*   **Structure:** `CH3-CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH`\n*   **IUPAC Name:** 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Splitting Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H), CH2 at C4 (2H), and its ethyl CH2 (2H). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H) and its ethyl CH2 (2H). This gives a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This structure has a `dtt` but lacks the required `dtq` signal. It is incorrect.\n\n### Final Identification\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR splitting patterns, only the structure corresponding to option A, **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, will produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).

We are given two key pieces of information about the splitting patterns (multiplicities) of two different proton signals:\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n*   Additionally, we know there are no vinyl hydrogens (protons on a C=C double bond), which is consistent with all four saturated structures.\n\nThe multiplicity of a signal for a proton (or a group of equivalent protons) is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons.\n*   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to 1 neighboring proton.\n*   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to 2 neighboring protons.\n*   **Quartet (q):** Indicates coupling to 3 neighboring protons.\n\nFor a complex signal like a `dtq`, a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n*   **dtq:** A proton coupled to one proton (d), two protons (t), and three protons (q). A likely local environment would be a CH proton that is adjacent to another CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n*   **dtt:** A proton coupled to one proton (d), two protons (t), and another group of two protons (t). A likely local environment would be a CH proton that is adjacent to another CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\nNow, let's analyze each candidate structure to see if it can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n**Parsing the Condensed Formulas:**\n\nLet's assume the formulas represent a linear chain of the specified segments.\n\n*   **Structure C: `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`**\n    This formula can be interpreted as a chain of segments: `CH₃-`, `-CH(C₂H₅)-`, `-CH(C₂H₅)-`, and `-CH₂-COOH`. Connecting these gives:\n    `CH₃ - CH(C₂H₅) - CH(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - COOH`\n\n    To determine the IUPAC name and analyze the structure, we must find the longest carbon chain containing the carboxyl group (C1).\n    `HOOC(1) — CH₂(2) — CH(3)(C₂H₅) — CH(4)(C₂H₅) — CH₃(start)`\n    If we follow the backbone as written, the chain is 5 carbons long (pentanoic acid). However, the ethyl group on C4 (`-CH₂CH₃`) extends the chain.\n    The longest chain is: `HOOC(1) — CH₂(2) — CH(3)(C₂H₅) — CH(4)(CH₃) — CH₂(5) — CH₃(6)`\n    This structure is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n\n    Let's analyze the protons on the main chain's chiral centers (C3 and C4):\n    1.  **Proton at C3 (H3):** This proton is adjacent to:\n        *   The `CH₂` group at C2 (2 protons) → gives a **triplet**.\n        *   The `CH` group at C4 (1 proton) → gives a **doublet**.\n        *   The `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2 protons) → gives a **triplet**.\n        Therefore, the signal for H3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n    2.  **Proton at C4 (H4):** This proton is adjacent to:\n        *   The `CH` group at C3 (1 proton) → gives a **doublet**.\n        *   The `CH₂` group at C5 (2 protons) → gives a **triplet**.\n        *   The `CH₃` substituent group on C4 (3 protons) → gives a **quartet**.\n        Therefore, the signal for H4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other observed signal.\n\n    Structure C is the only candidate that gives rise to *both* a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal.\n\n*   **Analysis of Other Options (Briefly):**\n\n    *   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):** The proton at C3 is adjacent to a CH (C2), a CH₂ (part of the ethyl group), and a CH₃. This gives a `dtq`. However, there is no proton in this molecule adjacent to one CH and two CH₂ groups, so it cannot produce a `dtt`.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):** The proton at C3 is adjacent to a CH (C4), a CH₂ (C2), and a CH₃. This gives a `dtq`. Like structure A, it lacks the necessary arrangement to produce a `dtt`.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):** The proton at C3 is adjacent to a CH (C2), a CH₂ (from the starting ethyl group), and a CH₂ (from its own ethyl substituent). This gives a `dtt`. However, no proton in this molecule has neighbors of CH, CH₂, and CH₃, so it cannot produce a `dtq`. The other complex signals would likely be doublet of doublet of quartets (ddq).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed ¹H NMR analysis, only the structure corresponding to formula C can account for both a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" signal and a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" signal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n1.  **Very broad absorption at ~3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadening is a hallmark of this functional group.\n2.  **Strong absorption at ~1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position (1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is typical for the carbonyl group in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the class of compound but doesn't distinguish between the options yet.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Splitting Patterns**\n\nThe key to identifying the specific structure lies in the complex splitting patterns observed in the 1H NMR spectrum. The multiplicity of a proton signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (n) following the n+1 rule. For a proton coupled to multiple, different sets of neighboring protons (n₁, n₂, n₃...), the signal is split into a \"multiplet of multiplets,\" with a total of (n₁+1)(n₂+1)(n₃+1)... lines.\n\n1.  **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to one neighboring proton (1H).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to a set of two neighboring protons (a CH₂ group).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Indicates coupling to a set of three neighboring protons (a CH₃ group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton responsible for this signal must be a single proton (a CH group) that is adjacent to three different groups: another CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n\n2.  **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to one neighboring proton (1H).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to a set of two neighboring protons (a CH₂ group).\n    *   **Another triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to a second, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (another CH₂ group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton responsible for this signal must be a single proton (a CH group) that is adjacent to three different groups: another CH group, one CH₂ group, and a second, chemically different CH₂ group.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's interpret the condensed formulas as linear chains and analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons on the main chain.\n\n*   **A) 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid:** `CH₃-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-COOH`\n    *   Let's label the main chain carbons starting from the COOH group: `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)(Et)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** Is coupled to H-2 (1H, gives doublet), CH₂-4 (2H, gives triplet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives triplet). This proton's signal would be a **dtt**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **H-2:** Is coupled to H-3 (1H, gives doublet) and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives triplet). Its signal would be a `dt`.\n    *   This structure gives a `dtt` signal but **lacks a proton that would give a `dtq` signal**. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid:** `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   Let's label the main chain: `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** Is coupled to H-4 (1H, gives doublet), CH₂-2 (2H, gives triplet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives triplet). This proton's signal would be a **dtt**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **H-4:** Is coupled to H-3 (1H, gives doublet), CH₃-5 (3H, gives quartet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives triplet). This proton's signal would be a **dqt** (doublet of quartets of triplets), which has the same components as a `dtq`. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **This structure provides protons that account for BOTH the `dtt` and the `dtq` signals.** Therefore, B is a very strong candidate.\n\n*   **C) 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid:** `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   Let's label the main chain: `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** Is coupled to H-4 (1H, gives doublet), CH₂-2 (2H, gives triplet), and the C3-methyl group (3H, gives quartet). This proton's signal would be a **dqt**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **H-4:** Is coupled to H-3 (1H, gives doublet) and two methyl groups (CH₃-5 and the C4-methyl). These 6 protons would likely split H-4 into a septet. The overall signal would be a `d-sept` or a more complex multiplet if the methyls are non-equivalent (`dqq`), but not a `dtt`.\n    *   This structure gives a `dtq` signal but **lacks a proton that would give a `dtt` signal**. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid:** `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`\n    *   Let's label the main chain: `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** Is coupled to H-2 (1H, gives doublet), CH₂-4 (2H, gives triplet), and the C3-methyl group (3H, gives quartet). This proton's signal would be a **dqt**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **H-2:** Is coupled to H-3 (1H, gives doublet) and the C2-methyl group (3H, gives quartet). Its signal would be a `dq`.\n    *   This structure gives a `dtq` signal but **lacks a proton that would give a `dtt` signal**. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure of 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid (**Option B**) has protons in the correct chemical environments to produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (H-3) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (H-4).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The peak is very broad due to the range of hydrogen bond strengths. It also overlaps with C-H stretching absorptions.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic C=O (carbonyl) stretching frequency for a carboxylic acid dimer (due to hydrogen bonding).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not help distinguish between them.\n\n### 2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to solving the problem lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) of two specific signals.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nThe splitting of a proton signal is determined by the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons (vicinal coupling). The multiplicity follows the n+1 rule. A complex pattern like a `dtq` means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons.\n*   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to 1 adjacent proton (1+1=2 lines).\n*   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to 2 adjacent protons (2+1=3 lines).\n*   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to 3 adjacent protons (3+1=4 lines).\n\nSo, for a signal to be a **dtq**, the corresponding proton must have three neighboring groups of protons: one with 1 proton, one with 2 protons, and one with 3 protons.\n\nFor a signal to be a **dtt**, the corresponding proton must have three neighboring groups of protons: one with 1 proton, two with 2 protons.\n\nThe correct compound must have protons that exhibit **both** of these splitting patterns. Let's analyze the structure of each option. We will number the carbon chain starting with the carboxylic acid carbon as C1.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Each Option**\n\n#### **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n                 CH₃(on C3)\n                  |\n     CH₃-CH₂--CH--CH--COOH\n             |\n            CH₃(on C2)\n     C5 C4  C3   C2   C1\n```\n\n*   **Proton on C3 (H3):** Is coupled to:\n    *   Protons on C4 (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   Proton on C2 (1H) → Doublet (d)\n    *   Protons on the C3-methyl group (3H) → Quartet (q)\n    *   **Splitting Pattern: dtq (or tqd, etc.)**. This **MATCHES** one of the signals.\n\n*   **Is there a dtt?** A `dtt` requires a proton to be coupled to groups of (1H, 2H, 2H). This molecule has only one CH₂ group in its main chain (at C4) and no CH₂ groups in its substituents. It is impossible to find a proton coupled to two different sets of 2H neighbors.\n*   **Conclusion for D:** Has a `dtq`, but no `dtt`. Ruled out.\n\n#### **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n                 C₂H₅ (on C3)\n                  |\n     CH₃-CH₂--CH--CH--COOH\n             |\n            C₂H₅ (on C2)\n     C5 C4  C3   C2   C1\n```\n\n*   **Proton on C3 (H3):** Is coupled to:\n    *   Proton on C2 (1H) → Doublet (d)\n    *   Protons on C4 (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   Protons on the CH₂ of the C3-ethyl group (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   **Splitting Pattern: dtt**. This **MATCHES** the other signal.\n\n*   **Is there a dtq?** A `dtq` requires coupling to a 3H group (like a methyl group). Let's check potential candidates. H2 is a `dt`. H4 is a `dq`. The CH₂ protons on the ethyl groups would be complex but not a `dtq`.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Has a `dtt`, but no `dtq`. Ruled out.\n\n#### **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n            CH₃(on C3) CH₃(on C4)\n             |          |\n     CH₃--CH----CH----CH₂----COOH\n     C5   C4     C3    C2      C1\n```\n\n*   **Proton on C3 (H3):** Is coupled to:\n    *   Protons on C2 (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   Proton on C4 (1H) → Doublet (d)\n    *   Protons on the C3-methyl group (3H) → Quartet (q)\n    *   **Splitting Pattern: dtq**. This **MATCHES** one of the signals.\n\n*   **Is there a dtt?** As with compound D, this molecule lacks the required number of different CH₂ groups to create a `dtt` signal. The proton at C4 is a doublet of septets (coupled to H3 (1H) and the two methyl groups at C5 (6H total)).\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Has a `dtq`, but no `dtt`. Ruled out.\n\n#### **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n\nSince options B, C, and D have been eliminated, A must be the correct answer. Let's confirm by analyzing its structure. The most logical structure represented by this 9-carbon formula is 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid.\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n                 C₂H₅(on C3) C₂H₅(on C4)\n                  |           |\n     CH₃----CH-----CH------CH₂-----COOH\n     C5     C4     C3      C2       C1\n```\n*   **Proton on C3 (H3):** Is coupled to:\n    *   Proton on C4 (1H) → Doublet (d)\n    *   Protons on C2 (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   Protons on the CH₂ of the C3-ethyl group (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   **Splitting Pattern: dtt**. This **MATCHES** one required signal.\n\n*   **Proton on C4 (H4):** Is coupled to:\n    *   Proton on C3 (1H) → Doublet (d)\n    *   Protons on the CH₂ of the C4-ethyl group (2H) → Triplet (t)\n    *   Protons on the C5-methyl group (3H) → Quartet (q)\n    *   **Splitting Pattern: dtq**. This **MATCHES** the other required signal.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** The structure for compound A, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, exhibits signals with both the required `dtt` and `dtq` splitting patterns.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only compound whose structure can produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) is the one corresponding to formula A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   All four potential compounds are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group is present but does not help differentiate between the options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   The information that there are no vinyl-hydrogens confirms the absence of C=C double bonds. All four structures are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all options.\n    *   The crucial information lies in the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of two specific signals:\n        *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n        *   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structural Requirements for Each Splitting Pattern:**\n    *   For a **dtq**, a proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving a doublet, d).\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (e.g., a CH₂ group, giving a triplet, t).\n        *   A group of three equivalent neighboring protons (e.g., a CH₃ group, giving a quartet, q).\n        This implies a structural fragment like `CH₃-CH₂-CH*-CH-`, where `H*` is the proton being observed.\n    *   For a **dtt**, a proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving a doublet, d).\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (e.g., a CH₂ group, giving a triplet, t).\n        *   *Another* different group of two equivalent neighboring protons (e.g., a second CH₂ group, giving another triplet, t).\n        This implies a structural fragment like `-CH₂-CH*-CH₂-CH-`, where `H*` is the proton being observed.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Structure:**\n\n    *   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n        `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n        This molecule has only one CH₂ group. It is structurally impossible for any proton to be coupled to two different CH₂ groups, so it cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (Interpreted as 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n        `CH₃-CH₂(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is not correct. Correct interpretation: `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`, which leads to the IUPAC name 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid (as it is an isomer of C9H18O2). If interpreted as 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, (`CH3-CH2-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`, a C10 compound) it has two different protons (on C3 and C4) which could both give `dtt` signals, but no proton that would give a clear `dtq` signal from first-order analysis.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n        `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`\n        The proton on C3 is coupled to the C2 proton (1H, doublet), the C4 methylene protons (2H, triplet), and the C3-methyl protons (3H, quartet). This perfectly matches the requirement for a **dtq**. However, the molecule contains only one CH₂ group, so it is impossible for it to produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n        `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-COOH`\n        Let's analyze the proton on C3 (the third carbon from the COOH group):\n        `CH₃CH₂–CH(Et)–CH(Et)–COOH`\n                       ^\n                     (H on C3)\n        This C3 proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton on C2 (1H) → doublet (d).\n        *   The methylene (CH₂) protons on C4 (2H) → triplet (t).\n        *   The methylene (CH₂) protons of its own ethyl group substituent (2H) → triplet (t).\n        This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This molecule perfectly explains one of the required signals.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Molecule C can explain the `dtq` but not the `dtt`. Molecule D can explain the `dtt` but explaining the `dtq` is not straightforward from a simple first-order analysis (it would likely arise from the accidental simplification of a more complex multiplet like a `ddq` from a diastereotopic methylene group, which is common in complex molecules).\n    However, it is structurally *impossible* for molecule C to produce a `dtt` because it lacks the required number of neighboring CH₂ groups. In contrast, molecule D is a complex structure that contains all the necessary pieces (CH, CH₂, CH₃ groups) and perfectly explains the highly specific `dtt` pattern. Therefore, it is the only plausible structure among the choices that could exhibit both phenomena, even if one requires a more advanced NMR interpretation. Given the options, Molecule D is the best fit.\n\nThe compound is **CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at ~3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to become very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption at ~1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. For a saturated aliphatic carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears in the 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ range.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is present but does not help distinguish between the different isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four structures are fully saturated alkanoic acids, so they are all consistent with this observation.\n*   **Complex Signal Multiplicities:** This is the key piece of information for distinguishing the isomers. We are told the spectrum contains two distinct and complex signals:\n    1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n**3. Deducing the Local Environment from Signal Multiplicities**\n\nWe need to determine what kind of local proton environment would lead to these specific splitting patterns. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent, chemically non-equivalent protons (the 'n+1' rule). When a proton is coupled to multiple different sets of neighboring protons, we observe a multiplet of multiplets.\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** For a proton to show this pattern, it must be simultaneously coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   A group of **one** proton (1+1 = 2 lines, a **d**oublet). This is typically a methine group (`-CH-`).\n    *   A group of **two** equivalent protons (2+1 = 3 lines, a **t**riplet). This is typically a methylene group (`-CH2-`).\n    *   A group of **three** equivalent protons (3+1 = 4 lines, a **q**uartet). This is a methyl group (`-CH3`).\n    *   Therefore, the proton producing the `dtq` signal is a methine proton (`-CH-`) with a `CH`, a `CH2`, and a `CH3` group on adjacent carbons. Schematically: `R-CH-CH(this proton)-CH2-R'` and this proton's carbon is also bonded to a `CH3` group. Or a permutation like: `R-CH2-CH(this proton)(CH3)-CH-R'`.\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** For a proton to show this pattern, it must be coupled to:\n    *   A group of **one** proton (1+1 = 2 lines, a **d**oublet). This is a methine group (`-CH-`).\n    *   A group of **two** equivalent protons (2+1 = 3 lines, a **t**riplet). This is a methylene group (`-CH2-`).\n    *   *Another, different* group of **two** equivalent protons (2+1 = 3 lines, another **t**riplet). This is a second, non-equivalent methylene group (`-CH2-`).\n    *   Therefore, the proton producing the `dtt` signal is a methine proton (`-CH-`) that is adjacent to another `CH` group and two different `CH2` groups. Schematically: `R-CH2-CH(this proton)(CH2-R'')-CH-R'`.\n\n**4. Evaluating Each Candidate Structure**\n\nNow we must examine the structure of each option to see if it contains protons in the required environments to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. We will focus on the methine (`-CH-`) protons in the backbone of each molecule.\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2-CH(c)(CH3)-CH(e)(CH3)-COOH:**\n    *   Proton **H(c)**: Is adjacent to a `-CH2-` group, a `-CH(e)-` group, and a `-CH3` group. Its neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 3H. This proton will be a **dtq**.\n    *   Proton **H(e)**: Is adjacent to a `-CH(c)-` group and a `-CH3` group. Its neighbors are 1H and 3H. This proton will be a doublet of quartets (`dq`).\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Has a `dtq` signal but not a `dtt` signal. Incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH3-CH(b)(CH3)-CH(d)(CH3)-CH2-COOH:**\n    *   Proton **H(b)**: Is adjacent to a `-CH(d)-` group and two `-CH3` groups. Its neighbors are 1H, 3H, and 3H. This proton will be a doublet of quartets of quartets (`dqq`).\n    *   Proton **H(d)**: Is adjacent to a `-CH(b)-` group, a `-CH2-` group, and a `-CH3` group. Its neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 3H. This proton will be a **dtq**.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Has a `dtq` signal but not a `dtt` signal. Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH3CH2-CH(c)(C2H5)-CH(f)(C2H5)-COOH:**\n    *   Proton **H(c)**: Is adjacent to a `-CH2-` from the ethyl on the end, a `-CH(f)-` group, and a `-CH2-` from the ethyl substituent. Its neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 2H. This proton will be a **dtt**.\n    *   Proton **H(f)**: Is adjacent to a `-CH(c)-` group and a `-CH2-` from its ethyl substituent. Its neighbors are 1H and 2H. This proton will be a doublet of triplets (`dt`).\n    *   **Conclusion for C:** Has a `dtt` signal but not a `dtq` signal. Incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH3-CH(f)(C2H5)-CH(c)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH:**\n    *   Proton **H(f)**: This methine proton is on the carbon adjacent to a `CH3-` group, a `CH(c)` group, and a `C2H5` group (specifically its `-CH2-`). The neighboring protons are: the `-CH3` group (3H), the `H(c)` proton (1H), and the `-CH2-` of the ethyl group (2H). This proton will be coupled to groups of 1H, 2H, and 3H, giving a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n    *   Proton **H(c)**: This methine proton is on the carbon adjacent to the `CH(f)` group, the `-CH2-COOH` group, and a `C2H5` group (specifically its `-CH2-`). The neighboring protons are: the `H(f)` proton (1H), the `-CH2-` group next to the acid (2H), and the `-CH2-` of its ethyl substituent (2H). This proton will be coupled to groups of 1H, 2H, and 2H, giving a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n    *   **Conclusion for D:** This structure contains a proton that produces a `dtq` signal AND a different proton that produces a `dtt` signal. This matches the experimental data perfectly.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe only compound that has the necessary structural features to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` in its 1H NMR spectrum is structure D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadening is due to the varying strengths of these hydrogen bonds.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid (typically found between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group is present in all candidates but doesn't help differentiate them.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four options are saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids, which is consistent with this information.\n*   **Key Signals:** The most useful information comes from the complex splitting patterns described:\n    *   **Signal 1: doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Signal 2: doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\n**3. Understanding the Splitting Patterns**\n\nThe multiplicity of a proton signal is determined by the number of adjacent non-equivalent protons (n) following the n+1 rule. When a proton is coupled to multiple *different* sets of protons, the multiplicities multiply.\n\n*   A **doublet (d)** means the proton is coupled to **1** adjacent proton.\n*   A **triplet (t)** means the proton is coupled to **2** adjacent protons.\n*   A **quartet (q)** means the proton is coupled to **3** adjacent protons.\n\nTherefore:\n*   A **dtq** corresponds to a proton that is simultaneously coupled to three different neighboring groups: one with **1 proton**, one with **2 protons**, and one with **3 protons**.\n*   A **dtt** corresponds to a proton that is simultaneously coupled to three different neighboring groups: one with **1 proton**, one with **2 protons**, and another one with **2 protons**.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Proposed Structure**\n\nWe need to find the structure that contains one proton environment matching the `dtq` pattern and a different proton environment matching the `dtt` pattern.\n\nLet's start by correctly identifying the IUPAC name for each formula, as this helps in systematic analysis. The parent chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the carboxyl group carbon (C1).\n\n*   **A) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` -> `(CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`**\n    *   Name: **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    *   Analysis: The proton at C3 (`-CH(CH3)-`) is coupled to C2-H₂ (2H, triplet), C4-H (1H, doublet), and its own CH₃ (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq**. However, there is no proton in the molecule that is coupled to two different sets of 2 protons, so there is **no dtt**. Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` -> `CH3CH2-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-COOH`**\n    *   Name: **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    *   Analysis: The proton at C3 (`-CH(Et)-`) is coupled to C2-H (1H, doublet), C4-H₂ (2H, triplet), and its ethyl's CH₂ (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt**. However, there is no proton in the molecule coupled to a CH₃ group on an adjacent carbon to produce a quartet, which is a requirement for a `dtq`. Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` -> `CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`**\n    *   Name: **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    *   Analysis: The proton at C3 (`-CH(CH3)-`) is coupled to C2-H (1H, doublet), C4-H₂ (2H, triplet), and its own CH₃ (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq**. Similar to option A, there is no proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal. Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\n    *   First, we determine the correct structure and name. The formula represents `CH3-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`. According to IUPAC rules, we must find the longest carbon chain containing the `COOH` group. That chain is 6 carbons long (`COOH-CH2-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH3`, if you trace through one of the ethyl groups).\n    *   Name: **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n    *   Structure diagram for analysis:\n        `6    5      4       3       2      1`\n        `CH₃--CH₂ -- CH -- CH ----- CH₂ -- COOH`\n                     `|    |`\n                    `CH₃  CH₂CH₃` (Et)\n    *   **Analyze the proton at C4 (H₄):**\n        *   It is a single `CH` proton.\n        *   It is coupled to the two protons on C5 (`CH₂`): multiplicity = triplet (t).\n        *   It is coupled to the single proton on C3 (`CH`): multiplicity = doublet (d).\n        *   It is coupled to the three protons of the methyl group (`CH₃`) attached to it: multiplicity = quartet (q).\n        *   The combined splitting is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n    *   **Analyze the proton at C3 (H₃):**\n        *   It is a single `CH` proton.\n        *   It is coupled to the single proton on C4 (`CH`): multiplicity = doublet (d).\n        *   It is coupled to the two protons on C2 (`CH₂`): multiplicity = triplet (t).\n        *   It is coupled to the two protons of its ethyl group's `CH₂`: multiplicity = triplet (t).\n        *   The combined splitting is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\nStructure D, which is correctly named 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, is the only compound that contains a proton with a `dtq` splitting pattern and another proton with a `dtt` splitting pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also a hallmark of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in deciphering the complex splitting patterns reported in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons according to the n+1 rule. For complex molecules with multiple sets of neighboring protons, the splitting pattern becomes multiplicative (e.g., a doublet of triplets).\n\n*   **Given Signals:**\n    *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n*   **Interpretation of Splitting Patterns:**\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** A proton responsible for this signal must be adjacent to three different sets of protons:\n        *   One proton (1H) causing the doublet (d) splitting.\n        *   Two equivalent protons (2H) causing the triplet (t) splitting.\n        *   Three equivalent protons (3H) causing the quartet (q) splitting.\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** A proton responsible for this signal must be adjacent to three different sets of protons:\n        *   One proton (1H) causing the doublet (d) splitting.\n        *   Two equivalent protons (2H) causing the first triplet (t) splitting.\n        *   Another set of two equivalent protons (2H) causing the second triplet (t) splitting.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each option to see which one would produce these specific splitting patterns for its protons. The protons on chiral centers (`CH`) are the most likely candidates for such complex splitting.\n\n*   **Structure A: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `(CH₃)₂CH(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   H on C3: Neighbors are H on C4 (1H, gives doublet) and CH₂ on C2 (2H, gives triplet). The splitting is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**. This does not match.\n    *   H on C4: Neighbors are H on C3 (1H, gives doublet) and the six protons of the two methyl groups (6H, gives septet). The splitting is a **doublet of septets**. This does not match.\n\n*   **Structure C: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₃CH₂(4)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(2)(C₂H₅)-COOH(1)`\n    *   H on C3: Neighbors are H on C2 (1H, gives doublet), the CH₂ on C4 (2H, gives triplet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives triplet). The splitting is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the signals.\n    *   H on C2: Neighbors are H on C3 (1H, gives doublet) and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives triplet). The splitting is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**. This structure has a `dtt` but not a `dtq`. Therefore, it's not the correct answer.\n\n*   **Structure D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₃CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n    *   H on C2: Neighbors are H on C3 (1H, gives doublet) and the three protons of the C2-methyl group (3H, gives quartet). The splitting is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This does not match.\n    *   H on C3: Neighbors are H on C2 (1H, gives doublet) and the CH₂ on C4 (2H, gives triplet). The splitting is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**. This does not match.\n\n*   **Structure B: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid)**\n    The chemical formula is best interpreted as 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid. Let's verify this interpretation.\n    `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-...` means a `sec-butyl` group fragment: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-`.\n    The full structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`.\n    Let's number the carbon chain from the carboxylic acid (C1):\n    `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    Now, let's analyze the protons on the two chiral centers, C3 and C4.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton (`H-C3`) is coupled to:\n        *   The proton on C4 (1H) → gives a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   The two protons on C2 (2H) → gives a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The two protons of its own ethyl group's CH₂ (2H) → gives another **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The resulting splitting pattern for the proton at C3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton (`H-C4`) is coupled to:\n        *   The proton on C3 (1H) → gives a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   The two protons on C5 (2H) → gives a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The three protons of its own methyl group (3H) → gives a **quartet (q)**.\n        *   The resulting splitting pattern for the proton at C4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second observed signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option B, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, has two protons with the exact complex splitting patterns (dtq and dtt) described in the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the region of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is a result of extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong, sharp peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the class of compound but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in interpreting the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four given structures (they are all saturated carboxylic acids).\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This indicates that a proton (or a set of equivalent protons) is being split by three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups of protons:\n    *   A group with **one** proton (n=1), leading to a **d**oublet (n+1=2).\n    *   A group with **two** protons (n=2), leading to a **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n    *   A group with **three** protons (n=3), leading to a **q**uartet (n+1=4).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates another proton (or set of protons) is being split by three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups of protons:\n    *   A group with **one** proton (n=1), leading to a **d**oublet (n+1=2).\n    *   A group with **two** protons (n=2), leading to a **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n    *   Another, non-equivalent group with **two** protons (n=2), leading to another **t**riplet (n+1=3).\n\n### **3. Structural Analysis of the Options**\n\nLet's deduce the structure for each option and predict the splitting patterns for the protons on the main chain, as these are the most likely candidates for such complex splitting. We will assume the formulas are written sequentially along the main carbon backbone and use IUPAC naming to clarify the structures. The COOH group is C1.\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)(Et)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** Coupled to H-2 (1H, gives a doublet), CH₂ of the ethyl group at C-3 (2H, gives a triplet), and CH₂(4) (2H, gives a triplet). The resulting pattern is **dtt**.\n    *   We need to find a `dtq`. Let's look at other protons. The CH₂ protons at C-4 are diastereotopic and would likely give `ddq` signals. Protons within the ethyl groups would also show complex patterns, but a `dtq` is not apparent. So, this molecule has a `dtt` but is missing the `dtq`.\n\n*   **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** This proton is coupled to H-4 (1H, gives a **d**oublet), the CH₂ protons at C-2 (2H, gives a **t**riplet), and the CH₂ protons of the ethyl group at C-3 (2H, gives a **t**riplet). The predicted splitting pattern is **dtt**.\n    *   **H-4:** This proton is coupled to H-3 (1H, gives a **d**oublet), the CH₂ protons of the ethyl group at C-4 (2H, gives a **t**riplet), and the CH₃ protons at C-5 (3H, gives a **q**uartet). The predicted splitting pattern is **dtq**.\n    *   This structure gives rise to both a `dtt` (from H-3) and a `dtq` (from H-4). This is a perfect match for the data.\n\n*   **C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH → 4,5-dimethylhexanoic acid**\n    `(CH₃)₂CH(5)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-4:** Coupled to H-5 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂ protons at C-3 (2H, gives a triplet), and the methyl protons on C-4 (3H, gives a quartet). The pattern is **dtq**.\n    *   **H-5:** Coupled to H-4 (1H, gives a doublet) and the six protons of the two methyl groups (6H, gives a septet). The pattern is a doublet of septets.\n    *   This molecule has a `dtq` but is missing the `dtt`.\n\n*   **D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(2)(Me)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H-3:** Coupled to H-2 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂ protons at C-4 (2H, gives a triplet), and the methyl protons on C-3 (3H, gives a quartet). The pattern is **dtq**.\n    *   The molecule has a `dtq` but lacks a proton that would give a `dtt` pattern.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically analyzing the expected ¹H NMR splitting patterns for each of the four possible structures, only compound B provides signals that match the experimental data of having both a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to become very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not yet distinguish between the candidates.\n\n### 2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This tells us there are no protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four proposed structures are saturated alkanoic acids, so they are all consistent with this piece of information.\n*   **A signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern means the proton responsible for this signal is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   A set of two neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   A set of three neighboring protons (n=3), which splits the signal into a **quartet**.\n    For a proton to have a `dtq` splitting pattern, its neighbors must be a `CH`, a `CH2` group, and a `CH3` group.\n*   **A different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This proton is also coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   A set of two neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   Another, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into another **triplet**.\n    For a proton to have a `dtt` splitting pattern, its neighbors must be a `CH` group and two different `CH2` groups.\n\n### 3. Evaluating Each Candidate Structure\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons in each molecule, focusing on the methine (CH) protons, as they are most likely to show such complex splitting. The IUPAC names help in visualizing the structures.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: This proton is adjacent to the C2-H (1 proton), the C4-H₂ (2 protons), and the C3-methyl (3 protons). The neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 3H. This would indeed produce a **dtq**.\n*   No proton in this molecule is adjacent to one CH group and two distinct CH₂ groups. Therefore, a `dtt` signal is not expected.\n\n**B) CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: This proton is adjacent to the C2-H₂ (2 protons), the C4-H (1 proton), and the C3-methyl (3 protons). The neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 3H. This would also produce a **dtq**.\n*   No proton in this molecule is adjacent to one CH group and two distinct CH₂ groups. Therefore, a `dtt` signal is not expected.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nThis formula is best interpreted by drawing the structure:\n      CH₂CH₃  CH₂CH₃\n      |       |\nCH₃ - CH -- CH -- CH₂ -- COOH\n    (C5) (C4)   (C3)   (C2)   (C1)\nLet's analyze the two methine (CH) protons:\n*   **H at C4:** This proton is adjacent to the C5-H₃ group (3 protons), the C3-H (1 proton), and the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2 protons). Its neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 3H. This proton will show a **dtq** signal. **(Match)**\n*   **H at C3:** This proton is adjacent to the C2-H₂ group (2 protons), the C4-H (1 proton), and the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2 protons). Its neighbors are one CH group (1H) and two non-equivalent CH₂ groups (2H and 2H). This proton will show a **dtt** signal. **(Match)**\n\n**Conclusion for C:** This structure is the only one that predicts both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nStructure:\n      CH₂CH₃  CH₂CH₃\n      |       |\nCH₃CH₂- CH -- CH -- COOH\n     (C4)   (C3)   (C2)   (C1)\n*   **H at C3:** This proton is adjacent to the C2-H (1 proton), the C4-H₂ (2 protons), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2 protons). Its neighbors are one CH group and two CH₂ groups. This would produce a **dtt**.\n*   **H at C2:** This proton is adjacent to the C3-H (1 proton) and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C2 (2 protons). Its neighbors are 1H and 2H. This would produce a `dt` (doublet of triplets), not a `dtq`. No other proton fits the requirement for a `dtq`.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR splitting patterns, only structure C, **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, can account for the presence of both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\n**1. Deconstruct the Provided Information**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four given structures are saturated, which is consistent with this information.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This splitting pattern arises when a proton (or a set of equivalent protons) is coupled to three different sets of neighboring non-equivalent protons. The number of neighbors is given by (multiplicity - 1).\n        *   Doublet (d) -> coupled to 1 proton.\n        *   Triplet (t) -> coupled to 2 protons.\n        *   Quartet (q) -> coupled to 3 protons.\n        *   Therefore, the proton giving the `dtq` signal must have three distinct neighboring groups: a single proton (`CH`), a methylene group (`CH₂`), and a methyl group (`CH₃`).\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** Using the same logic:\n        *   Doublet (d) -> coupled to 1 proton.\n        *   Triplet (t) -> coupled to 2 protons.\n        *   Triplet (t) -> coupled to another group of 2 protons.\n        *   Therefore, the proton giving the `dtt` signal must have three distinct neighboring groups: a single proton (`CH`) and two different methylene groups (`CH₂`).\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Structures**\n\nThe goal is to find the single molecule that contains *both* a proton with the environment for a `dtq` signal and *another* proton with the environment for a `dtt` signal.\n\nLet's represent the condensed formulas with clearer structural drawings and analyze the protons on the main chain (methine protons, `CH`), as these are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nThis formula represents **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n\nStructure:\n```\n      (f)CH₃ - (e)CH - (d)CH - (c)CH₂ - (b,a)COOH\n                |      |\n             (g,h)C₂H₅ (i,j)C₂H₅\n```\n*   **Proton He (on C4):** Let's examine its neighbors.\n    *   It is coupled to the proton **Hd on C3** (1H).\n    *   It is coupled to the three protons of the **methyl group CH₃(f)** (3H).\n    *   It is coupled to the two protons of the **methylene group CH₂(g)** of its ethyl side-chain.\n    *   **Neighbors: 1H, 3H, 2H.** This environment will produce a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**, which matches one of the signals.\n\n*   **Proton Hd (on C3):** Let's examine its neighbors.\n    *   It is coupled to the proton **He on C4** (1H).\n    *   It is coupled to the two protons of the **methylene group CH₂(c)** in the main chain.\n    *   It is coupled to the two protons of the **methylene group CH₂(i)** of its ethyl side-chain.\n    *   **Neighbors: 1H, 2H, 2H.** This environment will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, which matches the other signal.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** This molecule possesses protons corresponding to both `dqt` and `dtt` signals. It is a very strong candidate.\n\n**B) CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH** (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)\n*   **Proton on C3:** Neighbors are H on C4 (1H), CH₃ on C3 (3H), and CH₂ on C2 (2H). This gives a `dqt`.\n*   This molecule does **not** contain any proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H), so it cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH** (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)\n*   **Proton on C3:** Neighbors are H on C2 (1H), CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H), and CH₂ of the terminal ethyl group (2H). This gives a `dtt`.\n*   This molecule does **not** contain any proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H), so it cannot produce a `dqt` signal.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH** (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)\n*   **Proton on C3:** Neighbors are H on C2 (1H), CH₃ on C3 (3H), and the CH₂ of the terminal ethyl group (2H). This gives a `dqt`.\n*   This molecule does **not** contain any proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H), so it cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**3. Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure **A** (`3,4-diethylpentanoic acid`) has the required combination of neighboring protons to produce both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
