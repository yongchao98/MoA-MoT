Analysis of Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide, providing two key rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Step 1: Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\nThis is the first critical decision and there is a clear consensus among all provided answers.\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to four non-hydrogen atoms).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon.\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group attacks carbon **C6**.\n\nThis regioselectivity determines the product's constitution. The attack adds a methyl group to C6 and creates a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. When renumbered according to IUPAC rules, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options A and C, which have a different substitution pattern (`2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`) that would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either B or D.\n\n**3. Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry**\nThis is the most complex part of the problem and the source of disagreement among the candidate answers.\n\n*   **Retention at Unreacted Centers:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Original C1 (**R**) → New C1 (**R**)\n    *   Original C4 (**R**) → New C4 (**R**)\n    *   Original C3 (**R**) → New C5 (**R**) (due to IUPAC renumbering)\n    *   Therefore, the product must have the partial configuration **(1R, ?, 4R, 5R)...**. Both remaining options, B and D, satisfy this condition.\n\n*   **Inversion at the Attacked Center (C6):** The reaction causes an inversion of configuration at C6. The starting configuration is **(6S)**. The critical question is what the R/S descriptor becomes after inversion. A simple flip of the letter (S → R) is a common mistake, as the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n\n    *   **Reactant C6 Priorities:** The groups are -O- (from epoxide), -C1-, -C5-, and -H. The priority order is: **O (1)** > C1 (2) > C5 (3) > H (4).\n    *   **Product C2 (from C6) Priorities:** The groups are -C1(OH)-, -C3(old C5)-, the new **-CH₃**, and -H. The priority order is: **C1 (1)** > C3 (2) > **CH₃ (3)** > H (4).\n\n    The Sₙ2 reaction replaces the highest priority group (-O-, rank 1) with a group of lower priority (-CH₃, rank 3). This significant change in priorities requires a full 3D analysis (e.g., using chair conformations) to determine the final descriptor. A rigorous analysis of the trans-diaxial ring opening shows that while the 3D geometry at C6 inverts (a Walden inversion), the change in substituent priorities results in the new stereocenter at C2 having an **(S)** configuration. The majority of the provided answers that performed a detailed analysis correctly reached this conclusion.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   C1: **R** (retained)\n    *   C2: **S** (inverted from S, due to priority changes)\n    *   C4: **R** (retained)\n    *   C5: **R** (retained)\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect constitution.\nB) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\nC) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect constitution.\nD) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - **This matches the derived product exactly.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is an epoxide on a substituted cyclohexane ring, with the epoxide formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate) is a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide, providing two key rules: attack at the less hindered carbon and inversion of configuration at the site of attack.\n\n### 2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)\nThe first step is to identify which of the two epoxide carbons (C1 or C6) is less sterically hindered.\n*   **Carbon C1** is bonded to a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and H).\n\nA tertiary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Constitution of the Product\nThe attack at C6 adds a methyl group to that position and breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   To name the product using IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers, the ring is numbered towards the newly methylated carbon (the original C6), which becomes the new C2.\n*   The methyl groups are located at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   The product's constitutional isomer is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This immediately eliminates options B and C, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol) that would result from an attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or D.\n\n### 4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\nThis is the most critical step and requires careful analysis.\n*   **Retention at Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Original C1 (**R**) → New C1 (**R**)\n    *   Original C4 (**R**) → New C4 (**R**)\n    *   Original C3 (**R**) → New C5 (**R**)\n*   **Inversion at the Attacked Center:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon, C6. The starting configuration is **(S)**.\n\n**The Critical Point: Does Geometric Inversion Mean S → R?**\nA common mistake is to assume that an Sₙ2 inversion automatically flips the R/S descriptor (e.g., S becomes R). This is only true if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents remain in the same order. Here, they change significantly.\n\n*   **Priorities at Reactant C6:** The substituents are -O- (epoxide), -C1-, -C5-, and -H. The priority order is **O (1)** > C1 (2) > C5 (3) > H (4).\n*   **Priorities at Product C2 (from C6):** The substituents are -C1(OH)-, -C3(old C5)-, the new **-CH₃**, and -H. The priority order is **C1(OH) (1)** > C3 (2) > **CH₃ (3)** > H (4).\n\nThe reaction replaces the highest priority group (epoxide oxygen, rank 1) with a lower priority group (methyl, rank 3). Because of this significant change in priorities, a detailed 3D analysis is required to determine the final descriptor.\n\nA rigorous analysis shows that the geometric inversion (like an umbrella flipping inside out) combined with the re-ordering of substituent priorities results in the new stereocenter at C2 having an **(S)** configuration. The geometric inversion and the priority change effectively cancel each other out in terms of the final R/S label.\n\n### 5. Final Conclusion\nCombining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses:\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   C1 is **R** (retained).\n    *   C2 is **S** (inverted geometry, but S descriptor due to priority changes).\n    *   C4 is **R** (retained).\n    *   C5 is **R** (retained).\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reaction and Reactants**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide, providing two key rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\nThe first step is to identify which carbon of the epoxide (C1 or C6) is less sterically hindered.\n*   **Carbon C1** is bonded to a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA tertiary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\nThe site of attack determines the basic structure (constitution) of the product.\n*   The attack at C6 adds a methyl group to that position. The C6-O bond breaks, and after a standard aqueous workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups. To name it according to IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), the ring is numbered towards the newly methylated carbon.\n    *   New C1 ← Original C1\n    *   New C2 ← Original C6\n    *   New C4 ← Original C4\n    *   New C5 ← Original C3\n*   The methyl groups are located at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This constitutional analysis immediately eliminates options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-). The correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\nThis is the most critical step and will differentiate between options B and C.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The configurations of the stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) are **retained**.\n    *   Original C1 (**R**) → New C1 (**R**)\n    *   Original C3 (**R**) → New C5 (**R**)\n    *   Original C4 (**R**) → New C4 (**R**)\n    *   So far, the product has the configuration (1R, ?, 4R, 5R). This is consistent with both options B and C.\n\n*   **Attacked Center (C6):** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the site of attack. The starting configuration at C6 is **(S)**. The key question is whether the geometric inversion of a (6S) center results in a (2R) or a (2S) center in the product.\n    *   A simple assumption that an (S) center always inverts to an (R) center is a common mistake. The R/S descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents, which change during the reaction.\n    *   **At reactant C6:** The substituents are O, C1, C5, H. The priorities are **O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4)**.\n    *   **At product C2 (from C6):** The substituents are C1(OH), C3(from C5), Me, H. The priorities are **C1(OH)(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4)**.\n    *   The Sₙ2 reaction replaces the highest priority group (-O-, rank 1) with a group of lower priority (-CH₃, rank 3). In such cases, a geometric inversion (Walden inversion) often results in the **retention of the R/S descriptor**. A detailed 3D analysis confirms that the geometric inversion of the (S) center at C6 results in a new stereocenter at C2 with an **(S)** configuration.\n\n**5.

Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Rules:** The problem explicitly states the rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\nThe first step is to identify which carbon of the epoxide (C1 or C6) is less sterically hindered.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\nThe attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. A new methyl group is added to C6, and the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after workup.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new C1. The ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n*   The attack at C6 results in a product where the methyl groups are on adjacent carbons (the original C1 and C6). The IUPAC name for this substitution pattern is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This constitutional structure eliminates options A and D, which are named as `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. This incorrect pattern would result from an attack at C1.\n*   Therefore, the correct answer must be either **B** or **C**.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\nThis is the deciding step between options B and C. We apply the rules of stereochemistry.\n*   **Retention at Unreacted Centers:** The configurations at the stereocenters not directly attacked are retained.\n    *   Original C1 was **(R)**. It becomes the new C1, so the product is **(1R)**.\n    *   Original C4 was **(R)**. It becomes the new C4, so the product is **(4R)**.\n    *   Original C3 was **(R)**. It becomes the new C5, so the product is **(5R)**.\n    *   So far, the product has the partial configuration: **(1R, ?, 4R, 5R)**. This is consistent with both options B and C.\n\n*   **Inversion at the Attacked Center (The Critical Point):**\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of **(S)**.\n    *   The Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion). However, the R/S descriptor does not automatically flip from S to R. The descriptor must be reassigned based on the new set of substituents and their Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities.\n    *   **Priority Analysis:**\n        *   At reactant C6, the leaving group (the epoxide oxygen) has the highest priority (#1).\n        *   At product C2 (the old C6), the incoming group (the new methyl group) has a lower priority (#3) than the adjacent ring carbons.\n    *   Because the highest priority group is replaced by a lower priority group, the geometric inversion and the change in CIP priorities effectively cancel each other out in terms of the final R/S descriptor. A detailed 3D analysis confirms that the geometric inversion of the (S) center at C6 results in a new stereocenter at C2 that is also designated as **(S)**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nCombining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses:\n*   **Name:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reaction: Regioselectivity**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The substrate is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, and the reagent is Me₂CuLi (a Gilman reagent), which provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Rule:** The problem states that the nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Analysis:** The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is a **quaternary** carbon because it is bonded to a methyl group, the epoxide oxygen, and two other ring carbons.\n    *   **C6** is a **tertiary** carbon because it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, the epoxide oxygen, and two other ring carbons.\n*   **Conclusion:** The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1). Therefore, the methyl nucleophile attacks **C6**.\n\n**2. Determine the Product's Constitution**\n\n*   The attack at C6 adds a new methyl group to that position. The C6-O bond breaks, and after workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups. To name it according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1. The ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. This results in a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** structure.\n*   This constitutional analysis immediately eliminates options A and B, which have a `2,2,4,5-` substitution pattern that would arise from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either **C** or **D**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction: Stereoselectivity**\n\n*   **Rule:** The problem states that **inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is a classic Sₙ2 backside attack.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Original C1 (R) → New C1 (R)\n    *   Original C4 (R) → New C4 (R)\n    *   Original C3 (R) → New C5 (R)\n    *   So, the product must have the partial stereochemistry **(1R, ?, 4R, 5R)**. This is consistent with both options C and D.\n*   **Attacked Center:** The configuration at C6, which is **(S)** in the starting material, is inverted. The decision between C and D hinges on determining the correct R/S descriptor for this inverted center (which becomes C2 in the product).\n\n**4. Detailed Stereochemical Analysis of the Inversion**\n\nA simple assumption that (S) inverts to (R) can be misleading because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change. A more rigorous analysis is required.\n\n1.  **Visualize the Reactant:** Let's draw the molecule in a 2D representation with wedges (towards you) and dashes (away from you). To satisfy the (1R, 6S) stereochemistry, a valid representation places the epoxide oxygen on a wedge, the C1-methyl on a wedge, and the C6-hydrogen also on a wedge.\n    *   *Check C6*: Priorities are O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4). The path 1→2→3 is clockwise. With the lowest priority group (H) on a wedge (towards you), the configuration is correctly assigned as **(S)**.\n2.  **Visualize the Attack:** The Sₙ2 attack must occur from the side opposite the leaving group. Since the C6-O bond is on a wedge, the Me⁻ nucleophile attacks from the back, i.e., from the dash side.\n3.  **Visualize the Product:** The attack causes a Walden inversion. The hydrogen at C6, which was on a wedge, is pushed to the dash side. The new methyl group is now attached via a dash.\n4.  **Assign the New Configuration:** We now assign the configuration for the new C2 center.\n    *   The substituents are C1(OH), C3(old C5), the new Me, and H.\n    *   The CIP priorities are: C1(OH) is #1, C3 is #2, Me is #3, and H is #4.\n    *   The lowest priority group (H) is now on a dash (away from you).\n    *   We trace the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3. This path (C1 → C3 → Me) is **counter-clockwise**.\n    *   A counter-clockwise path with the lowest priority group pointing away corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The inversion of the (6S) center results in a **(2S)** center.\n*   Combining all the stereochemical information, the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. The reaction follows two key principles:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which causes a geometric inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n### 2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)\nThe first step is to identify which of the two epoxide carbons (C1 or C6) is less sterically hindered.\n*   **Carbon C1** is bonded to a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and H).\n\nA tertiary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Constitution of the Product\nThe attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring, adding a new methyl group to C6. After a standard aqueous workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1.\n*   Numbering the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2 (from the attack on C6), 4, and 5.\n*   This constitutional analysis eliminates options C and D, which have a different substitution pattern (`2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...`) that would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or B.\n\n### 4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\nThis is the most critical step and requires careful application of stereochemical rules.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations. In the product, these correspond to the new C1, C5, and C4, respectively.\n    *   Original C1 (**R**) → New C1 (**R**)\n    *   Original C4 (**R**) → New C4 (**R**)\n    *   Original C3 (**R**) → New C5 (**R**)\n*   **Attacked Center (Inversion):** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon, C6. The starting configuration is **(6S)**.\n\nA common mistake is to assume that a geometric inversion automatically flips the R/S descriptor (e.g., S becomes R). This is not always true because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change during the reaction.\n*   **At reactant C6:** The substituents are O, C1, C5, H. The leaving group (the epoxide oxygen) has the highest priority (1).\n*   **At product C2 (from C6):** The substituents are C1(OH), C3, Me, H. The incoming group (the methyl group) has a lower priority (3) than the adjacent ring carbons.\n\nBecause the highest priority group (the leaving group) is replaced by a group of lower priority (the nucleophile), the geometric inversion and the re-assignment of priorities result in the R/S descriptor being retained. Therefore, the **(S)** configuration at C6 becomes an **(S)** configuration at the new C2 center.\n\n### 5. Final Conclusion\nCombining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses:\n*   **Name:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, **2S**, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product, synthesizing the logic from the provided candidate answers and resolving their contradictions.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Reaction\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is an epoxide on a substituted cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem specifies the two governing rules for this reaction: regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n### 2. Regioselectivity: Determining the Site of Attack\n\nThe first rule states that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is bonded to a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   A tertiary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group attacks **C6**.\n\nThis conclusion determines the product's basic structure (its constitution). The attack at C6 adds a new methyl group to that carbon, and the epoxide opens to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. When renumbered according to IUPAC rules, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options C and D, which have a `2,2,4,5-` substitution pattern that would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or B.\n\n### 3. Stereoselectivity: Determining the 3D Arrangement\n\nThe second rule states that **inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is the defining feature of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n\n*   **Retention at Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Original C1 (**R**) → New C1 (**R**)\n    *   Original C4 (**R**) → New C4 (**R**)\n    *   Original C3 (**R**) → New C5 (**R**)\n    *   Therefore, the product's stereochemistry must be (1R, ?, 4R, 5R). Both options A and B fit this pattern.\n\n*   **Inversion at the Attacked Center (C6):** The configuration at C6, which is **(S)** in the starting material, is inverted. This is the most critical and often misunderstood step. A geometric inversion (like an umbrella flipping inside out) does not automatically mean the R/S descriptor flips from S to R. The descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents, which change during the reaction.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Priority Change:**\n        *   **At reactant C6:** The leaving group is the epoxide oxygen (-O-), which has the **highest priority (1)**.\n        *   **At product C2 (the old C6):** The incoming group is a methyl group (-CH₃), which has a **lower priority (3)** than the adjacent ring carbons.\n    *   **Consequence:** The Sₙ2 reaction replaces the highest priority group with a lower priority group. In such cases, the geometric inversion and the re-assignment of priorities often result in the R/S descriptor being retained. A detailed 3D analysis confirms that the geometric inversion of the (S) center at C6 results in a new stereocenter at C2 that is also assigned the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nBy combining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses, we can assemble the full name of the product:\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   C1 is **R** (retained).\n    *   C2 is **S** (inverted, but descriptor remains S due to priority changes).\n    *   C4 is **R** (retained).\n    *   C5 is **R** (retained).\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product for the given reaction.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Reaction\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem specifies the two key rules governing this reaction.\n\n### 2. Regioselectivity: Determining the Site of Attack\nThe first rule states that the nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is a **quaternary** carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group, the epoxide oxygen, and two other ring carbons (C2 and C6).\n*   **Carbon C6** is a **tertiary** carbon, as it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, the epoxide oxygen, and two other ring carbons (C1 and C5).\n*   A tertiary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group attacks carbon **C6**.\n\nThis determines the basic structure (constitution) of the product. The attack adds a methyl group to C6 and, after workup, forms a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. When renumbered according to IUPAC rules, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options C and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-) that would result from an attack at C1.\n\n### 3. Stereoselectivity: Determining the 3D Arrangement\nThe second rule states that **inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is a classic Sₙ2 \"backside attack\".\n\n*   **Unaffected Stereocenters:** The chiral centers not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Original C1 (**R**) → New C1 (**R**)\n    *   Original C4 (**R**) → New C4 (**R**)\n    *   Original C3 (**R**) → New C5 (**R**) (after renumbering)\n    *   So, the product must have the partial stereochemistry **(1R, ?, 4R, 5R)**. This is consistent with both remaining options, A and B.\n\n*   **The Inverted Stereocenter (C6):** This is the critical step.\n    *   The starting configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n    *   The Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (like an umbrella flipping inside out).\n    *   **Crucial Point:** A geometric inversion does not guarantee that the R/S descriptor will flip (e.g., S to R). The descriptor must be reassigned based on the new Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents.\n    *   **Analysis of Priority Change:**\n        *   At the reactant C6, the leaving group is the epoxide oxygen, which has the highest priority (1).\n        *   At the product C2 (the former C6), the incoming group is a methyl group, which has a lower priority (3) than the adjacent ring carbons.\n    *   Because the highest-priority group (1) is replaced by a lower-priority group (3), the geometric inversion and the change in CIP priorities effectively cancel each other out in terms of the final R/S descriptor. A detailed 3D analysis confirms that the geometric inversion of the (6S) center results in a new center that is also designated as **(S)**.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\nCombining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses:\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   C1 is **R** (retained).\n    *   C2 is **S** (inverted, but descriptor remains S due to priority changes).\n    *   C4 is **R** (retained).\n    *   C5 is **R** (retained).\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides two key rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\nThe first step is to identify which carbon of the epoxide (C1 or C6) is less sterically hindered.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\nThe attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. A new methyl group is added to C6, and the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after workup.\n*   To name the product via IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new C1. The ring is then numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n*   Numbering from the new C1 towards the original C6 (which now has the new methyl group) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   Therefore, the product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options C and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol) that would result from an attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or B.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\nThis is the deciding step between options A and B.\n*   **Retention at Unaffected Centers:** The configurations of the stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) are retained.\n    *   Reactant C1 (**R**) → Product C1 (**R**)\n    *   Reactant C3 (**R**) → Product C5 (**R**)\n    *   Reactant C4 (**R**) → Product C4 (**R**)\n*   **Inversion at the Attacked Center (C6):** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at C6. The starting configuration is **(S)**.\n\n**The Critical Point: Does Geometric Inversion Flip the R/S Descriptor?**\nA geometric inversion (like an umbrella flipping inside out) does not automatically mean the R/S descriptor will flip from S to R. The descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents, which change during the reaction.\n\n*   **At reactant C6:** The substituents are -O- (from epoxide), -C1-, -C5-, and -H. The priority order is: **O (1)** > C1 (2) > C5 (3) > H (4).\n*   **At product C2 (from C6):** The substituents are -C1(OH)-, -C3-, the new **-CH₃**, and -H. The priority order is: **C1 (1)** > C3 (2) > **CH₃ (3)** > H (4).\n\nThe Sₙ2 reaction replaces the highest priority group (-O-, rank 1) with a group of lower priority (-CH₃, rank 3). Because of this significant change in substituent priorities, the R/S descriptor must be re-evaluated carefully. A detailed 3D analysis shows that the geometric inversion of the (S) center at C6 results in a new stereocenter at C2 with an **(S)** configuration. The geometric inversion and the priority re-ordering effectively cancel each other out in terms of the final descriptor.\n\n**5.

The problem provides two key rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n### 2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)\nWe must compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is bonded to a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA tertiary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Constitution of the Product\nThe attack at C6 adds a methyl group to that position. The C6-O bond breaks, and after a standard aqueous workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol.\n\nTo name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), the ring is numbered counter-clockwise towards the newly methylated carbon.\n*   New C1 ← Old C1 (has a methyl group and the new -OH)\n*   New C2 ← Old C6 (has the new methyl group)\n*   New C4 ← Old C4 (has a methyl group)\n*   New C5 ← Old C3 (has a methyl group)\n\nThe methyl groups are located at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options B and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-), which would result from an attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or C.\n\n### 4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\nThis is the most critical step and requires careful application of the stereochemistry rules.\n\n*   **Unaffected Centers (C1, C3, C4):** The configurations of the stereocenters not directly involved in the nucleophilic attack are retained.\n    *   Reactant C1 (**R**) → Product C1 (**R**)\n    *   Reactant C3 (**R**) → Product C5 (**R**)\n    *   Reactant C4 (**R**) → Product C4 (**R**)\n    So, the product must have the partial configuration (1R, ?, 4R, 5R). This is consistent with both options A and C.\n\n*   **Attacked Center (C6):** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the site of attack. The starting configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n    *   A common mistake is to assume that a geometric inversion automatically flips the R/S descriptor (i.e., S becomes R). This is not always true because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n    *   **Analysis of Priority Change:**\n        *   **At reactant C6:** The leaving group is the epoxide oxygen, which has the highest priority (1).\n        *   **At product C2 (from C6):** The incoming group is a methyl group, which has a lower priority (3) than the adjacent ring carbons.\n    *   When the highest priority group is replaced by a lower priority group during an Sₙ2 inversion, the R/S descriptor is often retained, even though the 3D geometry has inverted. A detailed 3D analysis confirms this:\n        1.  The Sₙ2 attack occurs from the side opposite the C6-O bond.\n        2.  This causes a Walden inversion (the geometry flips like an umbrella in the wind).\n        3.  When the new C2 center's configuration is assigned using CIP rules, the combination of the geometric inversion and the change in substituent priorities results in an **(S)** configuration.\n\n### 5. Final Conclusion\nCombining the stereochemical results, the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this to the options:\n*   **A) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**\n*   B) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe derived product matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product for the given reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate, providing two key rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)\nTo apply the first rule, we must compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is bonded to a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and H).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Constitution of the Product\nThe site of attack determines the basic structure (constitution) of the product.\n*   The attack at C6 adds a methyl group to that position. The C6-O bond breaks, and after a standard aqueous workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol. To name it according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), the ring is numbered towards the newly methylated carbon.\n    *   New C1 ← Old C1\n    *   New C2 ← Old C6\n*   The methyl groups are located at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This constitutional analysis immediately eliminates options B and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-), which would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or C.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\nThis is the most critical step and will differentiate between options A and C.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the nucleophilic attack (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Reactant C1 (**R**) → Product C1 (**R**)\n    *   Reactant C4 (**R**) → Product C4 (**R**)\n    *   Reactant C3 (**R**) → Product C5 (**R**) (after IUPAC renumbering)\n    *   So, the product must have the configuration (1R, ?, 4R, 5R). Both options A and C satisfy this.\n\n*   **Attacked Center (C6):** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the site of attack. The starting configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n    *   An Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion). However, a common mistake is to assume that a geometric inversion automatically flips the R/S descriptor (e.g., S becomes R). This is not always true because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n    *   **Priority Analysis:**\n        *   At the reactant C6, the leaving group is the epoxide oxygen, which has the highest priority (1) of all substituents on C6.\n        *   At the product C2 (the former C6), the incoming group is a methyl group, which has a lower priority (3) than the adjacent ring carbons.\n    *   This significant change in priorities—replacing the highest priority group with a lower priority one—means the R/S descriptor must be carefully re-evaluated from the 3D structure. A detailed analysis shows that the geometric inversion of the (S) center results in a new stereocenter that is also designated as **(S)**. The spatial inversion and the change in priorities effectively cancel each other out in terms of the final CIP descriptor.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nCombining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses:\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, **2S**, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product for the given reaction.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Reaction and Reagents\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide, which follows specific rules for regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n### 2. Step 1: Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)\n\nThe problem states that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is a **quaternary** carbon because it is bonded to a methyl group, the epoxide oxygen, and two other ring carbons.\n*   **Carbon C6** is a **tertiary** carbon because it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, the epoxide oxygen, and two other ring carbons.\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack carbon **C6**.\n\nThis determines the constitutional isomer of the product. The attack adds a methyl group to C6 and, after workup, forms a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. When renumbered according to IUPAC rules, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options C and D, which have a 2,2,4,5- substitution pattern that would result from an attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or B.\n\n### 3. Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry\n\nThe problem states that the reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is a classic Sₙ2-type backside attack.\n\n*   **Unaffected Stereocenters:** The configurations at the stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) are **retained**.\n    *   The configuration at C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   The configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n    *   The configuration at C3 becomes the new C5, retaining its **(R)** configuration.\n    *   Therefore, the product must have the partial stereochemistry of (1R, ?, 4R, 5R). Both options A and B satisfy this.\n\n*   **Attacked Stereocenter (The Deciding Factor):** The configuration at C6, which is **(S)** in the starting material, is inverted. This carbon becomes C2 in the product.\n\n    *   **The Common Pitfall:** It is a common mistake to assume that a geometric inversion of an (S) center automatically results in an (R) center. The R/S descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents, which change during the reaction.\n    *   **Priority Analysis:**\n        *   At the reactant's C6, the leaving group (the epoxide oxygen) has the highest priority (Priority 1).\n        *   At the product's C2, the incoming nucleophile (the methyl group) has a lower priority (Priority 3) than the adjacent ring carbons.\n    *   **Conclusion on Inversion:** When a geometric inversion (like an umbrella flipping in the wind) is accompanied by this specific change in CIP priorities (replacing the #1 priority group with a lower priority group), the R/S descriptor does not change. The geometric inversion and the priority re-ordering cancel each other out in terms of the final R/S label.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at the attacked center, which starts as **(S)**, results in a new center that is also designated as **(S)**.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses:\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product for the given reaction.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reaction: Regioselectivity**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The substrate is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, an epoxide. The reagent is Me₂CuLi (a Gilman reagent), which provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Rule:** The problem states that the nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Application:** The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is a **quaternary** carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group, the epoxide oxygen, and two other ring carbons.\n    *   **C6** is a **tertiary** carbon, as it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, the epoxide oxygen, and two other ring carbons.\n*   **Conclusion:** The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1). Therefore, the methyl nucleophile attacks **C6**.\n\n**2. Determining the Product's Constitution**\n\n*   The attack at C6 adds a new methyl group to that position. The C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks, and after workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The resulting product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups. To name it according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group (the original C1) is designated as the new C1. The ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. This results in methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   The product's constitutional isomer is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This immediately eliminates options B and C, which have a `2,2,4,5-` substitution pattern that would arise from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or D.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction: Stereoselectivity**\n\n*   **Rule:** The problem states that **inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is the defining feature of an Sₙ2 reaction, which involves a backside attack.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Original C1 (**R**) → New C1 (**R**)\n    *   Original C3 (**R**) → New C5 (**R**)\n    *   Original C4 (**R**) → New C4 (**R**)\n*   **Attacked Center:** The nucleophilic attack occurs at C6, which has a starting configuration of **(S)**. This center undergoes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion).\n\n**4. The Critical Point: Assigning the Final R/S Descriptor**\n\n*   A geometric inversion does not automatically mean the R/S descriptor flips from S to R. The descriptor must be reassigned based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the new substituents.\n*   **Priorities at Reactant C6:** The substituents are O (epoxide), C1, C5, and H. The priority order is **O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4)**.\n*   **Priorities at Product C2 (from C6):** The substituents are C1(OH), C3(from C5), the new Me, and H. The priority order is **C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4)**.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction replaces the highest priority group (O, rank 1) with a group of lower priority (Me, rank 3). This significant change in substituent priorities means that the R/S descriptor does not flip, even though the 3D geometry of the center is inverted. A detailed 3D analysis confirms that the geometric inversion of the (S) center results in a new center that is also assigned the **(S)** descriptor.\n\n**5. Assembling the Final Product**\n\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   C1 is **R** (retained).\n    *   C2 is **S** (inverted, but descriptor remains S).\n    *   C4 is **R** (retained).\n    *   C5 is **R** (retained from C3).\n*   The full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis name matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

Analysis of Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide, providing two key rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Step 1: Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\nThis is the first critical decision and there is a clear consensus among all provided answers.\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to four non-hydrogen atoms).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon.\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group attacks carbon **C6**.\n\nThis regioselectivity determines the product's constitution. The attack adds a methyl group to C6 and creates a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. When renumbered according to IUPAC rules, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options A and C, which have a different substitution pattern (`2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`) that would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either B or D.\n\n**3. Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry**\nThis is the most complex part of the problem and the source of disagreement among the candidate answers.\n\n*   **Retention at Unreacted Centers:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Original C1 (**R**) → New C1 (**R**)\n    *   Original C4 (**R**) → New C4 (**R**)\n    *   Original C3 (**R**) → New C5 (**R**) (due to IUPAC renumbering)\n    *   Therefore, the product must have the partial configuration **(1R, ?, 4R, 5R)...**. Both remaining options, B and D, satisfy this condition.\n\n*   **Inversion at the Attacked Center (C6):** The reaction causes an inversion of configuration at C6. The starting configuration is **(6S)**. The critical question is what the R/S descriptor becomes after inversion. A simple flip of the letter (S → R) is a common mistake, as the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n\n    *   **Reactant C6 Priorities:** The groups are -O- (from epoxide), -C1-, -C5-, and -H. The priority order is: **O (1)** > C1 (2) > C5 (3) > H (4).\n    *   **Product C2 (from C6) Priorities:** The groups are -C1(OH)-, -C3(old C5)-, the new **-CH₃**, and -H.

This significant change in priorities requires a full 3D analysis (e.g., using chair conformations) to determine the final descriptor. A rigorous analysis of the trans-diaxial ring opening shows that while the 3D geometry at C6 inverts (a Walden inversion), the change in substituent priorities results in the new stereocenter at C2 having an **(S)** configuration. The majority of the provided answers that performed a detailed analysis correctly reached this conclusion.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   C1: **R** (retained)\n    *   C2: **S** (inverted from S, due to priority changes)\n    *   C4: **R** (retained)\n    *   C5: **R** (retained)\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect constitution.\nB) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\nC) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect constitution.\nD) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - **This matches the derived product exactly.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is an epoxide on a substituted cyclohexane ring, with the epoxide formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate) is a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide, providing two key rules: attack at the less hindered carbon and inversion of configuration at the site of attack.\n\n### 2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)\nThe first step is to identify which of the two epoxide carbons (C1 or C6) is less sterically hindered.\n*   **Carbon C1** is bonded to a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and H).\n\nA tertiary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Constitution of the Product\nThe attack at C6 adds a methyl group to that position and breaks the C6-O bond. After workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   To name the product using IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers, the ring is numbered towards the newly methylated carbon (the original C6), which becomes the new C2.\n*   The methyl groups are located at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   The product's constitutional isomer is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This immediately eliminates options B and C, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol) that would result from an attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or D.\n\n### 4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\nThis is the most critical step and requires careful analysis.\n*   **Retention at Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Original C1 (**R**) → New C1 (**R**)\n    *   Original C4 (**R**) → New C4 (**R**)\n    *   Original C3 (**R**) → New C5 (**R**)\n*   **Inversion at the Attacked Center:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon, C6. The starting configuration is **(S)**.\n\n**The Critical Point: Does Geometric Inversion Mean S → R?**\nA common mistake is to assume that an Sₙ2 inversion automatically flips the R/S descriptor (e.g., S becomes R). This is only true if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents remain in the same order. Here, they change significantly.\n\n*   **Priorities at Reactant C6:** The substituents are -O- (epoxide), -C1-, -C5-, and -H. The priority order is **O (1)** > C1 (2) > C5 (3) > H (4).\n*   **Priorities at Product C2 (from C6):** The substituents are -C1(OH)-, -C3(old C5)-, the new **-CH₃**, and -H. The priority order is **C1(OH) (1)** > C3 (2) > **CH₃ (3)** > H (4).\n\nThe reaction replaces the highest priority group (epoxide oxygen, rank 1) with a lower priority group (methyl, rank 3). Because of this significant change in priorities, a detailed 3D analysis is required to determine the final descriptor.\n\nA rigorous analysis shows that the geometric inversion (like an umbrella flipping inside out) combined with the re-ordering of substituent priorities results in the new stereocenter at C2 having an **(S)** configuration. The geometric inversion and the priority change effectively cancel each other out in terms of the final R/S label.\n\n### 5. Final Conclusion\nCombining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses:\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   C1 is **R** (retained).\n    *   C2 is **S** (inverted geometry, but S descriptor due to priority changes).\n    *   C4 is **R** (retained).\n    *   C5 is **R** (retained).\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reaction and Reactants**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide, providing two key rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\nThe first step is to identify which carbon of the epoxide (C1 or C6) is less sterically hindered.\n*   **Carbon C1** is bonded to a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA tertiary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\nThe site of attack determines the basic structure (constitution) of the product.\n*   The attack at C6 adds a methyl group to that position. The C6-O bond breaks, and after a standard aqueous workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups. To name it according to IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), the ring is numbered towards the newly methylated carbon.\n    *   New C1 ← Original C1\n    *   New C2 ← Original C6\n    *   New C4 ← Original C4\n    *   New C5 ← Original C3\n*   The methyl groups are located at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This constitutional analysis immediately eliminates options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-). The correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\nThis is the most critical step and will differentiate between options B and C.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The configurations of the stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) are **retained**.\n    *   Original C1 (**R**) → New C1 (**R**)\n    *   Original C3 (**R**) → New C5 (**R**)\n    *   Original C4 (**R**) → New C4 (**R**)\n    *   So far, the product has the configuration (1R, ?, 4R, 5R). This is consistent with both options B and C.\n\n*   **Attacked Center (C6):** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the site of attack. The starting configuration at C6 is **(S)**. The key question is whether the geometric inversion of a (6S) center results in a (2R) or a (2S) center in the product.\n    *   A simple assumption that an (S) center always inverts to an (R) center is a common mistake. The R/S descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents, which change during the reaction.\n    *   **At reactant C6:** The substituents are O, C1, C5, H. The priorities are **O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4)**.\n    *   **At product C2 (from C6):** The substituents are C1(OH), C3(from C5), Me, H. The priorities are **C1(OH)(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4)**.\n    *   The Sₙ2 reaction replaces the highest priority group (-O-, rank 1) with a group of lower priority (-CH₃, rank 3). In such cases, a geometric inversion (Walden inversion) often results in the **retention of the R/S descriptor**. A detailed 3D analysis confirms that the geometric inversion of the (S) center at C6 results in a new stereocenter at C2 with an **(S)** configuration.\n\n**5.

Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Rules:** The problem explicitly states the rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\nThe first step is to identify which carbon of the epoxide (C1 or C6) is less sterically hindered.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\nThe attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. A new methyl group is added to C6, and the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after workup.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new C1. The ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n*   The attack at C6 results in a product where the methyl groups are on adjacent carbons (the original C1 and C6). The IUPAC name for this substitution pattern is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This constitutional structure eliminates options A and D, which are named as `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. This incorrect pattern would result from an attack at C1.\n*   Therefore, the correct answer must be either **B** or **C**.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\nThis is the deciding step between options B and C. We apply the rules of stereochemistry.\n*   **Retention at Unreacted Centers:** The configurations at the stereocenters not directly attacked are retained.\n    *   Original C1 was **(R)**. It becomes the new C1, so the product is **(1R)**.\n    *   Original C4 was **(R)**. It becomes the new C4, so the product is **(4R)**.\n    *   Original C3 was **(R)**. It becomes the new C5, so the product is **(5R)**.\n    *   So far, the product has the partial configuration: **(1R, ?, 4R, 5R)**. This is consistent with both options B and C.\n\n*   **Inversion at the Attacked Center (The Critical Point):**\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of **(S)**.\n    *   The Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion). However, the R/S descriptor does not automatically flip from S to R. The descriptor must be reassigned based on the new set of substituents and their Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities.\n    *   **Priority Analysis:**\n        *   At reactant C6, the leaving group (the epoxide oxygen) has the highest priority (#1).\n        *   At product C2 (the old C6), the incoming group (the new methyl group) has a lower priority (#3) than the adjacent ring carbons.\n    *   Because the highest priority group is replaced by a lower priority group, the geometric inversion and the change in CIP priorities effectively cancel each other out in terms of the final R/S descriptor. A detailed 3D analysis confirms that the geometric inversion of the (S) center at C6 results in a new stereocenter at C2 that is also designated as **(S)**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nCombining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses:\n*   **Name:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reaction: Regioselectivity**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The substrate is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, and the reagent is Me₂CuLi (a Gilman reagent), which provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Rule:** The problem states that the nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Analysis:** The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is a **quaternary** carbon because it is bonded to a methyl group, the epoxide oxygen, and two other ring carbons.\n    *   **C6** is a **tertiary** carbon because it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, the epoxide oxygen, and two other ring carbons.\n*   **Conclusion:** The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1). Therefore, the methyl nucleophile attacks **C6**.\n\n**2. Determine the Product's Constitution**\n\n*   The attack at C6 adds a new methyl group to that position. The C6-O bond breaks, and after workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups. To name it according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1. The ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. This results in a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** structure.\n*   This constitutional analysis immediately eliminates options A and B, which have a `2,2,4,5-` substitution pattern that would arise from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either **C** or **D**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction: Stereoselectivity**\n\n*   **Rule:** The problem states that **inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is a classic Sₙ2 backside attack.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Original C1 (R) → New C1 (R)\n    *   Original C4 (R) → New C4 (R)\n    *   Original C3 (R) → New C5 (R)\n    *   So, the product must have the partial stereochemistry **(1R, ?, 4R, 5R)**. This is consistent with both options C and D.\n*   **Attacked Center:** The configuration at C6, which is **(S)** in the starting material, is inverted. The decision between C and D hinges on determining the correct R/S descriptor for this inverted center (which becomes C2 in the product).\n\n**4. Detailed Stereochemical Analysis of the Inversion**\n\nA simple assumption that (S) inverts to (R) can be misleading because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change. A more rigorous analysis is required.\n\n1.  **Visualize the Reactant:** Let's draw the molecule in a 2D representation with wedges (towards you) and dashes (away from you). To satisfy the (1R, 6S) stereochemistry, a valid representation places the epoxide oxygen on a wedge, the C1-methyl on a wedge, and the C6-hydrogen also on a wedge.\n    *   *Check C6*: Priorities are O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4). The path 1→2→3 is clockwise. With the lowest priority group (H) on a wedge (towards you), the configuration is correctly assigned as **(S)**.\n2.  **Visualize the Attack:** The Sₙ2 attack must occur from the side opposite the leaving group. Since the C6-O bond is on a wedge, the Me⁻ nucleophile attacks from the back, i.e., from the dash side.\n3.  **Visualize the Product:** The attack causes a Walden inversion. The hydrogen at C6, which was on a wedge, is pushed to the dash side. The new methyl group is now attached via a dash.\n4.  **Assign the New Configuration:** We now assign the configuration for the new C2 center.\n    *   The substituents are C1(OH), C3(old C5), the new Me, and H.\n    *   The CIP priorities are: C1(OH) is #1, C3 is #2, Me is #3, and H is #4.\n    *   The lowest priority group (H) is now on a dash (away from you).\n    *   We trace the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3. This path (C1 → C3 → Me) is **counter-clockwise**.\n    *   A counter-clockwise path with the lowest priority group pointing away corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The inversion of the (6S) center results in a **(2S)** center.\n*   Combining all the stereochemical information, the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. The reaction follows two key principles:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which causes a geometric inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n### 2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)\nThe first step is to identify which of the two epoxide carbons (C1 or C6) is less sterically hindered.\n*   **Carbon C1** is bonded to a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and H).\n\nA tertiary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Constitution of the Product\nThe attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring, adding a new methyl group to C6. After a standard aqueous workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1.\n*   Numbering the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2 (from the attack on C6), 4, and 5.\n*   This constitutional analysis eliminates options C and D, which have a different substitution pattern (`2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...`) that would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or B.\n\n### 4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\nThis is the most critical step and requires careful application of stereochemical rules.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations. In the product, these correspond to the new C1, C5, and C4, respectively.\n    *   Original C1 (**R**) → New C1 (**R**)\n    *   Original C4 (**R**) → New C4 (**R**)\n    *   Original C3 (**R**) → New C5 (**R**)\n*   **Attacked Center (Inversion):** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon, C6. The starting configuration is **(6S)**.\n\nA common mistake is to assume that a geometric inversion automatically flips the R/S descriptor (e.g., S becomes R). This is not always true because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change during the reaction.\n*   **At reactant C6:** The substituents are O, C1, C5, H. The leaving group (the epoxide oxygen) has the highest priority (1).\n*   **At product C2 (from C6):** The substituents are C1(OH), C3, Me, H. The incoming group (the methyl group) has a lower priority (3) than the adjacent ring carbons.\n\nBecause the highest priority group (the leaving group) is replaced by a group of lower priority (the nucleophile), the geometric inversion and the re-assignment of priorities result in the R/S descriptor being retained. Therefore, the **(S)** configuration at C6 becomes an **(S)** configuration at the new C2 center.\n\n### 5. Final Conclusion\nCombining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses:\n*   **Name:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, **2S**, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.

Analysis of the Reaction\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is an epoxide on a substituted cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem specifies the two governing rules for this reaction: regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n### 2. Regioselectivity: Determining the Site of Attack\n\nThe first rule states that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is bonded to a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   A tertiary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group attacks **C6**.\n\nThis conclusion determines the product's basic structure (its constitution). The attack at C6 adds a new methyl group to that carbon, and the epoxide opens to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. When renumbered according to IUPAC rules, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options C and D, which have a `2,2,4,5-` substitution pattern that would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or B.\n\n### 3. Stereoselectivity: Determining the 3D Arrangement\n\nThe second rule states that **inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is the defining feature of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n\n*   **Retention at Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Original C1 (**R**) → New C1 (**R**)\n    *   Original C4 (**R**) → New C4 (**R**)\n    *   Original C3 (**R**) → New C5 (**R**)\n    *   Therefore, the product's stereochemistry must be (1R, ?, 4R, 5R). Both options A and B fit this pattern.\n\n*   **Inversion at the Attacked Center (C6):** The configuration at C6, which is **(S)** in the starting material, is inverted. This is the most critical and often misunderstood step. A geometric inversion (like an umbrella flipping inside out) does not automatically mean the R/S descriptor flips from S to R. The descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents, which change during the reaction.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Priority Change:**\n        *   **At reactant C6:** The leaving group is the epoxide oxygen (-O-), which has the **highest priority (1)**.\n        *   **At product C2 (the old C6):** The incoming group is a methyl group (-CH₃), which has a **lower priority (3)** than the adjacent ring carbons.\n    *   **Consequence:** The Sₙ2 reaction replaces the highest priority group with a lower priority group. In such cases, the geometric inversion and the re-assignment of priorities often result in the R/S descriptor being retained. A detailed 3D analysis confirms that the geometric inversion of the (S) center at C6 results in a new stereocenter at C2 that is also assigned the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nBy combining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses, we can assemble the full name of the product:\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   C1 is **R** (retained).\n    *   C2 is **S** (inverted, but descriptor remains S due to priority changes).\n    *   C4 is **R** (retained).\n    *   C5 is **R** (retained).\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product for the given reaction.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Reaction\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem specifies the two key rules governing this reaction.\n\n### 2. Regioselectivity: Determining the Site of Attack\nThe first rule states that the nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is a **quaternary** carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group, the epoxide oxygen, and two other ring carbons (C2 and C6).\n*   **Carbon C6** is a **tertiary** carbon, as it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, the epoxide oxygen, and two other ring carbons (C1 and C5).\n*   A tertiary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group attacks carbon **C6**.\n\nThis determines the basic structure (constitution) of the product. The attack adds a methyl group to C6 and, after workup, forms a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. When renumbered according to IUPAC rules, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options C and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-) that would result from an attack at C1.\n\n### 3. Stereoselectivity: Determining the 3D Arrangement\nThe second rule states that **inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is a classic Sₙ2 \"backside attack\".\n\n*   **Unaffected Stereocenters:** The chiral centers not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Original C1 (**R**) → New C1 (**R**)\n    *   Original C4 (**R**) → New C4 (**R**)\n    *   Original C3 (**R**) → New C5 (**R**) (after renumbering)\n    *   So, the product must have the partial stereochemistry **(1R, ?, 4R, 5R)**. This is consistent with both remaining options, A and B.\n\n*   **The Inverted Stereocenter (C6):** This is the critical step.\n    *   The starting configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n    *   The Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (like an umbrella flipping inside out).\n    *   **Crucial Point:** A geometric inversion does not guarantee that the R/S descriptor will flip (e.g., S to R). The descriptor must be reassigned based on the new Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents.\n    *   **Analysis of Priority Change:**\n        *   At the reactant C6, the leaving group is the epoxide oxygen, which has the highest priority (1).\n        *   At the product C2 (the former C6), the incoming group is a methyl group, which has a lower priority (3) than the adjacent ring carbons.\n    *   Because the highest-priority group (1) is replaced by a lower-priority group (3), the geometric inversion and the change in CIP priorities effectively cancel each other out in terms of the final R/S descriptor. A detailed 3D analysis confirms that the geometric inversion of the (6S) center results in a new center that is also designated as **(S)**.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\nCombining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses:\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   C1 is **R** (retained).\n    *   C2 is **S** (inverted, but descriptor remains S due to priority changes).\n    *   C4 is **R** (retained).\n    *   C5 is **R** (retained).\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides two key rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\nThe first step is to identify which carbon of the epoxide (C1 or C6) is less sterically hindered.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\nThe attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. A new methyl group is added to C6, and the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after workup.\n*   To name the product via IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new C1. The ring is then numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n*   Numbering from the new C1 towards the original C6 (which now has the new methyl group) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   Therefore, the product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options C and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol) that would result from an attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or B.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\nThis is the deciding step between options A and B.\n*   **Retention at Unaffected Centers:** The configurations of the stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) are retained.\n    *   Reactant C1 (**R**) → Product C1 (**R**)\n    *   Reactant C3 (**R**) → Product C5 (**R**)\n    *   Reactant C4 (**R**) → Product C4 (**R**)\n*   **Inversion at the Attacked Center (C6):** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at C6. The starting configuration is **(S)**.\n\n**The Critical Point: Does Geometric Inversion Flip the R/S Descriptor?**\nA geometric inversion (like an umbrella flipping inside out) does not automatically mean the R/S descriptor will flip from S to R. The descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents, which change during the reaction.\n\n*   **At reactant C6:** The substituents are -O- (from epoxide), -C1-, -C5-, and -H. The priority order is: **O (1)** > C1 (2) > C5 (3) > H (4).\n*   **At product C2 (from C6):** The substituents are -C1(OH)-, -C3-, the new **-CH₃**, and -H. The priority order is: **C1 (1)** > C3 (2) > **CH₃ (3)** > H (4).\n\nThe Sₙ2 reaction replaces the highest priority group (-O-, rank 1) with a group of lower priority (-CH₃, rank 3). Because of this significant change in substituent priorities, the R/S descriptor must be re-evaluated carefully. A detailed 3D analysis shows that the geometric inversion of the (S) center at C6 results in a new stereocenter at C2 with an **(S)** configuration. The geometric inversion and the priority re-ordering effectively cancel each other out in terms of the final descriptor.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nCombining the stereochemical results, the final product is:\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.

Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n*   The attack at C6 adds a methyl group to that position. The C6-O bond breaks, and after workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol. To name it according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), the ring is numbered towards the newly methylated carbon.\n    *   New C1 ← Old C1 (has a methyl group)\n    *   New C2 ← Old C6 (has the new methyl group)\n    *   New C4 ← Old C4 (has a methyl group)\n    *   New C5 ← Old C3 (has a methyl group)\n*   The product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.

Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)\nWe must compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is bonded to a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA tertiary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Constitution of the Product\nThe attack at C6 adds a methyl group to that position. The C6-O bond breaks, and after a standard aqueous workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol.\n\nTo name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1.

Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\nThis is the most critical step and requires careful application of the stereochemistry rules.\n\n*   **Unaffected Centers (C1, C3, C4):** The configurations of the stereocenters not directly involved in the nucleophilic attack are retained.\n    *   Reactant C1 (**R**) → Product C1 (**R**)\n    *   Reactant C3 (**R**) → Product C5 (**R**)\n    *   Reactant C4 (**R**) → Product C4 (**R**)\n    So, the product must have the partial configuration (1R, ?, 4R, 5R). This is consistent with both options A and C.\n\n*   **Attacked Center (C6):** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the site of attack. The starting configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n    *   A common mistake is to assume that a geometric inversion automatically flips the R/S descriptor (i.e., S becomes R). This is not always true because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n    *   **Analysis of Priority Change:**\n        *   **At reactant C6:** The leaving group is the epoxide oxygen, which has the highest priority (1).\n        *   **At product C2 (from C6):** The incoming group is a methyl group, which has a lower priority (3) than the adjacent ring carbons.\n    *   When the highest priority group is replaced by a lower priority group during an Sₙ2 inversion, the R/S descriptor is often retained, even though the 3D geometry has inverted. A detailed 3D analysis confirms this:\n        1.  The Sₙ2 attack occurs from the side opposite the C6-O bond.\n        2.  This causes a Walden inversion (the geometry flips like an umbrella in the wind).\n        3.  When the new C2 center's configuration is assigned using CIP rules, the combination of the geometric inversion and the change in substituent priorities results in an **(S)** configuration.\n\n### 5.

Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Constitution of the Product\nThe site of attack determines the basic structure (constitution) of the product.\n*   The attack at C6 adds a methyl group to that position. The C6-O bond breaks, and after a standard aqueous workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol. To name it according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), the ring is numbered towards the newly methylated carbon.\n    *   New C1 ← Old C1\n    *   New C2 ← Old C6\n*   The methyl groups are located at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This constitutional analysis immediately eliminates options B and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-), which would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or C.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\nThis is the most critical step and will differentiate between options A and C.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the nucleophilic attack (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Reactant C1 (**R**) → Product C1 (**R**)\n    *   Reactant C4 (**R**) → Product C4 (**R**)\n    *   Reactant C3 (**R**) → Product C5 (**R**) (after IUPAC renumbering)\n    *   So, the product must have the configuration (1R, ?, 4R, 5R). Both options A and C satisfy this.\n\n*   **Attacked Center (C6):** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the site of attack. The starting configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n    *   An Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion). However, a common mistake is to assume that a geometric inversion automatically flips the R/S descriptor (e.g., S becomes R). This is not always true because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n    *   **Priority Analysis:**\n        *   At the reactant C6, the leaving group is the epoxide oxygen, which has the highest priority (1) of all substituents on C6.\n        *   At the product C2 (the former C6), the incoming group is a methyl group, which has a lower priority (3) than the adjacent ring carbons.\n    *   This significant change in priorities—replacing the highest priority group with a lower priority one—means the R/S descriptor must be carefully re-evaluated from the 3D structure. A detailed analysis shows that the geometric inversion of the (S) center results in a new stereocenter that is also designated as **(S)**. The spatial inversion and the change in priorities effectively cancel each other out in terms of the final CIP descriptor.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nCombining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses:\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, **2S**, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product for the given reaction.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Reaction and Reagents\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide, which follows specific rules for regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n### 2. Step 1: Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)\n\nThe problem states that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is a **quaternary** carbon because it is bonded to a methyl group, the epoxide oxygen, and two other ring carbons.\n*   **Carbon C6** is a **tertiary** carbon because it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, the epoxide oxygen, and two other ring carbons.\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack carbon **C6**.\n\nThis determines the constitutional isomer of the product. The attack adds a methyl group to C6 and, after workup, forms a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. When renumbered according to IUPAC rules, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options C and D, which have a 2,2,4,5- substitution pattern that would result from an attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or B.\n\n### 3. Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry\n\nThe problem states that the reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is a classic Sₙ2-type backside attack.\n\n*   **Unaffected Stereocenters:** The configurations at the stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) are **retained**.\n    *   The configuration at C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   The configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n    *   The configuration at C3 becomes the new C5, retaining its **(R)** configuration.\n    *   Therefore, the product must have the partial stereochemistry of (1R, ?, 4R, 5R). Both options A and B satisfy this.\n\n*   **Attacked Stereocenter (The Deciding Factor):** The configuration at C6, which is **(S)** in the starting material, is inverted. This carbon becomes C2 in the product.\n\n    *   **The Common Pitfall:** It is a common mistake to assume that a geometric inversion of an (S) center automatically results in an (R) center. The R/S descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents, which change during the reaction.\n    *   **Priority Analysis:**\n        *   At the reactant's C6, the leaving group (the epoxide oxygen) has the highest priority (Priority 1).\n        *   At the product's C2, the incoming nucleophile (the methyl group) has a lower priority (Priority 3) than the adjacent ring carbons.\n    *   **Conclusion on Inversion:** When a geometric inversion (like an umbrella flipping in the wind) is accompanied by this specific change in CIP priorities (replacing the #1 priority group with a lower priority group), the R/S descriptor does not change. The geometric inversion and the priority re-ordering cancel each other out in terms of the final R/S label.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at the attacked center, which starts as **(S)**, results in a new center that is also designated as **(S)**.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the constitutional and stereochemical analyses:\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product for the given reaction.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reaction: Regioselectivity**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The substrate is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, an epoxide. The reagent is Me₂CuLi (a Gilman reagent), which provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Rule:** The problem states that the nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Application:** The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is a **quaternary** carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group, the epoxide oxygen, and two other ring carbons.\n    *   **C6** is a **tertiary** carbon, as it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, the epoxide oxygen, and two other ring carbons.\n*   **Conclusion:** The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1). Therefore, the methyl nucleophile attacks **C6**.\n\n**2. Determining the Product's Constitution**\n\n*   The attack at C6 adds a new methyl group to that position. The C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks, and after workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The resulting product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups. To name it according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group (the original C1) is designated as the new C1. The ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. This results in methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   The product's constitutional isomer is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This immediately eliminates options B and C, which have a `2,2,4,5-` substitution pattern that would arise from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or D.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction: Stereoselectivity**\n\n*   **Rule:** The problem states that **inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is the defining feature of an Sₙ2 reaction, which involves a backside attack.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Original C1 (**R**) → New C1 (**R**)\n    *   Original C3 (**R**) → New C5 (**R**)\n    *   Original C4 (**R**) → New C4 (**R**)\n*   **Attacked Center:** The nucleophilic attack occurs at C6, which has a starting configuration of **(S)**. This center undergoes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion).\n\n**4. The Critical Point: Assigning the Final R/S Descriptor**\n\n*   A geometric inversion does not automatically mean the R/S descriptor flips from S to R. The descriptor must be reassigned based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the new substituents.\n*   **Priorities at Reactant C6:** The substituents are O (epoxide), C1, C5, and H. The priority order is **O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4)**.\n*   **Priorities at Product C2 (from C6):** The substituents are C1(OH), C3(from C5), the new Me, and H. The priority order is **C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4)**.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction replaces the highest priority group (O, rank 1) with a group of lower priority (Me, rank 3). This significant change in substituent priorities means that the R/S descriptor does not flip, even though the 3D geometry of the center is inverted. A detailed 3D analysis confirms that the geometric inversion of the (S) center results in a new center that is also assigned the **(S)** descriptor.\n\n**5. Assembling the Final Product**\n\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   C1 is **R** (retained).\n    *   C2 is **S** (inverted, but descriptor remains S).\n    *   C4 is **R** (retained).\n    *   C5 is **R** (retained from C3).\n*   The full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis name matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
