    "Here is the step-by-step calculation for the enthalpy of neutralization:\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of H+ ions from the acids:**\n\n*   **From HCl:** Moles = Volume (L) × Molarity (mol/L)\n    Moles of H+ = 0.500 L × 0.2 M = 0.10 mol\n*   **From H2SO4:** H2SO4 is a strong acid that provides two H+ ions per molecule.\n    Moles of H+ = 0.300 L × 0.3 M × 2 = 0.18 mol\n*   **Total moles of H+:** 0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = 0.28 mol\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of OH- ions from the base:**\n\n*   **From Ba(OH)2:** Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that provides two OH- ions per molecule.\n    Moles of OH- = 0.200 L × 0.5 M × 2 = 0.20 mol\n\n**3. Determine the limiting reactant for the neutralization reaction:**\n\nThe neutralization reaction is: H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2O (l)\nWe are comparing 0.28 moles of H+ with 0.20 moles of OH-. The hydroxide ion (OH-) is the limiting reactant, as there are fewer moles of it. Therefore, the reaction will consume all 0.20 moles of OH- and will produce 0.20 moles of water.\n\n**4. Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization:**\n\nThe standard enthalpy of neutralization for the reaction between a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -13.7 kcal/mol of water formed. This value represents the heat released when one mole of water is produced. Some sources also cite the value as -13.6 kcal/mol.\n\nUsing this value, the total enthalpy change (ΔH) is:\nΔH = Moles of water formed × Enthalpy of neutralization per mole\nΔH = 0.20 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol)\nΔH = -2.72 kcal\n\nIt is important to note that a precipitation reaction also occurs:\nBa2+ (aq) + SO4^2- (aq) → BaSO4 (s)\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks for the \"enthalpy of neutralization,\" which typically refers only to the heat evolved from the formation of water. Based on the provided options, the calculation that considers only the acid-base neutralization is the correct one.\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of neutralization is -2.72 kcal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
