    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming a uniform distribution of stars in the sky.\n\n1.  **Relationship between Distance and Parallax:** The parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. This relationship can be expressed as:\n    *   d ∝ 1/plx\n    *   Where 'd' is the distance to the star and 'plx' is its parallax.\n\n2.  **Uniform Distribution of Stars:** The assumption that stars are uniformly distributed means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's denote this constant stellar density as 'ρ'.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars within a Certain Distance:** For a uniform distribution, the total number of stars (N) within a sphere of radius 'd' is the stellar density multiplied by the volume of the sphere (V = 4/3 * π * d³).\n    *   N(d) = ρ * (4/3 * π * d³)\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars up to a distance 'd' is proportional to the cube of the distance: N ∝ d³.\n\n4.  **Number of Stars in a Thin Spherical Shell:** To find the number of stars at a particular distance, we can consider a thin spherical shell at a distance 'd' with a small thickness 'dd'. The volume of this shell (dV) is approximately its surface area (4 * π * d²) multiplied by its thickness (dd).\n    *   dV = 4 * π * d² * dd\n    *   The number of stars (dN) in this shell is: dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd.\n\n5.  **Relating the Number of Stars to Parallax:** Now, we need to express the number of stars in terms of parallax. We start with the relationship d = 1/plx. To find the change in distance with respect to the change in parallax, we differentiate 'd' with respect to 'plx':\n    *   dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²\n    *   So, dd = -d(plx)/plx². The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For our purpose of counting stars in a parallax range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can use |dd| = d(plx)/plx².\n\n6.  **Substituting into the Number of Stars Equation:** We can now substitute the expressions for 'd' and 'dd' in terms of 'plx' into our equation for the number of stars in a thin shell (dN):\n    *   dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)² * (d(plx)/plx²)\n    *   dN = (4 * π * ρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)\n\n7.  **Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is dN/d(plx). From the equation above, we can see that:\n    *   dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<C>>>"
