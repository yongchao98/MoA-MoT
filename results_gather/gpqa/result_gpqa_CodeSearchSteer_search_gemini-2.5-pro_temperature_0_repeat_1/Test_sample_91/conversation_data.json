    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we can use the provided bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. The general principle is that the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the enthalpies of atomization of the constituent elements in their standard states minus the sum of the bond energies of the product molecule.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n*   **Carbons (C):** 2 (from the first (CH3)2) + 1 (C=) + 1 (=CH) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 1 (in the CH3 group) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH=) + 1 (=C) + 2 (from the second (CH3)2) = 12 carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nThe molar mass is approximately (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = **166 g/mol**.\n\n**2. Count the Number and Types of Bonds**\n\nNext, we count all the covalent bonds in one molecule:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** Counting the single bonds between carbon atoms:\n    *   2 in (CH3)2C=\n    *   1 between =CH- and -CH2-\n    *   1 between -CH2- and -CH(CH3)-\n    *   1 between the main chain and the CH3 group\n    *   1 between -CH(CH3)- and -CH2-\n    *   1 between -CH2- and -CH=\n    *   2 in =C(CH3)2\n    *   This gives a total of **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization**\n\nThis is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states (C(s) and H2(g)).\n*   **For Carbon:** 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **For Hydrogen:** To get 22 moles of H atoms, we need 11 moles of H2 molecules. The energy required is 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization:** 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Molecule**\n\nThis is the energy released when forming all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous molecule.\n*   **Energy from C-C bonds:** 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   **Energy from C=C bonds:** 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   **Energy from C-H bonds:** 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   **Total Bond Energy:** 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released when forming the molecule's bonds.\n*   **ΔH_f (kJ/mol):** 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options include units of kJ/g, so we convert our result using the molar mass.\n*   **ΔH_f (kJ/g):** (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
