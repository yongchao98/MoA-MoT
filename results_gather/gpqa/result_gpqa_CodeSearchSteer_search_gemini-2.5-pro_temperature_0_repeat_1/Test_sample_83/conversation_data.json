    "When solving higher-dimensional heat equations, the problem can be transformed into a system of ordinary differential equations of the form `dU/dt = AU + v(t)`, where `U` is a vector of the solution at different spatial points. The solution to this system involves the matrix exponential function, `exp(lA)`, where `l` is the time step.\n\nFor parallel processing, the matrix exponential function is approximated by a rational function. The key to converting the sequential algorithm into a parallel one lies in the mathematical decomposition of this rational function. Specifically, if the rational approximation is chosen to have distinct real poles (roots of the denominator), it can be broken down into a sum of simpler terms using partial fraction decomposition.\n\nThis decomposition allows the single, complex matrix operation to be split into several smaller, independent linear systems. Each of these smaller systems can then be solved concurrently on a separate processor. This process of decomposing the problem into independent tasks that can be executed simultaneously is the fundamental principle behind converting the sequential algorithm into a parallel one.\n\nTherefore, the linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation is the key factor that enables this parallelization.\n\n<<<B>>>"
