    "Based on the principles of particle and condensed matter physics, the association of each particle with spontaneously broken symmetry is as follows:\n\n*   **A) Magnon:** Magnons are the quantized spin waves that propagate in a magnetically ordered material. Their existence is a direct consequence of the spontaneous breaking of continuous rotational symmetry in ferromagnets and other magnetic materials. They are the Nambu-Goldstone bosons of this broken symmetry.\n\n*   **B) Phonon:** Phonons are the quantized modes of vibration in a crystal lattice. The formation of a crystal itself breaks the continuous translational symmetry of free space. Phonons are the Nambu-Goldstone bosons that arise from this spontaneously broken translational symmetry.\n\n*   **D) Pion:** Pions are subatomic particles that are understood in the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are the (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone bosons that result from the spontaneous breaking of the approximate axial or chiral symmetry of the strong interaction. This symmetry would be exact if the up and down quarks were massless, and in that limit, the pions would also be massless.\n\n*   **C) Skyrmion:** A skyrmion is a topologically stable, particle-like excitation in a field. In magnetism, skyrmions are localized, swirling magnetic textures. While their formation is related to broken symmetries, such as broken inversion symmetry in certain magnetic materials, they are not the Nambu-Goldstone bosons that are the hallmark of a spontaneously broken *continuous* symmetry. Instead, they are topological solitons, which are stable, massive configurations. The other three particles are the direct, low-energy excitations (bosons) that necessarily appear when a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken.\n\nTherefore, the skyrmion is the particle in this list that is not a direct consequence (as a Goldstone boson) of a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
