    "The problem asks for the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product obtained from the reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n### Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the starting material.\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group, which is the principal functional group and is assigned to position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group at position 5.\n\nBased on this, the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula CₐHₙOₑ using the formula: IHD = a - (n/2) + 1.\nFor the starting material (C₁₀H₁₂O₃):\nIHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the C=C double bond within the ring.\n*   1 for the C=C double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the formyl group.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\nTotal = 5.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the reaction and the product.\n\nThe reagent used is red phosphorus with an excess of HI. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce several functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes.\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehyde (-CHO)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes (C=C)** are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n*   **Alcohols (-OH)** are also reduced to alkanes.\n\nApplying this to the starting material:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group at position 1 is reduced to a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group at position 2 is reduced to a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group at position 5 is reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is **1-ethyl-2,4-dimethylcyclohexane** (based on IUPAC naming of the product, though the specific isomerism isn't critical for the formula). Let's re-evaluate the product name based on the starting material's numbering: the product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of the product.\n\nThe product is a saturated cycloalkane with substituents.\n*   The cyclohexane ring has 6 carbon atoms.\n*   Two methyl groups (-CH₃) add 2 carbon atoms.\n*   One ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) adds 2 carbon atoms.\n*   Total carbons = 6 + 2 + 2 = 10 (C₁₀).\n\nThe general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) is CₙH₂ₙ.\nFor our product with 10 carbon atoms, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\nUsing the IHD formula for the product (C₁₀H₂₀):\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThis IHD of 1 is accounted for by the single ring structure of the cyclohexane. Since all double bonds and oxygen-containing functional groups have been reduced, the only remaining feature contributing to hydrogen deficiency compared to an acyclic alkane (C₁₀H₂₂) is the ring itself.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
