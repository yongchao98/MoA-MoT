  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    "To determine the reason for the failed protein overexpression, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed in the context of the experimental design.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experiment:**\n    *   **Gene:** GADD45G\n    *   **Tag:** Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. The amino acid sequence for this tag is YPYDVPDYA.\n    *   **Structure:** The construct should start with a start codon (ATG), followed by the sequence for the HA tag, and then the coding sequence for the GADD45G protein.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Provided DNA Sequence:**\n    `5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGC...`\n\n3.  **Translate the Initial Part of the Sequence:**\n    *   The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the universal start codon, coding for Methionine (M).\n    *   The next codons are `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`. Translating these gives the amino acid sequence: Tyrosine (Y) - Proline (P) - Tyrosine (Y) - Aspartic Acid (D) - Valine (V) - Proline (P) - Aspartic Acid (D) - Tyrosine (Y) - Alanine (A).\n    *   This sequence, `MYPYDVPDYA`, corresponds to the Methionine start codon followed by the correct HA tag sequence. So far, the construct appears correct.\n\n4.  **Examine the Sequence Immediately After the HA Tag:**\n    *   The sequence continues: `AAA TGA...`\n    *   The codon `AAA` codes for the amino acid Lysine (K).\n    *   The next codon is `TGA`. In the standard genetic code, `TGA` is one of the three stop codons (along with `TAA` and `TAG`).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The ribosome initiates translation at the `ATG` start codon, correctly synthesizes the HA tag, and adds one more amino acid (Lysine). It then immediately encounters the `TGA` stop codon. This signal causes the ribosome to detach from the mRNA and release the incomplete polypeptide chain. This premature termination of translation prevents the synthesis of the full-length GADD45G protein.\n\nTherefore, the reason for the failure to overexpress the protein is that the ribosome's translation process was terminated too early due to an unintended stop codon in the sequence.\n\n*   **A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** This is incorrect. The primary problem is that the full protein is not being synthesized, not that it's being degraded after synthesis.\n*   **B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** This is incorrect. The DNA sequence for the HA tag correctly codes for the intended amino acid sequence.\n*   **C) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is correct. A premature `TGA` stop codon is present immediately after the HA tag sequence.\n*   **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the stop codon in the sequence is `TGA`, not `TAA`. Second, stop codons are not recognized by tRNAs; they are recognized by protein release factors that terminate translation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
