    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻) in the solution, we can follow a two-step process involving the equilibria of the phosphate buffer system.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components, H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. Then, we determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] using the second dissociation constant (Ka₂) of phosphoric acid. Finally, we use the [H⁺] and the third dissociation constant (Ka₃) to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Moles and Initial Concentrations**\n\n*   **Volume of the solution:** 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄:**\n    *   Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   This provides 0.007348 mol of the acidic component, H₂PO₄⁻.\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:**\n    *   Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   This provides 0.005618 mol of the basic component, HPO₄²⁻.\n*   **Initial Concentrations:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**\n\nThe primary equilibrium in this buffer solution involves the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, which is governed by Ka₂.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   **Ka₂ expression:** Ka₂ = ([H⁺][HPO₄²⁻]) / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n\n*   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n*   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n*   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion [PO₄³⁻] Concentration**\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed in the third dissociation step, which is governed by Ka₃.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   **Ka₃ expression:** Ka₃ = ([H⁺][PO₄³⁻]) / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe rearrange this expression to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻]:\n\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n*   We use the calculated equilibrium concentration of H⁺ and the initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻, as its consumption in this step is negligible due to the very small value of Ka₃.\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n*   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
