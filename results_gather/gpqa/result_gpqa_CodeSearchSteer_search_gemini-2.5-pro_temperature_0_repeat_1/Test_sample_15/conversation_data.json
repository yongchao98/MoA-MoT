    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and not a meso compound. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is most often due to the presence of one or more stereocenters. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The carbons of the double bond are not chiral centers. There are no other atoms with four different substituents, so there are no chiral centers. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS), which indicate the presence of specific configurations at chiral centers. The naming of a single, specific stereoisomer implies that it is a chiral molecule. As it is not a meso compound, it is optically active.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a plane of symmetry between these two carbons, making the molecule achiral. This is a classic example of a meso compound, which is optically inactive despite having chiral centers.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. The (2R,3R) configuration does not have a plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at carbon 1, which is a chiral center. Carbon 1 is bonded to a hydroxyl group, a hydrogen atom, a -CH=CH- group within the ring, and a -CH2-CH2- group within the ring. Since these four groups are different, the carbon is a chiral center. The naming of a specific enantiomer means it is optically active.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This notation indicates that the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all cis). This molecule possesses a C3 axis of symmetry and three planes of symmetry, each passing through a carbon with a hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** In this ketone, the carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and a -CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl group. Since it is bonded to two identical groups (methyl), it is not a chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral, making it optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
