    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can use the formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq):\n\nT_eq = T_eff_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_eff_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Since the star's properties (T_eff_star, R_star) are the same for both planets and it is assumed they have the same albedo (A), these terms will cancel out in the ratio:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes. Our next step is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2/a1.\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method provides the necessary information. The maximum radial velocity of the star (the semi-amplitude, K) induced by an orbiting planet is related to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) by the formula:\n\nK = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\n\nWhere 'c' is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line. The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes for the two planets is therefore:\n\nK1 / K2 = (c * Δλ₁ / λ₀) / (c * Δλ₂ / λ₀) = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\nK1 / K2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem), the star's RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nHere, M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, G is the gravitational constant, and 'a' is the semi-major axis. This formula assumes the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's and that the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on (inclination i ≈ 90°), which is a reasonable assumption since the planets were also detected by the transit method.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis 'a':\n\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a2 / a1. The terms for G and M_star will cancel out:\n\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2²) / (K2² * M_star)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (K1² * M_star)]\na2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) * (K1² / M_p1²)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   K1 / K2 = 3/4\n\nPlugging these values into the equation for a2 / a1:\n\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, we can calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
