    "When a particle with a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes the magnetic moment to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the particle's spin is aligned along the +Z direction. When the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the spin begins to precess around the new axis of the magnetic field (+Y). The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment μ in a magnetic field B is given by H = -μ ⋅ B. Since the magnetic moment μ is related to the spin S by μ = γS (where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio), the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γ(S ⋅ B).\n\nWith the magnetic field B applied along the +Y direction (B = Bŷ), the Hamiltonian is H = -γB * S<sub>y</sub>.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of an operator, such as the z-component of the spin (S<sub>z</sub>), is described by the Heisenberg equation of motion:\nd⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[S<sub>z</sub>, H]⟩\n\nSubstituting the Hamiltonian, we get:\nd⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[S<sub>z</sub>, -γBS<sub>y</sub>]⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨[S<sub>z</sub>, S<sub>y</sub>]⟩\n\nUsing the commutation relation for spin operators, [S<sub>y</sub>, S<sub>z</sub>] = iħS<sub>x</sub>, it follows that [S<sub>z</sub>, S<sub>y</sub>] = -iħS<sub>x</sub>.\nSubstituting this into the equation gives:\nd⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩/dt = (-γB/iħ)(-iħ⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩) = γB⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩\n\nTo find the oscillation, we need a second-order differential equation. We can find the time derivative of ⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩:\nd⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[S<sub>x</sub>, H]⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨[S<sub>x</sub>, S<sub>y</sub>]⟩\n\nUsing the commutation relation [S<sub>x</sub>, S<sub>y</sub>] = iħS<sub>z</sub>, we get:\nd⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩/dt = (-γB/iħ)(iħ⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩) = -γB⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩\n\nNow, by taking the time derivative of the equation for d⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩/dt and substituting the expression for d⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩/dt, we obtain:\nd²⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩/dt² = γB(d⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩/dt) = γB(-γB⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩) = -(γB)²⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, d²x/dt² = -ω²x, where the angular frequency of oscillation ω is γB. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nTherefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with a frequency of γB.\n\n<<<A>>>"
