    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a separation of charge along an axis (like a spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis), can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, provided its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation.\n\n1.  **Angular Distribution of Radiated Power:** For an oscillating electric dipole aligned with the z-axis, the power radiated per unit solid angle (*dP/dΩ*) in the radiation zone is given by the formula:\n    *   *dP/dΩ* ∝ sin²(θ)\n    where θ is the angle with respect to the axis of oscillation (the z-axis). The function *f* in the question represents this quantity.\n\n2.  **Maximum Power (A):** The radiated power is maximum when sin²(θ) is maximum. The maximum value of sin²(θ) is 1, which occurs at θ = 90° (perpendicular to the axis of oscillation). Therefore, the maximum power, A, is proportional to 1.\n    *   A ∝ sin²(90°) = 1\n\n3.  **Fraction of Power at θ = 30°:** To find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of 30°, we calculate the value of sin²(30°).\n    *   sin(30°) = 1/2\n    *   sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4\n    The power radiated at 30° is proportional to 1/4. The fraction of the maximum power A is therefore (1/4) / 1 = 1/4.\n\n4.  **Wavelength (λ) Dependence:** The power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴). The relationship between angular frequency and wavelength (λ) is:\n    *   ω = 2πc / λ\n    Therefore, the radiated power is proportional to (1/λ)⁴, or λ⁻⁴. This means the possible form of the function *f* includes a λ⁻⁴ term.\n\nCombining these results, the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at θ = 30° is 1/4, and a possible form of the function *f* is proportional to λ⁻⁴.\n\n<<<D>>>"
