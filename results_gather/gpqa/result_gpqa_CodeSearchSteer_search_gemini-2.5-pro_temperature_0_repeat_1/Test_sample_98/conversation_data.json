    "The provided information is sufficient to identify the unknown compound. A step-by-step analysis of the spectral data leads to a single logical conclusion.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, which all four possible compounds possess.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The absence of signals for vinyl-hydrogens confirms that there are no carbon-carbon double bonds in the molecule, which is consistent with all four options.\n    *   The key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described. These patterns arise when a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This pattern means a single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons: one adjacent proton (causing the doublet), a set of two adjacent protons (causing the triplet), and a set of three adjacent protons (causing the quartet).\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern indicates a single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons: one adjacent proton (causing the doublet), a set of two adjacent protons (causing the first triplet), and another, different set of two adjacent protons (causing the second triplet).\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Structures\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each proposed structure to see which one matches the observed NMR data. The names used below are the systematic IUPAC names for the structures given.\n\n*   **A) 3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid (`CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH`)**\n    *   The proton on the third carbon (C3) is adjacent to a CH₂ group (2 protons), a CH group (1 proton), and a CH₃ group (3 protons). This proton would indeed show a **doublet of triplets of quartets**.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to one proton, a set of two protons, and another set of two protons. Therefore, it cannot produce a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n*   **B) 3,4-Diethylpentanoic acid (`CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`)**\n    *   Let's examine the proton on the fourth carbon (C4). It is adjacent to a CH₃ group (3 protons), a CH group (1 proton), and the CH₂ of an ethyl group (2 protons). This proton would exhibit a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   Now, let's examine the proton on the third carbon (C3). It is adjacent to the main chain CH₂ group (2 protons), the CH group at C4 (1 proton), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2 protons). This proton would show a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   This structure is the only one that contains protons in the correct environments to produce both of the complex splitting patterns observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **C) 2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid (`CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH`)**\n    *   The proton on the third carbon (C3) is adjacent to a CH₂ group (2 protons), a CH group (1 proton), and a CH₃ group (3 protons). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets**.\n    *   Similar to structure A, there is no proton environment that would lead to a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n*   **D) 2,3-Diethylpentanoic acid (`CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH`)**\n    *   The proton on the third carbon (C3) is adjacent to the main chain CH₂ group (2 protons), the CH group at C2 (1 proton), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2 protons). This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets**.\n    *   However, this molecule lacks a proton environment that would create a doublet of triplets of quartets.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, only structure B can account for both the doublet of triplets of quartets and the doublet of triplets of triplets signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
