    "To achieve a high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, the sequence of reactions must correctly place the three substituents—acetyl, bromo, and nitro—in a 1,3,5-relationship on the benzene ring. This requires careful consideration of the directing effects of each group.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Substituent Effects**:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br)**: This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2)**: This is a strong deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of Synthetic Routes**: The goal is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene. This substitution pattern is achieved when *meta*-directing groups are used to guide subsequent additions.\n\n    *   **Starting with Bromination or Nitration**: If the first step were bromination (as in option C), the bromo group would direct the next substituent to the *ortho* and *para* positions, which is incorrect for the desired 1,3,5-pattern. If the first step were nitration (as in options A and B), the nitro group would correctly direct the next substituent to the *meta* position. However, a major limitation of the Friedel-Crafts acylation is that it fails on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene. Therefore, adding the acetyl group after nitration is not feasible.\n\n    *   **Starting with Friedel-Crafts Acylation (Option D)**: This is the most logical first step.\n        *   **Step i) CH3COCl/AlCl3**: Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n        *   **Step ii) Br2/FeBr3**: The acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position. This reaction yields 3-bromoacetophenone, correctly establishing the 1,3-relationship.\n        *   **Step iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: The final step is the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. Now, the ring has two directing groups: the *meta*-directing acetyl group and the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group. The acetyl group directs the new nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. The only position where their directing effects align is position 5 (*meta* to the acetyl group and *ortho* to the bromo group). This synergistic effect leads to the high-yield synthesis of the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe subsequent steps listed in option D (iv through vii) are unnecessary for creating the final product and appear to be erroneous. However, the initial three steps of option D represent the only chemically sound and high-yield pathway to the desired compound among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
