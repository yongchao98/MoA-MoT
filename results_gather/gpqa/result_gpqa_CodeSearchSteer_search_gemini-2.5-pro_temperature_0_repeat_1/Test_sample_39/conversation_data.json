    "In a synthetic organic chemistry lab, the phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common way to describe the results of a failed separation technique, most notably chromatography. This situation arises when the individual compounds in a mixture are not adequately separated and instead overlap significantly.\n\nThe most frequent application of this expression is in the context of thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography. In these techniques, a mixture is applied to a stationary phase, typically silica gel or alumina, and a mobile phase (a solvent) is used to move the compounds. The separation of the compounds is based on their differential partitioning between the stationary and mobile phases, which is primarily governed by their polarity.\n\nCompounds with different polarities will travel at different rates, resulting in distinct spots on a TLC plate or separate fractions from a column. However, if the compounds in the mixture have very similar polarities, they will interact with the stationary and mobile phases in a nearly identical manner. This causes them to move at almost the same speed, leading to poor separation where the spots or bands of the different compounds overlap, appearing as if they are \"on top of each other.\"\n\nWhile other factors can influence separation, polarity is the predominant property in this context.\n*   **Similar boiling points (A)** are relevant for separation by distillation, not chromatography.\n*   **Similar optical rotations (B)** are a characteristic of chiral compounds and do not directly affect separation on a standard silica or alumina column.\n*   **Non-covalent/van der Waals interactions (C)** are indeed the forces at play during chromatography, but the overall effect of these interactions is summarized by the compound's polarity. The similarity of these interactions for different compounds is due to their similar polarities.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and common reason for compounds to be \"on top of each other\" in a chromatographic separation is that they possess similar polarities.\n\n<<<D>>>"
