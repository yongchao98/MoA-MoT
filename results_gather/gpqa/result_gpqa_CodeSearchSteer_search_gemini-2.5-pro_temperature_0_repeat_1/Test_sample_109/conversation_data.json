    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must first calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and then compare it to the limiting magnitudes of the instruments. A star is observable by both if its apparent magnitude is brighter than the limit of both instruments.\n\nThe observational limits are:\n*   **ESPRESSO:** Apparent V magnitude < 17 mag\n*   **HIRES:** Apparent V magnitude < 16 mag\n\nFor a star to be seen by both, it must satisfy the stricter condition, which is an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16.\n\nThe relationship between apparent magnitude (m), absolute magnitude (M), distance in parsecs (d), and extinction (A_V) is given by the formula: m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V. Extinction (A_V) is related to the color excess E(B-V) by A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V), as specified in the problem.\n\nHere is the analysis for each star:\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   Absolute V magnitude (M_V) = 15.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n    *   There is no mention of extinction, so A_V = 0.\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (m_V) = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 = 15.5 mag.\n    *   Since 15.5 is brighter than 16, Star 1 is detectable by both instruments.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (m_V) = 16.5 mag\n    *   This value is given directly.\n    *   Since 16.5 is fainter than 16, Star 2 cannot be detected by HIRES.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (m_V) = 15.5 mag\n    *   The apparent magnitude is stated directly. The additional information about color excess and distance does not alter this given value.\n    *   Since 15.5 is brighter than 16, Star 3 is detectable by both instruments.\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   Absolute V magnitude (M_V) = 15.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n    *   Color excess E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n    *   First, calculate the extinction: A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   Now, calculate the apparent magnitude: m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n    *   Since 16.74 is fainter than 16, Star 4 cannot be detected by HIRES.\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   Absolute V magnitude (M_V) = 16.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n    *   There is no mention of extinction, so A_V = 0.\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (m_V) = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 â‰ˆ 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag.\n    *   Since 14.995 is brighter than 16, Star 5 is detectable by both instruments.\n\nBased on these calculations, Star 1, Star 3, and Star 5 are all bright enough to be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. Reviewing the given options, the pair that consists of two detectable stars is Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<C>>>"
