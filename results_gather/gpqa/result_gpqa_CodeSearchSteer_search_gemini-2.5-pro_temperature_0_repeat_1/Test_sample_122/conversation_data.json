    "The search results confirm the formulas used.\n\n*   **Time Dilation Formula:** `t = t₀ / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, which is the same as `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n*   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The exact value is 299,792.458 km/s. However, using the approximation 300,000 km/s is common in such problems and, as shown by the calculation, leads to an answer extremely close to one of the options.\n\nThe problem is a straightforward application of these principles.\n\n**Summary of Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Galaxy Frame (S): The \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   Ejecta Frame (S'): The \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Proper time (time in ejecta's frame), `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   Speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Goal:**\n    *   Find the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's frame (S).\n\n4.  **Steps:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy frame is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame.\n    *   Calculate the time `Δt` in the Galaxy frame using the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n        *   `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`.\n        *   `v²/c² = 0.04`.\n        *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`.\n    *   Now, calculate `Δt`:\n        *   `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`.\n    *   Finally, calculate the distance `d`:\n        *   `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s`.\n        *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`.\n        *   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n    *   Comparing this to the given options, option D (3,060,000 km) is the closest match. The minor difference is attributable to rounding in the problem's options.\n\nThe reasoning is sound, the formulas are correct, and the calculation is verified. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S) is the stationary frame.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S') is the moving frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the proper time.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (`d`).\n\n4.  **Apply the relevant formulas:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is given by `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, the time elapsed in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt₀`) by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   The term `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`:\n        `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   Finally, calculate the distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   Calculating the value:\n        `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with the options:**\n    *   The calculated value of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to option D. The slight difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\nIf we assume option D is the exact intended answer, it implies a dilated time `Δt = 3,060,000 km / 60,000 km/s = 51 s`. This is consistent with the time dilation effect, as 51 seconds in the Galaxy frame corresponds to 50 seconds in the faster-moving ejecta frame.\n\n<<<D>>>"
