    "To determine the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx, we first need to calculate the individual expectation values of σz and σx for the given spin state. The state of the spin-half particle is a linear superposition given by |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩.\n\nThe expectation value of an operator A is calculated as ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩. The calculation is performed as follows:\n\n### 1. Expectation Value of σz\n\nThe σz operator has the eigenstates |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ with corresponding eigenvalues +1 and -1.\n\n*   First, we apply the σz operator to the state |ψ⟩:\n    σz|ψ⟩ = σz(0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩) = 0.5(σz|↑⟩) + (√3)/2(σz|↓⟩) = 0.5(+1)|↑⟩ + (√3)/2(-1)|↓⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ - (√3)/2|↓⟩.\n\n*   Next, we calculate the inner product ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩:\n    ⟨σz⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * (0.5|↑⟩ - (√3)/2|↓⟩)\n    Using the relations ⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1, ⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1, and ⟨↑|↓⟩ = ⟨↓|↑⟩ = 0, we get:\n    ⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)(0.5) - (√3/2)(√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.\n\n### 2. Expectation Value of σx\n\nThe σx operator acts on the basis states as σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩.\n\n*   First, we apply the σx operator to the state |ψ⟩:\n    σx|ψ⟩ = σx(0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩) = 0.5(σx|↑⟩) + (√3)/2(σx|↓⟩) = 0.5|↓⟩ + (√3)/2|↑⟩.\n\n*   Next, we calculate the inner product ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩:\n    ⟨σx⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * ((√3)/2|↑⟩ + 0.5|↓⟩)\n    ⟨σx⟩ = (0.5)(√3/2)⟨↑|↑⟩ + (0.5)(0.5)⟨↑|↓⟩ + (√3/2)(√3/2)⟨↓|↑⟩ + (√3/2)(0.5)⟨↓|↓⟩\n    ⟨σx⟩ = √3/4 + 0 + 0 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2.\n\n### 3. Expectation Value of the Combined Operator\n\nNow, we use the linearity of expectation values to find the expectation value of the full operator O = 10σz + 5σx:\n\n*   ⟨O⟩ = ⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩.\n*   Substituting the calculated values:\n    ⟨O⟩ = 10(-0.5) + 5(√3/2) = -5 + 2.5 * √3.\n*   Using the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n    ⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732 = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.\n\nRounding the result to one decimal place, we get -0.7.\n\n<<<C>>>"
