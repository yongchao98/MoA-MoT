    "To determine the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition of the wave function. According to the Born interpretation, the square of the modulus of the wave function, |ψ(x)|², gives the probability density of finding the particle at a certain position x. Since the particle must exist somewhere, the integral of this probability density over all possible space must be equal to 1.\n\nThe given wave function is:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe probability density is the square of the magnitude of the wave function:\n|ψ(x)|² = [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]²\n|ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + [-0.5]²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nWe are told that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, we must integrate the probability density function from x=1 to x=3 and set the result to 1.\n\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫¹³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\nFirst, we solve the first integral:\na² ∫¹³ (1 / (1 + x)) dx = a² [ln(1 + x)]¹³\n= a² (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1))\n= a² (ln(4) - ln(2))\n= a² ln(4/2)\n= a² ln(2)\n\nNext, we solve the second integral:\n∫¹³ 0.25 dx = 0.25 [x]¹³\n= 0.25 (3 - 1)\n= 0.25 * 2\n= 0.5\n\nNow, we substitute these results back into the normalization equation:\na² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nSolving for \"a\":\na² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value of ln(2) ≈ 0.6931, we can calculate \"a\":\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.8493\n\nThis value is approximately 0.85.\n\n<<<B>>>"
