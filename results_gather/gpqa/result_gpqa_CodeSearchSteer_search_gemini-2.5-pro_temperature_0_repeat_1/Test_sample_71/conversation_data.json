    "The multi-step synthesis can be analyzed as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a dienophile with two reactive double bonds. It reacts with a diene generated from 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. While the name of the diene precursor is unusual and not found in standard databases, its structure strongly suggests it is a precursor to an *o*-quinodimethane. This reactive diene would undergo a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition with both double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative. This results in Product 1, a large polycyclic molecule with a central 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core fused to two other ring systems.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. This is a standard method for the acidic cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group at the 7-position is converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming the corresponding alcohol, Product 2.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. This set of reagents corresponds to the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing secondary alcohols to ketones. The secondary alcohol at the 7-position is oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O), yielding the ketone, Product 3.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\nProduct 3 is heated to 150°C. This temperature is sufficient to induce a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. The reaction is the reverse of the initial cycloaddition. This thermal decomposition will break down Product 3 into its constituent parts, or more stable versions thereof:\n*   The diene units are released as two molecules of *o*-quinodimethane, which rapidly tautomerize to the stable aromatic compound, *o*-xylene.\n*   The central core is released as bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one. This molecule is known to be thermally unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic reaction, extruding a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the highly stable aromatic product, benzene.\n\nTherefore, the final organic products, collectively referred to as \"product 4,\" are a mixture of *o*-xylene and benzene.\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4, we must count the number of unique proton environments in the mixture of benzene and *o*-xylene.\n*   **Benzene (C₆H₆):** Due to its high symmetry, all six hydrogen atoms are chemically equivalent. This accounts for **1** type of hydrogen atom.\n*   ***o*-Xylene (1,2-dimethylbenzene):** This molecule has a C₂ᵥ symmetry axis.\n    *   The six hydrogens on the two equivalent methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. This is **1** type.\n    *   The two aromatic hydrogens at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent to each other. This is a **second** type.\n    *   The two aromatic hydrogens at positions 4 and 5 are equivalent to each other. This is a **third** type.\n    In total, *o*-xylene has **3** types of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product mixture is the sum of the types from each component: 1 (from benzene) + 3 (from *o*-xylene) = **4**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
