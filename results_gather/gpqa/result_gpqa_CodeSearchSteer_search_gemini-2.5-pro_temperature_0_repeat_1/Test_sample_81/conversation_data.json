    "Here's a breakdown of the reaction sequence and the stereochemistry at each step:\n\n**Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene + Maleic Anhydride → Product 1**\n\n*   This is a Diels-Alder reaction where cyclooctatetraene acts as a diene and maleic anhydride is the dienophile.\n*   Maleic anhydride is a *cis*-dienophile, meaning the stereochemistry of the dienophile is retained in the product.\n*   The reaction results in a *syn* addition, forming a bicyclic adduct where the anhydride ring is *cis*-fused to the newly formed six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + Methanol/H₂SO₄ → Product 2**\n\n*   This reaction is a Fischer esterification. The cyclic anhydride (Product 1) is heated with methanol in the presence of an acid catalyst (sulfuric acid).\n*   The anhydride ring opens and is converted into two methyl ester groups.\n*   Because the original anhydride was *cis*, the two resulting methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) groups will also be in a *cis* relationship to each other.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + Cyclopentadiene → Product 3**\n\n*   This is a second Diels-Alder reaction. Product 2, which contains a double bond, now acts as the dienophile, and cyclopentadiene is the diene.\n*   In Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes like cyclopentadiene, the major product is typically the *endo* isomer. This is due to favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the two ester groups in this case) are positioned \"under\" the diene.\n*   The cyclopentadiene will add to the double bond of Product 2 from the face opposite to the bulky ester groups to minimize steric hindrance. This is an *anti*-addition relative to the ester groups.\n*   The combination of the *endo* rule and the *anti*-addition determines the final stereochemistry of Product 3. The bridge from the cyclopentadiene will be on the opposite side of the molecule from the two ester groups.\n\nBased on this analysis, the major isomer of product 3 will have the following stereochemical features:\n1.  The two methoxycarbonyl groups are *cis* to each other.\n2.  The cyclopentadiene adds in an *endo* fashion.\n3.  The cyclopentadiene adds to the face of the dienophile opposite the ester groups (*anti*-addition).\n\nEvaluating the given options:\n\n*   **A) name: dimethyl (1R,4S,4aR,4bR,5R,8S,8aS,8bS,10S,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This structure corresponds to the *exo* adduct, where the cyclopentadiene has added to the same side as the ester groups. This is sterically hindered and not the major product.\n\n*   **B) name: dimethyl (1R,4S,4aS,4bR,5S,8R,8aS,8bR,10S,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This structure has the two methoxycarbonyl groups in a *trans* configuration, which would not be formed from the *cis*-anhydride starting material.\n\n*   **C) name: dimethyl (1S,4R,4aR,4bR,5S,8R,8aS,8bS,10S,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This structure represents the *endo* adduct resulting from the *anti*-addition of cyclopentadiene. The methoxycarbonyl groups are *cis*, and the cyclopentadiene bridge is on the opposite face. This is the expected major product.\n\n*   **D) name: dimethyl (1R,4S,4aS,4bR,5R,8S,8aS,8bR,10R,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This structure also has the methoxycarbonyl groups in a *trans* configuration.\n\nTherefore, the structure of the major isomer of product 3 is correctly represented by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
