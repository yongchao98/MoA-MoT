    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the non-Gaussianity (nG) for the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n**1. Understand the Definition of Non-Gaussianity**\n\nThe problem defines the non-Gaussianity measure, `del_b`, as the difference between the entropy of the reference Gaussian state (`tau`) and the entropy of the non-Gaussian state (`rho`):\n`del_b = trace(rho * ln(rho)) - trace(tau * ln(tau))`\n\nThis can be rewritten using the definition of von Neumann entropy, `S(x) = -trace(x * ln(x))`, as:\n`del_b = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n**2. Calculate the Entropy of the State `rho`**\n\nThe state `|psi>` is a pure quantum state. The corresponding density matrix `rho = |psi><psi|` represents a pure state. The von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero.\nTherefore, `S(rho) = 0`.\n\nThis simplifies the non-Gaussianity to be just the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\n`del_b = S(tau)`\n\n**3. Identify the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\n\nThe reference Gaussian state `tau` is defined as the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments (mean displacement and covariance matrix) as the state `rho`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Moments of the State `rho`**\n\nFirst, we specify the state for the given parameters `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\nThe state becomes an \"odd cat state\":\n`|psi> ∝ (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`\n\nThe first and second moments are calculated as the expectation values of the annihilation (`a`) and creation (`a^†`) operators.\n\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):** The mean amplitude `< a >` is calculated to be 0 for an odd cat state. This means the reference Gaussian state is centered at the origin of the phase space.\n\n*   **Second Moments:** We need the mean photon number `n = <a^†a>` and the squeezing parameter `m = <a^2>`. The calculations for the odd cat state yield:\n    *   `m = alpha^2`\n    *   `n = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n\nPlugging in `alpha = 0.5` (`alpha^2 = 0.25`):\n*   `m = 0.25`\n*   `n = 0.25 * coth(0.25) ≈ 0.25 * 4.0831 ≈ 1.0208`\n\n**5. Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State `tau`**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode centered Gaussian state is determined by its single symplectic eigenvalue, `nu`. The relationship between `nu` and the moments `n` and `m` is:\n`nu = sqrt((n + 1/2)^2 - |m|^2)`\n\nPlugging in the calculated values for `n` and `m`:\n*   `nu = sqrt((1.0208 + 0.5)^2 - 0.25^2)`\n*   `nu = sqrt(1.5208^2 - 0.0625) = sqrt(2.3128 - 0.0625) = sqrt(2.2503)`\n*   `nu ≈ 1.5001`\n\nThe value of `nu` is extremely close to 1.5.\n\nThe von Neumann entropy `S(tau)` is given by the formula:\n`S(tau) = (nu + 1/2) * ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2) * ln(nu - 1/2)`\n\nUsing `nu = 1.5`:\n*   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n*   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n*   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 0`\n*   `S(tau) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`\n\n**6. Final Result**\n\nThe non-Gaussianity `del_b` is equal to `S(tau)`.\n`del_b ≈ 1.3862`\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
