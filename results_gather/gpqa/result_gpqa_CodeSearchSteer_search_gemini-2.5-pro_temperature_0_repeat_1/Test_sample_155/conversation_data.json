    "The analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting products is correct.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** The treatment of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) with mCPBA results in a syn-addition to form a meso-epoxide. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening is an anti-addition, which leads to the formation of a racemic mixture of (4R, 5R)- and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two products are enantiomers.\n*   **Reaction 2:** The treatment of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA results in a syn-addition to form a racemic mixture of cis-epoxides. The subsequent acid-catalyzed anti-addition of water to this racemic mixture results in the formation of a single product: the meso compound, (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nThe final mixture, therefore, contains three stereoisomers: the (4R, 5R) enantiomer, the (4S, 5S) enantiomer, and the (4R, 5S) meso compound.\n\nThe chromatographic separation of this mixture is as follows:\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This method separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated; they will elute together as a single peak. Diastereomers, such as the enantiomeric pair and the meso compound, have different physical properties and can be separated. Thus, the racemic mixture of (4R, 5R)- and (4S, 5S)-diols will appear as one peak, and the meso-diol will appear as a second, separate peak. This results in a total of **2 peaks**.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase to separate enantiomers. The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. Therefore, the (4R, 5R)-diol and the (4S, 5S)-diol will be resolved into two separate peaks. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and appear as its own peak. This results in a total of **3 peaks**.\n\nTherefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>"
