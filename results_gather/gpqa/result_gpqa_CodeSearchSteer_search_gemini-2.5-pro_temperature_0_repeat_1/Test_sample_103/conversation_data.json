    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The gravitational pull of an orbiting planet causes the star to \"wobble\" around the common center of mass. This wobble induces a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along the line of sight, according to the Doppler effect formula:\n    Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c\n    Where λ₀ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n    This means the amplitude of the radial velocity variation, denoted as K, is directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of Radial Velocity Amplitudes:**\n    We are given:\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n4.  **Use the Formula for Radial Velocity Amplitude:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * [m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)]\n    Where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   m_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio for the Two Systems:** We can write the ratio K₂ / K₁ using the formula above:\n    K₂ / K₁ = { (2πG / P₂)^(1/3) * [m_p2 * sin(i₂) / M_star2^(2/3)] } / { (2πG / P₁)^(1/3) * [m_p1 * sin(i₁) / M_star1^(2/3)] }\n\n    This simplifies to:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3) * (m_p2 / m_p1) * (sin(i₂) / sin(i₁)) * (M_star1 / M_star2)^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Apply the Given Conditions:** The problem states:\n    *   The stars have exactly the same masses: M_star1 = M_star2.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: m_p1 ≈ m_p2.\n    *   Since the orbital inclinations (i) are not given, we make the reasonable assumption that they are similar for this comparison, so sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂).\n\n    Applying these conditions, the terms for mass and inclination cancel out:\n    *   (m_p2 / m_p1) ≈ 1\n    *   (sin(i₂) / sin(i₁)) ≈ 1\n    *   (M_star1 / M_star2)^(2/3) = 1\n\n    The equation simplifies significantly to:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods (P₂ / P₁):**\n    We substitute the known value of K₂ / K₁:\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for the period ratio, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We find this by taking the reciprocal:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.40\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
