    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star\\_1 (L₁) to that of Star\\_2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    Simplifying this gives:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂) * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star\\_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star\\_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n    Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**: To find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates a star's temperature to the peak wavelength (λ_emitted) of its emitted light:\n    T = b / λ_emitted\n    where b is Wien's constant.\n    This means the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁ / T₂ = (b / λ_emitted₁) / (b / λ_emitted₂) = λ_emitted₂ / λ_emitted₁\n\n5.  **Doppler Shift**: The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths (λ_observed) are the same for both stars. The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity (v) due to the Doppler effect:\n    λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c)\n    where c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).\n\n6.  **Relating Emitted Wavelengths**:\n    *   For Star\\_1, v₁ = 0 km/s, so λ_observed₁ = λ_emitted₁.\n    *   For Star\\_2, v₂ = 700 km/s, so λ_observed₂ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_observed₁ = λ_observed₂, we have:\n        λ_emitted₁ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 700/300000)\n\n7.  **Calculating Temperature Ratio**: Now we can substitute this relationship back into our temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n    T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted₂ / [λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 700/300000)]\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + 700/300000)\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1.002333...)\n\n8.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation from step 2:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1.002333...)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00936\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information regarding the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star\\_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star\\_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>"
