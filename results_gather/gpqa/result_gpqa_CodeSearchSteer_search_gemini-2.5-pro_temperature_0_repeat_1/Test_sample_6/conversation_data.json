    "To determine the energy at which the lifetime of high-energy Î³-rays is limited by pair production with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, we need to calculate the threshold energy for this interaction. The process is $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$, where a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) collides with a CMB photon ($\\gamma$) to create an electron ($e^{-}$) and a positron ($e^{+}$).\n\nThe threshold energy for this reaction is determined by the principle of conservation of energy and momentum. For pair production to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two photons must be at least the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. The condition for the threshold energy ($E_\\gamma$) of the high-energy photon interacting with a CMB photon ($E_{CMB}$) is given by the formula:\n\n$E_\\gamma E_{CMB} \\ge (m_e c^2)^2$\n\nwhere:\n*   $E_\\gamma$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n*   $E_{CMB}$ is the average energy of a CMB photon, given as $10^{-3}$ eV.\n*   $m_e c^2$ is the rest mass energy of an electron.\n\nFrom experimental values, the rest mass energy of an electron is approximately 0.511 MeV.\n\nFirst, we convert the electron's rest mass energy to eV:\n$m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV} = 5.11 \\times 10^5 \\text{ eV}$\n\nNext, we can calculate the threshold energy for the gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$) by rearranging the threshold condition formula:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nNow, we substitute the known values into the equation:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(5.11 \\times 10^5 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{2.611 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question provides the options in units of GeV, so we need to convert our result from eV to GeV:\n\n$1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis result, approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV, corresponds to the minimum energy a gamma-ray must have to undergo pair production with a CMB photon. Above this energy, the probability of this interaction increases, thus limiting the distance these gamma-rays can travel through the universe.\n\nComparing our calculated value with the given options:\nA) 2.6*1e5 GeV\nB) 9.5*1e4 GeV\nC) 1.8*1e5 GeV\nD) 3.9*1e5 GeV\n\nThe calculated energy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
