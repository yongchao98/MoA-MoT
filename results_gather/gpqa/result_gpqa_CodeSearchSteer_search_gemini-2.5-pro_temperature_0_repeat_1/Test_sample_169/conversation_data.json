    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨S_y⟩, for an electron in the spin state (3i, 4), we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Normalize the spin state vector.**\n    The given unnormalized spin state is |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4). In vector notation, this is:\n    ```\n    |ψ⟩ = [ 3i ]\n          [ 4  ]\n    ```\n    The corresponding bra vector is ⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4].\n    To normalize the state, we first calculate the inner product ⟨ψ|ψ⟩:\n    ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n    The normalization constant is the reciprocal of the square root of this value, which is 1/√25 = 1/5.\n    The normalized state vector |ψ_norm⟩ is:\n    ```\n    |ψ_norm⟩ = (1/5) * [ 3i ]\n                       [ 4  ]\n    ```\n\n2.  **Define the spin operator S_y.**\n    The spin operator S_y is defined in terms of the Pauli matrix σ_y and the reduced Planck constant ħ:\n    S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y\n    Given the matrix for σ_y:\n    ```\n    σ_y = [ 0  -i ]\n          [ i   0 ]\n    ```\n    The S_y operator is:\n    ```\n    S_y = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ]\n                 [ i   0 ]\n    ```\n\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩.**\n    The expectation value is calculated as ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ_norm| S_y |ψ_norm⟩.\n    We can also calculate it using the unnormalized state and dividing by the norm squared: ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.\n\n    Let's first compute the action of S_y on the unnormalized state |ψ⟩:\n    ```\n    S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ]\n                     [ i   0 ]   [ 4  ]\n    \n           = (ħ/2) * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ]\n                     [ (i)(3i) + (0)(4)  ]\n    \n           = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]\n                     [ 3i² ]\n    \n           = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]\n                     [ -3  ]\n    ```\n    Now, we compute the inner product ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩:\n    ```\n    ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]\n                                   [ -3  ]\n    \n              = (ħ/2) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n    \n              = (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12]\n    \n              = (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12]\n    \n              = (ħ/2) * [-24]\n    \n              = -12ħ\n    ```\n    Finally, we divide by the normalization factor ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 25:\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = -12ħ / 25.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) -25*hbar/2\nB) 25*hbar/2\nC) 12*hbar/25\nD) -12*hbar/25\n\nThe calculated expectation value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
