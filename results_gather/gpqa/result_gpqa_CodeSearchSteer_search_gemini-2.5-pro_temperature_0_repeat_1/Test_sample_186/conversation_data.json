    "An analysis of the six listed celestial objects reveals that three would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph under the specified conditions. A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 can be achieved in a one-hour exposure using a single 8m VLT telescope.\n\nAccording to performance documentation for ESPRESSO, when coupled with one Unit Telescope (1-UT mode), it can achieve an S/N of 10 in one hour for a star with an apparent visual magnitude (V) of approximately 17.1. Therefore, any star with a V magnitude of 17.1 or brighter (i.e., a smaller magnitude value) will be detectable.\n\nHere is a case-by-case evaluation of each star:\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** As the second-brightest star in the night sky, Canopus has an apparent visual magnitude of approximately -0.74. Its declination of about -52° 42' makes it easily visible from the Paranal Observatory in Chile (latitude ~24° S). Since its magnitude is significantly brighter than the 17.1 limit, **Canopus is detectable**.\n\n*   **b) Polaris:** The North Star, Polaris, has an apparent magnitude of about 1.98. However, its declination is approximately +89° 15'. The Paranal Observatory is located in the Southern Hemisphere, and sources confirm that Polaris is too far north to be visible from ESO's telescopes in Chile. An object must be above the horizon to be observed. Therefore, **Polaris is not detectable** from Paranal.\n\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc distance with Absolute V magnitude of 15:** The apparent magnitude (V) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (Mv) and distance (d) in parsecs using the formula V = Mv - 5 + 5*log₁₀(d).\n    *   V = 15 - 5 + 5*log₁₀(10) = 10 + 5*(1) = 15.0.\n    *   Since 15.0 is brighter than 17.1, this **star is detectable**.\n\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc distance with Absolute V magnitude of 15:** Using the same formula:\n    *   V = 15 - 5 + 5*log₁₀(200) ≈ 10 + 5*(2.301) ≈ 21.5.\n    *   Since 21.5 is much fainter than 17.1, this **star is not detectable**.\n\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc distance with Absolute V magnitude of 15:**\n    *   V = 15 - 5 + 5*log₁₀(5) ≈ 10 + 5*(0.699) ≈ 13.5.\n    *   Since 13.5 is brighter than 17.1, this **star is detectable**.\n\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc distance with Absolute V magnitude of 15:**\n    *   V = 15 - 5 + 5*log₁₀(50) ≈ 10 + 5*(1.699) ≈ 18.5.\n    *   Since 18.5 is fainter than 17.1, this **star is not detectable**.\n\nIn summary, three of the listed stars are detectable: Canopus, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc.\n\n<<<A>>>"
