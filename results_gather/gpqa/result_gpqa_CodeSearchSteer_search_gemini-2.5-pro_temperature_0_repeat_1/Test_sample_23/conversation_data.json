    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\nThe problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of cycloalkanes.\n*   The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as: (mass of H) / (total mass) = (2n * 1.008) / (n * 12.011 + 2n * 1.008) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n*   1/7 ≈ 0.1428, which matches the given value of 14.28%.\nThe problem also mentions that Z is widely used as a solvent. A very common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits all the descriptions for substance Z.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Process**\n\n*   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating the components are saturated or behave as such.\n*   Substance Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only substance Z (cyclohexane).\n*   This means Y consists of cyclohexane and another liquid that, upon severe hydrogenation, also becomes cyclohexane.\n*   A plausible reaction that fits the description of a disproportionation producing two stable C6 molecules is the catalytic transfer of hydrogen to form a saturated ring and an aromatic ring. Let's hypothesize that mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   Let's check this hypothesis:\n    *   **Does it decolorize bromine water?** Cyclohexane is saturated and does not react. Benzene's aromatic ring is very stable and does not react with bromine water without a specific catalyst, so the mixture would not decolorize it. This fits.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of Y:** Hydrogenating cyclohexane (C6H12) causes no change. Hydrogenating benzene (C6H6) adds 3 molecules of H2 to form cyclohexane (C6H12). Thus, hydrogenating the mixture (cyclohexane + benzene) yields only cyclohexane (Z). This fits perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   When heated with platinum, mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both components of X must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n\nThe transformation from X to Y (cyclohexane + benzene) is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X must donate hydrogen (get oxidized to benzene), and the other must accept hydrogen (get reduced to cyclohexane).\n\nLet the two liquids in mixture X be A and B. The reaction is:\nA + B → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n\nThis is a balanced reaction if one molecule of A reacts with one molecule of B. For this to be a hydrogen transfer:\n*   One molecule (the hydrogen acceptor) must be C6H10. When it accepts two hydrogen atoms, it becomes C6H12.\n*   The other molecule (the hydrogen donor) must be C6H8. When it loses two hydrogen atoms, it becomes C6H6.\n\nSo, the components of mixture X are a C6H10 molecule and a C6H8 molecule.\n*   **C6H10**: To hydrogenate to cyclohexane, this must be **cyclohexene**. It has one double bond, is a liquid, and decolorizes bromine water.\n*   **C6H8**: To hydrogenate to cyclohexane, this must be a cyclohexadiene. The two isomers are 1,3-cyclohexadiene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. The problem states there are no *conjugated* multiple bonds, which rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Therefore, this component must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. It has two isolated double bonds, is a liquid, and decolorizes bromine water.\n\nThis proposed composition for mixture X fits all conditions. The reaction on heated platinum is a known catalytic hydrogen transfer, which is a form of disproportionation:\nC6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has **10** hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has **8** hydrogen atoms.\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>"
