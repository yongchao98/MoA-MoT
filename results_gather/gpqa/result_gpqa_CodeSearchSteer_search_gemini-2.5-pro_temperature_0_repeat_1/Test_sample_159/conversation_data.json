    "When the number of sides N of a regular polygon becomes infinitely large, the polygon approaches a circle. In this case, the aperture can be considered a circular aperture with a radius equal to the apothem 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a central bright disk surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J₁(x).\n\nThe condition for the minima in the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by:\n\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = (m * λ) / D\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the aperture (D = 2a).\n*   m is a coefficient derived from the zeros of the Bessel function.\n\nFor the first minimum, m has a value of approximately 1.220. For the second minimum, the coefficient m is approximately 2.233.\n\nThe angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is:\nθ₁ = 1.220 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is:\nθ₂ = 2.233 * λ / (2a) ≈ 1.1165 * λ / a\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima (Δθ) is the difference between θ₂ and θ₁:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ ≈ (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5065 * λ / a\n\nThis can also be calculated more precisely using the arguments of the Bessel function zeros. The minima occur when the argument ρ of the Bessel function J₁(ρ) is a zero. The first non-trivial zero is at ρ₁ ≈ 3.8317 and the second is at ρ₂ ≈ 7.0156.\n\nThe angle θ is related to ρ by:\nρ = (2πa / λ) * sin(θ)\n\nUsing the small angle approximation (sin(θ) ≈ θ):\nθ = (ρ * λ) / (2πa)\n\nSo, for the first two minima:\nθ₁ = (3.8317 * λ) / (2πa) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a\nθ₂ = (7.0156 * λ) / (2πa) ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a\n\nThe angular distance is:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ / a ≈ 0.5068 * λ / a\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1.220 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 0.506 λ / a\nD) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 0.507 λ / a is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
