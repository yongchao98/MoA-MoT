    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the effect of starspots on brightness:** The brightness of the star changes as it rotates, showing us either its unspotted hemisphere or its spotted one. The maximum brightness (F_max) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The minimum brightness (F_min) occurs when the hemisphere with a 20% spot coverage faces the observer.\n\n2.  **Apply the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The flux (F) of radiation from a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (Teff), i.e., F ∝ Teff⁴.\n    *   Star's effective temperature (Teff_star) = 6000 K\n    *   Spots' temperature (Teff_spot) = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\n3.  **Calculate the relative flux for both hemispheres:**\n    *   The flux from the unspotted hemisphere (F_max) is proportional to Teff_star⁴. So, F_max ∝ 6000⁴.\n    *   The flux from the spotted hemisphere (F_min) is a combination of the flux from the unspotted part (80% of the area) and the spotted part (20% of the area).\n        F_min ∝ (0.80 × Teff_star⁴) + (0.20 × Teff_spot⁴)\n        F_min ∝ (0.80 × 6000⁴) + (0.20 × 5000⁴)\n\n4.  **Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation:** The amplitude is the relative drop in flux when the spotted side is showing.\n    Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n    Amplitude = [6000⁴ - ((0.80 × 6000⁴) + (0.20 × 5000⁴))] / 6000⁴\n    By dividing each term by 6000⁴, we get:\n    Amplitude = 1 - 0.80 - 0.20 × (5000/6000)⁴\n    Amplitude = 0.20 - 0.20 × (5/6)⁴\n    Amplitude = 0.20 × (1 - (5/6)⁴)\n    Amplitude ≈ 0.20 × (1 - 0.4823)\n    Amplitude ≈ 0.20 × 0.5177\n    Amplitude ≈ 0.1035\n\n5.  **Relate the brightness variation to an exoplanet transit:** The drop in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet (the transit depth) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n    Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π × R_pl²) / (π × R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n6.  **Solve for the relative radius of the exoplanet (R_pl/R_star):** To produce the same amplitude signal, the transit depth must equal the amplitude from the starspots.\n    (R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude ≈ 0.1035\n    R_pl / R_star = √0.1035\n    R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3217\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<B>>>"
