    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Information**: The spectrum shows absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-). This confirms the presence of two oxygen atoms in the molecule. All four possible answers have \"O2\" in their formula, which is consistent with this finding.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**:\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**: This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents attached.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H**: A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. The presence of only two signals for these four protons suggests a symmetrical arrangement, such as a para (1,4) substitution, which would result in two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets)**: This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by one other vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups**: One methyl group is part of the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-CH₃). The second methyl group must be part of the ester functionality, indicating a methyl ester (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **No signals for –CH₂ groups**: This is a crucial constraint. It rules out substituents like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃), or allyl (-CH₂CH=CH₂).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure**: Based on the analysis, the compound consists of:\n    *   A benzene ring (C₆H₄)\n    *   A propenyl group (-C₃H₅)\n    *   A methyl ester group (-COOCH₃, which contributes C₂H₃O₂)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Chemical Formula**: Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n    *   **Carbon (C)**: 6 (from the benzene ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 1 (from the carbonyl group) + 1 (from the methyl part of the ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 (from the aromatic ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group: -CH=CH-C**H₃**) + 3 (from the methyl ester group) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 (from the ester group)\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This corresponds to a structure like methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options**:\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: Incorrect. This would likely contain a propyl group instead of a propenyl group, which would have -CH₂ signals.\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: Incorrect. A plausible structure would be ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, but this contains an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) and is thus ruled out by the absence of -CH₂ signals.\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: Incorrect. It is difficult to construct a molecule with this formula that matches all the spectral data without including -CH₂ groups or other features that contradict the NMR data.\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: Correct. This formula perfectly matches the structure deduced from the FTIR and NMR spectra.\n\n<<<D>>>"
