    "The problem describes a two-step dipole transition, also known as a cascade decay, from the |3,0,0⟩ (3s) state to the |1,0,0⟩ (1s) state of a hydrogen atom. The decay must proceed through an intermediate state, which, according to the dipole selection rules, must be a *p* state (*l*=1). The options provided suggest the intermediate state is one of the |2,1,m⟩ (2p) states.\n\n### Analysis of the Transition Route\n\n1.  **First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩**\n    *   The initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩.\n    *   According to the electric dipole selection rules, the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be Δ*l* = ±1. Since the initial state has *l*=0, the intermediate state must have *l'*=1.\n    *   The selection rule for the magnetic quantum number is Δ*m* = 0, ±1. Since the initial state has *m*=0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = 0, +1, or -1.\n    *   Therefore, the allowed intermediate states are |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n2.  **Second Transition: |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n    *   The final state is |n=1, l=0, m=0⟩.\n    *   For a transition from an intermediate state with *l'*=1, the change is Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δ*m* = 0 - *m'*, must be 0, ±1. This condition is met for all possible intermediate *m'* values (-1, 0, 1).\n    *   Thus, all three proposed pathways are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### Calculation of Probabilities\n\nThe question asks for the probability corresponding to a specific transition route. This refers to the branching ratio for that particular decay channel. The branching ratio is the fraction of decays that proceed through a specific path.\n\nLet's consider an ensemble of hydrogen atoms in the initial |3,0,0⟩ state. The first step of the decay is the transition to one of the three degenerate |2,1,m'⟩ states.\n\n*   The rate of a transition is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element.\n*   The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric.\n*   Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the first photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to be left in any of the three |2,1,m'⟩ states.\n\nThis means the transition rates from |3,0,0⟩ to each of the |2,1,m'⟩ states are equal:\nΓ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩)\n\nThe total rate of decay from the 3s state to the 2p states is the sum of these individual rates:\nΓ<sub>total</sub> = Γ(→|2,1,1⟩) + Γ(→|2,1,0⟩) + Γ(→|2,1,-1⟩)\n\nThe probability, or branching ratio, for any single path (e.g., through the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩) is the rate for that path divided by the total rate:\nP(route via |2,1,0⟩) = Γ(→|2,1,0⟩) / Γ<sub>total</sub>\n\nSince the three individual rates are equal, let's call them Γ<sub>0</sub>. Then Γ<sub>total</sub> = 3Γ<sub>0</sub>.\nP(route via |2,1,0⟩) = Γ<sub>0</sub> / (3Γ<sub>0</sub>) = 1/3.\n\nThe same logic applies to the other two routes, giving them each a probability of 1/3.\n\nOnce the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, it will decay to the |1,0,0⟩ ground state, as this is the only lower-energy state accessible via a dipole transition. The probability of this second step is 1. Therefore, the probability of the entire cascade is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\nBased on this analysis, the probability for the route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ is 1/3.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 - Incorrect probability.\nB) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3 - Correct route and probability.\nC) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 - Incorrect probability.\nD) ⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3 - Incomplete and incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>"
