    "To find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary pion (Pi+), we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\nPi(+) → mu(+) + nu\n\nGiven:\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+) (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu(+) (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The Pi(+) is stationary, meaning its initial momentum is zero.\n*   The neutrino (nu) is assumed to be massless (m_ν = 0), which is a standard approximation in this context.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion, E_π = m_πc². This energy is converted into the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\nE_π = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial momentum is zero, the final momenta of the muon (p_μ) and the neutrino (p_ν) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\np_μ = p_ν = p\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its rest mass (m) and momentum (p) by the equation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\nFor the muon: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\nFor the massless neutrino: E_ν = pc\n\n**4. Calculation:**\nFrom the conservation of energy, we have E_μ = E_π - E_ν = m_πc² - pc.\n\nNow, we substitute this into the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nSimplifying the equation to solve for the momentum (p):\n(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)\np = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]c\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy of the neutrino:\nE_ν = pc = [(m_π)² - (m_μ)²]c² / [2(m_π)]\nE_ν = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\nE_ν = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / 279.2\nE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nSince the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy (KE_ν) is equal to its total energy.\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nNext, we find the total energy of the muon using the conservation of energy:\nE_μ = m_πc² - E_ν\nE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ) is its total energy minus its rest mass energy.\nKE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²\nKE_μ = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.1 MeV**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the muon and the neutrino are approximately 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. This matches one of the provided options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
