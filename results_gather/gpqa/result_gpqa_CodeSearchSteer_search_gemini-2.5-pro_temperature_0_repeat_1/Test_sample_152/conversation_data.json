    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the correct products and reactants.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor**:\n    *   **Michael Donor**: Dimethyl malonate is a classic Michael donor. The strong base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the acidic α-carbon located between the two ester groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon attached to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic and will be attacked by the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism**:\n    *   The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   This conjugate addition (1,4-addition) forms a new carbon-carbon bond.\n    *   The resulting enolate intermediate is then protonated by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Name**:\n    *   The attack of the dimethyl malonate enolate [⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂] onto the β-carbon of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate [p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃] results in the adduct: p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃.\n    *   To name this compound according to the options, we identify the main propane chain that includes the carbons bearing the carboxylate groups. The structure can be seen as a propane chain substituted at C1 (with two methoxycarbonyl groups), C2 (with a p-tolyl group), and C3 (with one methoxycarbonyl group). Rearranging the drawing of the molecule clarifies this: (CH₃OOC)CH₂–CH(p-tolyl)–CH(COOCH₃)₂.\n    *   The IUPAC name for this structure is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) → (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor**:\n    *   **Michael Donor**: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone. Enamines are excellent nucleophiles (Michael donors) in a process known as the Stork enamine synthesis. The nucleophilic carbon is the α-carbon of the original ketone.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, making it a good Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism**:\n    *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an intermediate iminium salt.\n    *   The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt back to a carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Name**:\n    *   The reaction forms a new bond between the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone and the β-carbon of the butanenitrile.\n    *   After hydrolysis, the product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2) with a `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group.\n    *   The major final product is the more stable keto form. The systematic name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants from the Product (Retrosynthesis)**:\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we need to identify the starting Michael donor (C).\n    *   **Product**: 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n    *   The reaction forms a new C-C bond between the donor's nucleophilic carbon and the acceptor's β-carbon.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthetic Analysis**:\n    *   The substituent on the product is the `–CH₂CH₂COCH₃` group, which comes from the MVK acceptor (`CH₂=CHCOCH₃`).\n    *   This group is attached to C2 of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring.\n    *   In a Michael reaction, the bond forms between the nucleophilic α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor. Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of the dione ring, formed by deprotonation at the highly acidic C2 position (between the two carbonyls) by the base (KOH).\n\n3.  **Reactant C Structure and Name**:\n    *   The Michael donor (reactant C) is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
