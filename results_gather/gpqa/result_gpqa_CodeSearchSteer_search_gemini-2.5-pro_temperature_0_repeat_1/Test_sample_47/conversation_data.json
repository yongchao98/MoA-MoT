    "The step-by-step synthesis and the final determination of the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 are outlined below.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\nCyclohexanone reacts with bromine in an alpha-halogenation reaction. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom. This results in the formation of 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\nWhen 2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with a base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, followed by ring contraction. The final product of this step is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nCyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2) is converted to its corresponding acid chloride by treatment with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂). Pyridine is often used to neutralize the HCl produced during the reaction. The resulting compound is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is selective for the reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes, preventing further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, treating cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3) with this reagent yields cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4).\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO) and the C1-H bond of the cyclopentane ring.\n\nThe hydrogen atoms can be categorized into the following sets:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This hydrogen is unique.\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the carbon of the ring bonded to the aldehyde group. This hydrogen is also unique.\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on each of these carbons (one pointing \"up\" and one \"down\" relative to the ring) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct from each other. This gives two sets of equivalent protons.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. This results in another two sets of equivalent protons.\n\nCounting these distinct sets:\n*   1 set from the aldehyde proton.\n*   1 set from the C1 proton.\n*   2 sets from the C2/C5 protons.\n*   2 sets from the C3/C4 protons.\n\nThis gives a total of 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
