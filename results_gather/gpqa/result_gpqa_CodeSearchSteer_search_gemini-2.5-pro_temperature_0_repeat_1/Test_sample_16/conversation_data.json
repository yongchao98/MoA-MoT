    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in the solution, we must consider the dissociation equilibrium of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the reaction:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe given formation constant (K_f) for this reaction is:\nK_f = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nThe problem involves a solution where the complex is already formed, so we need to consider its dissociation, which is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant.\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium table (ICE table) to find the concentration of the dissociated ions. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions at equilibrium.\n\n| Species | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nNow, we write the expression for the dissociation constant, K_d:\nK_d = ([Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the formation constant is very large, the dissociation constant is very small. This implies that the complex is very stable and only a tiny amount will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can simplify the equation by assuming that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n[Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
