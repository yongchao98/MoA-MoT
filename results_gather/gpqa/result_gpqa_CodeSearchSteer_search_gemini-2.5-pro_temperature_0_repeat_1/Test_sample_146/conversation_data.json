    "This problem involves the annihilation of a proton and an antiproton, and it can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Energy\nThe process begins with a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The term \"slowly moving\" implies that the kinetic energy of the particles is negligible compared to their rest energy. Therefore, the total initial energy of the system is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest energy of a proton is approximately 938.27 MeV. An antiproton has the exact same mass and therefore the same rest energy.\n\n*   Initial Energy ($E_i$) = Rest Energy of Proton + Rest Energy of Antiproton\n*   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n*   $E_i \\approx 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} + 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\nSince the initial particles are essentially at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n\n### 2. Final State and Energy\nThe annihilation results in four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. To conserve momentum, these four particles must move off in such a way that their total vector momentum is zero. By symmetry, they will all have the same magnitude of velocity, *v*.\n\nThe total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy equation:\n*   $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nThe total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n*   $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nGiven that the rest energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$:\n*   $E_f = 4 \\gamma (300 \\, \\text{MeV}) = 1200 \\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n### 3. Conservation of Energy\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, the initial energy must equal the final energy:\n*   $E_i = E_f$\n*   $1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n### 4. Calculating the Velocity\nFirst, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nNext, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to solve for the velocity, *v*:\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n*   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2}$\n*   $1 - v^2/c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n*   $\\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n*   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n*   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n*   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n*   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n*   $v = c \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n*   $v \\approx 0.7688 c$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.77c.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.77c\nB) 0.86c\nC) 0.96c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
