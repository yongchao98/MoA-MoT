    "The problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f**(r) within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The vector field **f**(r) is given by its magnitude, f(r) = 1/r², and its direction, which is purely radial. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence of **f**(r) for r ≠ 0 in spherical coordinates yields:\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² * fᵣ)/∂r\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(1)/∂r = 0\n\nThis calculation shows that the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin (r=0), where the field itself is singular and the divergence is undefined.\n\nTo correctly evaluate the volume integral of the divergence over a region that includes this singularity, we must use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The Divergence Theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field within a closed volume to the flux of the field through the surface that encloses the volume.\n\nThe theorem states:\n∫∫∫ᵥ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∬ₛ (**f** ⋅ **n̂**) dS\n\nWhere:\n*   V is the volume of the sphere of radius R.\n*   S is the surface of the sphere.\n*   **n̂** is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface. For a sphere centered at the origin, **n̂** is simply the radial unit vector **r̂**.\n*   dS is the differential surface area element.\n\nWe can now calculate the surface integral (the flux) on the right side of the equation:\n*   On the surface of the sphere, r = R, so the vector field is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n*   The dot product **f** ⋅ **n̂** becomes (**1/R²** **r̂**) ⋅ **r̂** = 1/R², since **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1.\n\nThe integral becomes:\nFlux = ∬ₛ (1/R²) dS\n\nSince 1/R² is a constant over the surface of the sphere, we can take it out of the integral:\nFlux = (1/R²) ∬ₛ dS\n\nThe integral ∬ₛ dS is simply the total surface area of the sphere, which is 4πR².\n\nTherefore, the flux is:\nFlux = (1/R²) * (4πR²) = 4π\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, this flux is equal to the volume integral of the divergence. The presence of the singularity at the origin creates a \"source\" of divergence, which is precisely what the surface integral measures. The divergence of this specific field is more formally described as 4π times the three-dimensional Dirac delta function, ∇ ⋅ (**r̂**/r²) = 4πδ³(**r**), and the integral of this over any volume containing the origin is 4π.\n\nThus, the value of the integral is 4π.\n\n<<<A>>>"
