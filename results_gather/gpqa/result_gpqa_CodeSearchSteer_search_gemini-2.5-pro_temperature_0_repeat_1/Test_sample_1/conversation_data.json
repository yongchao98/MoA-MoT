    "The reaction sequence is as follows:\n\n1.  **trans-cinnamaldehyde + methylmagnesium bromide → product 1**\n    *   *trans*-cinnamaldehyde has the chemical formula C9H8O.\n    *   The reaction of *trans*-cinnamaldehyde with a methylmagnesium halide (a Grignard reagent) results in the formation of *trans*-methylstyrylcarbinol, also known as (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol. This is a 1,2-addition reaction where the methyl group from the Grignard reagent adds to the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde.\n    *   Product 1 is (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol. It has 10 carbon atoms (9 from cinnamaldehyde and 1 from the methyl group).\n\n2.  **product 1 + pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) → product 2**\n    *   Product 1 is a secondary alcohol.\n    *   Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is an oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols to ketones.\n    *   The oxidation of (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol yields (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, which is also known as benzalacetone.\n    *   Product 2 is benzalacetone. The carbon count remains at 10.\n\n3.  **product 2 + (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane → product 3**\n    *   Product 2, benzalacetone, is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   The reagent (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane is a sulfur ylide known as dimethyloxosulfonium methylide, or the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.\n    *   When an α,β-unsaturated ketone reacts with this specific sulfur ylide, it undergoes a conjugate addition (Michael-type addition) to form a cyclopropane ring across the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The reaction adds a methylene (CH2) group from the ylide to the molecule to form the three-membered ring.\n    *   The final product, product 3, is 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nTo determine the number of carbon atoms in product 3, we can count them from the final structure or by tracking the changes through the reaction sequence:\n*   Initial carbons in *trans*-cinnamaldehyde: 9\n*   Carbons after reaction 1 (addition of a methyl group): 9 + 1 = 10\n*   Carbons after reaction 2 (oxidation): 10 (no change in carbon count)\n*   Carbons after reaction 3 (addition of a methylene group): 10 + 1 = 11\n\nAlternatively, counting the carbons in the final named product, 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one:\n*   Phenyl group: 6 carbons\n*   Cyclopropyl ring: 3 carbons\n*   Ethanone (acetyl) group: 2 carbons\n*   Total: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 carbons\n\nTherefore, product 3 has 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
