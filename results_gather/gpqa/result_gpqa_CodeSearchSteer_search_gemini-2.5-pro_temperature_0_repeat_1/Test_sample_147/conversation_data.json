    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the mass percentage of Fluorine in substance A2.\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nThe molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol. The mass percentage can be expressed as:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n\nSolving for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * (n * 19.00) = n * 19.00\n0.3196 * M(Y) = (n * 19.00) * (1 - 0.3196)\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nWe can test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible atomic mass for element Y.\n*   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Calcium, Ca)\n*   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Bromine, Br)\n*   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.3 g/mol (similar to Antimony, Sb)\n*   If n = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (similar to Dysprosium, Dy)\n\nLet's check the fluorine percentage for KrF₂. The molar mass of Krypton (Kr) is 83.8 g/mol.\nM(KrF₂) = 83.8 + 2 * 19.00 = 121.8 g/mol.\nɷF in KrF₂ = (2 * 19.00) / 121.8 = 0.312 or 31.2%. This value is very close to the 31.96% given in the problem. This suggests that **Y is Krypton (Kr)** and **A2 is KrF₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify substances A1 and A3 based on Y = Krypton.\n\n*   **Substance A1**: It is described as a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine (F₂). The decomposition reaction is A1 → KrF₂ + F₂. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride of krypton, specifically **A1 = KrF₄**.\n*   **A1's properties**: A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. KrF₄, being a very unstable and powerful fluorinating agent, would be expected to oxidize xenon. The \"bright-red\" color is likely an inaccuracy in the problem statement, as krypton fluorides are colorless solids.\n*   **Substance A3**: It is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Kr) and also interacts with xenon. The direct fluorination of krypton gas produces krypton difluoride (Kr + F₂ → KrF₂). So, **A3 = KrF₂**. KrF₂ is known to react with and fluorinate xenon (e.g., 3 KrF₂ + Xe → XeF₆ + 3 Kr).\n\n### Step 3: Reconcile the \"Five Compounds\" Clue.\n\nThe problem states that five binary compounds of fluorine with Y are known and lists A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. Our analysis shows A2 = A3 = KrF₂. This is a contradiction if all five must be unique. However, in the context of such problems, it is common for there to be inconsistencies or for the list to contain repetitions. The strong chemical evidence pointing to Krypton suggests we should proceed despite this apparent contradiction. The known stable binary fluorides of krypton are KrF₂ and KrF₄.\n\n### Step 4: Identify substance A4.\n\nWe have identified A1 = KrF₄ and A2 = A3 = KrF₂. The substance A4 must be one of the compounds in this series. The most plausible candidates for A4 are the two known stable fluorides.\n*   **Possibility 1**: A4 = KrF₂. Its molecular weight is ~121.8 g/mol.\n*   **Possibility 2**: A4 = KrF₄. Its molecular weight is ~159.8 g/mol.\n\nLet's examine the given options for the molecular weight of A4:\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 140-160\nD) 220-240\n\nIf A4 = KrF₂, its molecular weight (121.8 g/mol) falls into range A.\nIf A4 = KrF₄, its molecular weight (159.8 g/mol) falls into range C.\n\nThe problem provides no further information to definitively distinguish whether A4 is KrF₂ or KrF₄. However, KrF₄ is the higher, more reactive fluoride (A1), and it is plausible that it is the subject of the subsequent reaction described. Assuming A4 is the more complex fluoride, KrF₄, its molecular weight is 159.8 g/mol.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most consistent hypothesis identifies the element Y as Krypton. This leads to the identification of A4 as most likely being KrF₄, with a molecular weight of approximately 159.8 g/mol. This value falls within the range of 140-160.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (KrF₄) is 83.8 + (4 * 19.00) = 159.8 g/mol. This value is in the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<C>>>"
