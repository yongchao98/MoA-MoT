  "question": "Researchers are attempting to detect transits of two Earth-like planets: Planet_1 and Planet_2.

    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Transit Probability:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star, for a circular orbit, is the ratio of the star's radius (R_s) to the planet's semi-major axis (a).\n    *   P_transit ≈ R_s / a\n\n2.  **Information provided:**\n    *   Orbital period of Planet 2 is three times that of Planet 1: P₂ = 3 * P₁\n    *   The mass of the host star of Planet 1 is twice that of the host star of Planet 2: M_s₁ = 2 * M_s₂\n    *   The radii of both host stars are equal: R_s₁ = R_s₂\n\n3.  **Ratio of Transit Probabilities:** We want to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet 1 to that of Planet 2.\n    *   Ratio = P_transit(Planet 1) / P_transit(Planet 2)\n    *   Ratio = (R_s₁ / a₁) / (R_s₂ / a₂)\n    *   Since R_s₁ = R_s₂, the equation simplifies to: Ratio = a₂ / a₁\n\n4.  **Kepler's Third Law:** To find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁), we use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion. The law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) and inversely proportional to the mass of the star (M_s).\n    *   P² ∝ a³ / M_s\n    *   Rearranging for the semi-major axis: a³ ∝ P² * M_s\n    *   Therefore: a ∝ (P² * M_s)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can calculate the ratio a₂ / a₁.\n    *   a₁ ∝ (P₁² * M_s₁)^(1/3)\n    *   a₂ ∝ (P₂² * M_s₂)^(1/3)\n    *   a₂ / a₁ = [ (P₂² * M_s₂) / (P₁² * M_s₁) ]^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute the known values:** We substitute the given relationships (P₂ = 3 * P₁ and M_s₁ = 2 * M_s₂) into the equation.\n    *   a₂ / a₁ = [ ((3 * P₁)² * M_s₂) / (P₁² * (2 * M_s₂)) ]^(1/3)\n    *   a₂ / a₁ = [ (9 * P₁² * M_s₂) / (2 * P₁² * M_s₂) ]^(1/3)\n    *   The terms P₁² and M_s₂ cancel out: a₂ / a₁ = (9 / 2)^(1/3)\n    *   a₂ / a₁ = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is approximately 1.65.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The transit probability of Planet 1 is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet 2. This means that Planet 1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
