    "Based on the provided analytical data, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why this conclusion is the most logical:\n\n*   **Â¹H NMR Data:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with roughly equal integrals that sum to one proton, indicates the presence of two different chemical species in a nearly 1:1 ratio. In diastereomers, the atoms are arranged differently in 3D space, which can lead to different chemical environments for protons, resulting in separate peaks in the NMR spectrum. While most protons in the two diastereomers might have very similar chemical shifts, making the rest of the spectrum appear \"consistent,\" a proton near a stereocenter can show a noticeable difference.\n\n*   **LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Separation (LC):** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can therefore be separated by standard liquid chromatography (LC) techniques. The observation of two clearly defined peaks of equal intensity confirms the presence of two compounds in a 1:1 ratio that can be chromatographically resolved.\n    *   **Mass (MS):** Since diastereomers are isomers, they have the exact same molecular formula and molecular weight. This is perfectly consistent with both LC peaks giving the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected product.\n    *   **Elevated Temperature:** This is a critical piece of information. Some phenomena, like the slow rotation around an amide bond in peptides (creating \"rotamers\"), can also cause peak doubling in NMR and LC at room temperature. However, increasing the temperature provides the energy to overcome the rotation barrier, causing these rotamers to interconvert rapidly. On the analytical timescale of LC or NMR, this rapid interconversion would lead to the coalescence of the two peaks into a single, averaged peak. The fact that the two peaks remain clearly defined at an elevated temperature strongly argues against rotamers and points towards stable, non-interconverting isomers like diastereomers.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n*   **A) 'Double coupling':** This is a term for a synthetic procedure to improve reaction yield; it does not describe a type of stable isomerism that would result in two distinct products observable by NMR and LC-MS.\n*   **C) Contamination with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different molecular weight, which would be evident in the mass spectrum. The data shows both peaks have the same mass as the target molecule.\n*   **D) Mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are mirror images and have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be distinguished by standard NMR spectroscopy (they would give a single set of peaks) or separated on a standard (achiral) LC column (they would elute as a single peak).\n\nTherefore, the evidence collectively and strongly supports the conclusion that the sample is a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
