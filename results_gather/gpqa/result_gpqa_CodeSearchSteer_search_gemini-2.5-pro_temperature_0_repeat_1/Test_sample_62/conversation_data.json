    "The initial calculation seems correct. The search results confirm the formulas and constants used.\n\n*   **Rovibrational Energy Levels:** The total energy is the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies: E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B*J(J+1), where B = ħ²/(2I). This is confirmed by multiple sources.\n*   **Selection Rules:** For an absorption rovibrational transition, the selection rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n*   **Transition from Ground State:** The fundamental or ground state is (v=0, J=0). Applying the selection rules, the only possible transition is to the (v=1, J=1) state, as J cannot be negative.\n*   **Energy of Absorbed Photon (ΔE):**\n    *   E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω\n    *   E_final = E(1, 1) = (3/2)ħω + B*1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n    *   ΔE = E_final - E_initial = ħω + 2B = ħω + ħ²/I. This confirms my derived formula.\n*   **Physical Constants:**\n    *   Reduced Planck Constant (ħ): ~1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n    *   Atomic Mass Unit (amu): ~1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg.\n    *   Speed of Light (c): ~2.998 x 10⁸ m/s.\n\nThe calculation steps were:\n1.  Calculate reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My).\n2.  Calculate moment of inertia I = μ * R².\n3.  Calculate the energy difference ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I.\n4.  Calculate the photon momentum p = ΔE / c.\n\nMy calculated result was p ≈ 1.41 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s, which corresponds to option C. The search results validate the physics principles and constants used. No further calculations or searches are needed.\n\nFinal check of the calculation:\n*   μ = (20 * 2 / 22) * 1.6605e-27 = 3.0191e-27 kg\n*   I = (3.0191e-27) * (2e-10)² = 1.2076e-46 kg·m²\n*   ħω = (1.0546e-34) * (4e14) = 4.2184e-20 J\n*   ħ²/I = (1.0546e-34)² / (1.2076e-46) = 1.1122e-68 / 1.2076e-46 = 9.21e-23 J\n*   ΔE = 4.2184e-20 + 0.00921e-20 = 4.2276e-20 J\n*   p = 4.2276e-20 / 2.998e8 = 1.410e-28 N·s\n\nThe calculation is robust. The answer is C.\n\nTo solve this problem, we determine the energy change (ΔE) for the transition and then use the relation p = ΔE/c to find the photon's momentum.\n\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states:**\n    *   The molecule is initially in its fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational and rotational energy levels. Therefore, the initial quantum numbers are v = 0 (vibrational) and J = 0 (rotational).\n    *   For a photon to be absorbed and cause a transition to the next lowest possible energy state, we must follow the selection rules for rovibrational transitions: Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n    *   Starting from J=0, only a ΔJ = +1 transition is possible (as J cannot be negative).\n    *   Thus, the final state is v' = 1 and J' = 1.\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy of the initial and final states:**\n    *   The energy of a state in the non-rigid rotor model is given by:\n        E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + [ħ² / (2I)] * J(J+1)\n        where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ω is the angular frequency of vibration, I is the moment of inertia, v is the vibrational quantum number, and J is the rotational quantum number.\n    *   Initial Energy (v=0, J=0):\n        E_initial = ħω(0 + 1/2) + [ħ² / (2I)] * 0(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n    *   Final Energy (v=1, J=1):\n        E_final = ħω(1 + 1/2) + [ħ² / (2I)] * 1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n\n3.  **Calculate the energy difference (ΔE):**\n    *   The energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the states.\n        ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - (1/2)ħω = ħω + ħ²/I\n\n4.  **Calculate the numerical values:**\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n        1 amu ≈ 1.6605 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n        μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.6605 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n        I = μ * R² = (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n    *   **Constants:**\n        ħ ≈ 1.0546 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        ω = 4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s\n        c ≈ 2.998 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   **Calculate ΔE:**\n        First term (vibrational): ħω = (1.0546 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 × 10¹⁴ s⁻¹) = 4.2184 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n        Second term (rotational): ħ²/I = (1.0546 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.21 × 10⁻²³ J\n        ΔE = (4.2184 × 10⁻²⁰ J) + (0.00921 × 10⁻²⁰ J) ≈ 4.2276 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n5.  **Calculate the photon's momentum (p):**\n    *   The energy of a photon is related to its momentum by E = pc.\n    *   p = ΔE / c = (4.2276 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.41 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s\nB) p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s\nC) p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s\nD) p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n<<<C>>>To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we must first calculate the energy difference (ΔE) between the molecule's initial and final states. The momentum (p) of the photon is then given by the relation p = ΔE/c, where c is the speed of light.\n\n**1. Initial and Final States**\n*   The molecule is in its **fundamental state**, which means its vibrational quantum number (v) is 0 and its rotational quantum number (J) is 0. So, the initial state is (v=0, J=0).\n*   The transition to the **next state with the lowest possible energy** is governed by the selection rules for rovibrational spectroscopy, which are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1 for photon absorption.\n*   Starting from J=0, only a transition to J=1 is allowed (ΔJ = +1), as the rotational quantum number cannot be negative.\n*   Therefore, the final state is (v=1, J=1).\n\n**2. Energy Calculation**\nThe energy for a given rovibrational state (v, J) in the non-rigid rotor model is:\nE(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J+1)\nWhere:\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.0546 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   ω is the angular frequency of vibration (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s)\n*   I is the moment of inertia of the molecule\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (ΔE) is the difference between the final and initial energy states:\n*   E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(1/2) + 0 = (1/2)ħω\n*   E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) * 1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n*   ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - (1/2)ħω = ħω + ħ²/I\n\n**3. Calculating the Moment of Inertia (I)**\nThe moment of inertia is I = μR², where μ is the reduced mass and R is the bond length.\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    Using the conversion 1 amu ≈ 1.6605 × 10⁻²⁷ kg:\n    μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.6605 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μR² = (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I ≈ 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n**4. Calculating the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\nNow we can calculate the two parts of the energy difference:\n*   Vibrational energy term: ħω = (1.0546 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.2184 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   Rotational energy term: ħ²/I = (1.0546 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 0.0921 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   Total energy difference: ΔE = (4.2184 + 0.0921) × 10⁻²⁰ J = 4.2276 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n**5. Calculating the Photon's Momentum (p)**\nFinally, we calculate the momentum using p = ΔE/c, where c ≈ 2.998 × 10⁸ m/s.\n*   p = (4.2276 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)\n*   p ≈ 1.41 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
