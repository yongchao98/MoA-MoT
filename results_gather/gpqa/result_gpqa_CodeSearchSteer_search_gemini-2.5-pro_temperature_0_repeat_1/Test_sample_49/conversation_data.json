    "The number of loops in a Feynman diagram can be determined from the mathematical expression for its amplitude, particularly from the factors related to loop integrals. In four-dimensional spacetime, calculations using dimensional regularization show that each loop in a diagram typically contributes a factor of `1/(4π)^2` to the final expression.\n\nThe expression found on the note is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4π)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nThe key term for determining the number of loops is `1/(4π)^6`. If we denote the number of loops by `L`, the relationship based on the standard loop integration in dimensional regularization is:\n\n`(1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/(4π)^(2L)`\n\nBy comparing this with the term in the given expression, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L` gives:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nThe other components of the expression are consistent with a three-loop diagram. The terms `alpha^3` and `g^2` represent the coupling constants associated with the vertices of the diagram. The numerical factors `sqrt(2)` and `8` arise from the specific topology and symmetry of the diagram, while `(Q/M)^2` is a ratio of energy scales that often appears in such calculations. However, the power of the `1/(4π)` factor is the most direct indicator of the number of loops.\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained three loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
