    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Transit Condition:** A planet exhibits a transit when it passes in front of its host star as seen from the observer. The geometry of this event is described by the impact parameter, `b`. The impact parameter is the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at the point of closest approach, normalized by the star's radius (`Rₛ`). For a transit to occur, the center of the planet must pass over the star's disk, which means the impact parameter `b` must be less than or equal to 1 (`b ≤ 1`). An occultation is when the planet passes behind the star. For a circular orbit, if a transit occurs, an occultation will also occur.\n\n2.  **Using Information from Planet 1:** We are given that the first planet has an impact parameter `b₁ = 0.2`. The formula for the impact parameter is:\n    `b = (a * cos(i)) / Rₛ`\n    where `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit and `i` is the orbital inclination (the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky).\n    For Planet 1, we have:\n    `0.2 = (a₁ * cos(i)) / Rₛ`\n    This can be rearranged to:\n    `a₁ * cos(i) = 0.2 * Rₛ`\n\n3.  **Condition for Planet 2:** The problem states that both planets share the same orbital plane, which means the inclination `i` is the same for both. We want to find the maximum orbital period for the second planet (`P₂`) that still allows for a transit. A longer orbital period implies a larger semi-major axis (`a₂`) according to Kepler's Third Law. The largest possible semi-major axis for a transit corresponds to the largest possible impact parameter, which is the limiting case of a \"grazing\" transit where `b₂ = 1`.\n    For Planet 2 at this limit:\n    `1 = (a₂ * cos(i)) / Rₛ`\n    This can be rearranged to:\n    `a₂ * cos(i) = 1 * Rₛ`\n\n4.  **Relating the Semi-Major Axes:** Now we have two expressions, one for each planet. By taking the ratio of the expression for Planet 2 to that of Planet 1, we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n    `(a₂ * cos(i)) / (a₁ * cos(i)) = (1 * Rₛ) / (0.2 * Rₛ)`\n    The `cos(i)` and `Rₛ` terms cancel out, leaving:\n    `a₂ / a₁ = 1 / 0.2 = 5`\n    This means the semi-major axis of the second planet is 5 times larger than that of the first planet.\n\n5.  **Applying Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that for objects orbiting the same central star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`P² ∝ a³`). We can write this as a ratio for our two planets:\n    `(P₂ / P₁)² = (a₂ / a₁)`³\n\n6.  **Calculating the Maximum Period for Planet 2:** We can now substitute the known values into this equation. We know `P₁ = 3` days and we found that `a₂ / a₁ = 5`.\n    `(P₂ / 3)² = 5³`\n    `(P₂ / 3)² = 125`\n    `P₂ / 3 = √125`\n    `P₂ = 3 * √125`\n    Calculating the value:\n    `√125 ≈ 11.18`\n    `P₂ ≈ 3 * 11.18 ≈ 33.54` days.\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet to still show transit and occultation events is approximately 33.5 days. The radii of the planets and the star were not needed for this specific calculation, as the limiting condition for a transit is defined by the impact parameter `b ≤ 1`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
