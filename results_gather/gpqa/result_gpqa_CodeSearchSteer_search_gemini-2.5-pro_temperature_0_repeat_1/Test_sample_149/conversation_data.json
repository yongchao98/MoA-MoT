    "The final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets integrating to two protons each, strongly indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet for two protons suggests a methylene group (-CH2-) coupled to a single proton, which is consistent with the aldehyde proton.\n*   **Structure Determination:** Assembling these fragments leads to the structure 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde. The para-substituted ring contains an amino group (-NH2) and a -CH2CHO side chain. The formula C8H9NO is consistent with this structure.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    *   This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt.\n    *   2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde is transformed into 2-(4-diazoniophenyl)acetaldehyde chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    *   Adding water and warming the solution hydrolyzes the diazonium salt, replacing the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The product at this stage is 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    *   Aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base, and the presence of heat indicates that a condensation reaction will occur.\n    *   The reaction is a self-aldol condensation of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde. This molecule has acidic α-protons (on the carbon adjacent to the aldehyde group).\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an α-proton from one molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde to form an enolate.\n        2.  This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde.\n        3.  An intermediate aldol addition product, 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option C), is formed.\n        4.  With heating, this intermediate undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The acidic proton on the α-carbon (C2) and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) are eliminated.\n        5.  This elimination forms a carbon-carbon double bond, resulting in a conjugated system. The final product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   **Final Product:** The structure formed after dehydration is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the reaction, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
