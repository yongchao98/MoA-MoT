    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Define the initial and final states\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `E_M = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   The more massive fragment is `m1`, and the less massive is `m2`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest masses of the fragments\n\nFrom the given relationships:\n`m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nAnd for the more massive fragment:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released\n\nThe energy released during the fission (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This released energy is converted into the total kinetic energy (`T_total`) of the two fragments.\n\n`T_total = T1 + T2 = (M - (m1 + m2)) * c^2`\n`T_total = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`T_total = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the system is zero. By conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be `p`.\n\n`p1 = p2 = p`\n\nTherefore:\n`T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n`T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of their kinetic energies:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2 * m2) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow, using the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - m*c^2`.\n\nFrom the energy-momentum relation, we can write:\n`(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`\n\nSince the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), we have:\n`(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`\n\nWe know that `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`. Substituting this and the rest-mass energies into the equation:\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 6. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<C>>>"
