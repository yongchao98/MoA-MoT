    "To calculate the net potential energy of a system where a charge *q* is placed a distance *d* away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R*, the method of images is employed. This method simplifies the problem by replacing the conducting sphere with an \"image\" charge that replicates the electric field outside the sphere.\n\n### The Method of Images\n\n1.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge *q* at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R* (where *d* > *R*), the effect of the induced charges on the sphere's surface can be modeled by a single image charge, *q'*. This image charge is located inside the sphere along the line connecting the center and the charge *q*.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is: *q'* = -(*R*/*d*) *q*.\n    *   The position of the image charge from the center is: *d'* = *R*²/*d*.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from an infinite distance to the distance *d* from the sphere's center. This work is done against the attractive force exerted by the induced surface charge, which is equivalent to the force from the image charge *q'*.\n\n    The potential energy (U) of the charge *q* due to the potential created by the image charge *q'* is given by half of the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge. The factor of 1/2 arises because as the charge *q* is moved, the induced charge distribution on the sphere continuously readjusts, and the work done to create this induced distribution is equal to the work done to move the charge *q* in the field of the induced charges.\n\n    The potential (V') created by the image charge *q'* at the location of the real charge *q* is:\n    V' = k * q' / (d - d')\n    where k is Coulomb's constant (1/4πε₀).\n\n    Substituting the values for *q'* and *d'*:\n    V' = k * [-(*R*/*d*) *q*] / (*d* - *R*²/*d*)\n    V' = -k * (*R*/*d*) *q* / [(*d*² - *R*²)/ *d*]\n    V' = -k * *q* *R* / (*d*² - *R*²)\n\n    The potential energy of the system is then:\n    U = (1/2) * q * V'\n    U = (1/2) * q * [-k * *q* *R* / (*d*² - *R*²)]\n    U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (*d*² - *R*²)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (*d*² - *R*²)\nB) U = - (1/2) * k * q² * d / (*d*² + *R*²)\nC) U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R² / (*d*² - *R*²)\nD) U = - k * q² * d / (*d*² - *R*²)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
