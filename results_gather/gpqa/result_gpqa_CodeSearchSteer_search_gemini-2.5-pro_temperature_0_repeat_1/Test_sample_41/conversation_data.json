    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1.\n\n### 1. Relationship Between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its host star. For a planet in a circular orbit, this temperature is related to its orbital distance (semi-major axis, *a*). The formula shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nThis means that the square of the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the orbital distance:\n\nT_eq² ∝ 1 / a\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the orbital distances of two planets (a₂/a₁) in the same system is equal to the inverse square of the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)²\n\n### 2. Calculating the Ratios of Orbital Distances\n\nUsing the given ratios of equilibrium temperatures, we can calculate the ratios of the orbital distances for the planets.\n\n*   **Ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 2:**\n    Given: T_eq₁ / T_eq₂ ≈ 1.4\n    a₂ / a₁ = (1.4)² = 1.96\n\n*   **Ratio between Planet 2 and Planet 3:**\n    Given: T_eq₂ / T_eq₃ ≈ 2.3\n    a₃ / a₂ = (2.3)² = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1 (a₃/a₁), we can multiply the two ratios we just calculated:\n\na₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n### 3. Relationship Between Orbital Period and Orbital Distance\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a).\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nFrom this, we can derive the relationship for the period itself:\n\nP ∝ a^(3/2)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the orbital periods of two planets (P₃/P₁) can be expressed in terms of the ratio of their orbital distances:\n\nP₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Periods\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of a₃/a₁ that we calculated in the previous step to find the final answer:\n\nP₃ / P₁ = (10.3684)^(3/2)\nP₃ / P₁ = (10.3684) * √10.3684\nP₃ / P₁ ≈ 10.3684 * 3.22\nP₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.38\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the planet masses and the specific albedo value is not needed for this calculation, as the albedo is the same for all three planets and cancels out in the ratios.\n\n<<<A>>>"
