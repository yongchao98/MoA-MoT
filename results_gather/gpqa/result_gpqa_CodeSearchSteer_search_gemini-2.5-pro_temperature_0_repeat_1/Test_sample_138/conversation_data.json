    "The reaction of a ketone with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a known method for preparing α-diketones (also called 1,2-diketones). The reaction proceeds through the following steps:\n1.  In the acidic solution, sodium nitrite is converted to nitrous acid (HONO).\n2.  The ketone undergoes tautomerization to its enol form.\n3.  The enol, acting as a nucleophile, attacks the electrophilic nitrosonium ion (NO+), which is formed from the protonation of nitrous acid. This step, called nitrosation, occurs at the α-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n4.  This initially forms an unstable α-nitroso ketone, which quickly tautomerizes to a more stable α-oximino ketone (an oxime).\n5.  Finally, hydrolysis of the α-oximino ketone under the aqueous acidic conditions yields the α-diketone.\n\nThis reaction works by converting a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a carbonyl group into a second carbonyl group.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction A:**\n*   **Product:** 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. This is an α-diketone with carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 2 of the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Starting Material:** To form this product, the starting material must be a ketone that already has one of the carbonyl groups and an adjacent methylene group that can be oxidized. Therefore, the starting material must be 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one. The methylene group at position 2 is converted to a carbonyl group. The other potential starting material, 4-isopropylcyclohexan-2-one, is the same molecule due to numbering conventions. The other options for A, such as 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, are incorrect as they are not ketones.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction B:**\n*   **Product:** 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. This is an α-diketone with carbonyl groups at positions 2 and 3.\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material must be a ketone with a carbonyl at either position 2 or 3 and an adjacent methylene group.\n    *   If the starting material is 5-methylhexan-2-one, its structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2. It has a carbonyl at C2 and a methylene group at C3. This is a suitable substrate for the reaction to produce 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.\n    *   If the starting material were 5-methylhexan-3-one (CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2), the reaction could occur at either the C2 or C4 methylene group. However, nitrosation of unsymmetrical ketones generally occurs at the more substituted α-carbon. In this case, both α-carbons are methylene groups, but the enol leading to nitrosation at C2 is generally favored. Regardless, 5-methylhexan-2-one is a direct precursor.\n*   The other option for B, 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol, is a diol and would require different reagents for oxidation to a diketone.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the established chemical transformation, the correct starting materials are:\n*   A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one\n*   B = 5-methylhexan-2-one\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
