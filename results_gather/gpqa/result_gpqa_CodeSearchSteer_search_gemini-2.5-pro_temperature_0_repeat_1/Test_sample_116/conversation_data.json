    "Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. This property can arise from a chiral center (typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or from axial chirality, as seen in some substituted biphenyls. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The bulky nitro (-NO₂) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH₃) groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') of the phenyl rings create significant steric hindrance. This hindrance restricts free rotation around the single bond connecting the two biphenyl rings. Because the substitution pattern lacks a plane of symmetry, the molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). This specific type of stereoisomerism is known as atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, this compound has a carbon atom at the second position that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom attached to four distinct groups is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exists as two enantiomers, (R)-methyl lactate and (S)-methyl lactate, which are optically active.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone:** The benzophenone molecule consists of a central carbonyl group attached to two phenyl rings. In solution, the phenyl rings can rotate. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group, making it achiral. Although benzophenone can crystallize in a chiral arrangement, the individual molecule itself is not chiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism in solution.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the methyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond with identical substituents on each carbon atom of the double bond. It possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, making it an achiral molecule. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
