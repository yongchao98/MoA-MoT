    "To determine how the number of stars per unit distance changes, we first need to understand the relationship between parallax and distance.\n\nStellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r) to a star. This relationship can be expressed as:\n\nplx ∝ 1/r\n\nThis means that r ∝ 1/plx.\n\nThe problem states that the number of stars observed varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵. Let's denote the number of stars per unit parallax interval as N(plx).\n\nN(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n\nWe want to find the number of stars per unit range of distance, which we can denote as N(r). To do this, we need to relate the number of stars in a small parallax interval, d(plx), to the number of stars in the corresponding distance interval, dr. The number of stars must be conserved, so:\n\nN(r) |dr| = N(plx) |d(plx)|\n\nFrom this, we can write:\n\nN(r) = N(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance. Since plx = 1/r (ignoring constants for proportionality):\n\nd(plx)/dr = -1/r²\n\nThe absolute value is:\n\n|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²\n\nNow, we substitute the given dependencies into our equation for N(r). We are given N(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵. We can express this in terms of r by substituting plx = 1/r:\n\nN(plx) ∝ 1/(1/r)⁵ = r⁵\n\nFinally, we combine these parts to find the dependence of N(r) on r:\n\nN(r) ∝ N(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|\nN(r) ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)\nN(r) ∝ r³\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance per unit range of distance as r³.\n\n<<<C>>>"
