    "All operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) must respect Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\nThe SMEFT is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators that are built from the Standard Model fields. A fundamental requirement in the construction of the SMEFT is that these operators must obey the spacetime symmetries of the Standard Model, which are Lorentz and Poincare invariance. The Poincare group is the group of spacetime isometries in Minkowski spacetime and includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations.\n\nFurthermore, the CPT theorem, a fundamental result in quantum field theory, states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be symmetric under the combined transformation of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T). Since the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nIn contrast, CP symmetry (the combination of charge conjugation and parity transformation) is not a mandatory symmetry for all operators in the SMEFT. The Standard Model itself contains a source of CP violation in the quark sector. The SMEFT can introduce new, additional sources of CP violation through higher-dimensional operators. The study of these potential new sources of CP violation is an important area of research within the SMEFT framework.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
