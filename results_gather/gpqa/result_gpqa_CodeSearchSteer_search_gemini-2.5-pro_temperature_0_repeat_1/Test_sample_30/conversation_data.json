    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\n\nToluene is treated with a mixture of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing group, meaning it directs the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to it. While both isomers are formed, the para product is often the major isomer due to less steric hindrance. Therefore, Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\n\nProduct 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This combination of reagents is a strong oxidizing agent. While MnO₂ can be used for milder oxidations, in the presence of strong acid it typically oxidizes alkyl side chains on an aromatic ring. There are two main possibilities: oxidation to an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.\n*   Oxidation to p-nitrobenzoic acid is a known reaction.\n*   Oxidation to p-nitrobenzaldehyde is also possible, and this intermediate is required for the subsequent reaction with acetone to proceed via a standard, well-known pathway.\n\nGiven the context of a multi-step synthesis problem, the formation of an aldehyde is the most logical step to enable the next reaction. Therefore, Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\n\nProduct 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂CO) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a base-catalyzed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, because it occurs between an aldehyde (with no α-hydrogens) and a ketone.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from NaOH removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone, forming an enolate ion.\n2.  The enolate ion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n3.  The resulting intermediate is protonated to form an aldol addition product.\n4.  This aldol adduct readily undergoes dehydration (loses a molecule of water) to form a more stable, conjugated system.\n\nThe final product, Product 3, is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n### Step 4: Molecular Symmetry of Product 3\n\nThe structure of Product 3, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, is:\n\n```\n      O\n      //\nO₂N--C₆H₄--CH=CH--C--CH₃\n```\n\nTo determine its molecular symmetry group, we must identify its symmetry elements:\n*   **Identity (E):** All molecules possess this element.\n*   **Rotation Axes (Cₙ):** There are no rotation axes (other than the trivial C₁). Rotating the molecule 180° does not result in an identical structure.\n*   **Inversion Center (i):** There is no center of inversion.\n*   **Mirror Plane (σ):** The molecule is planar due to the extensive conjugation between the benzene ring, the double bond, and the carbonyl group. This molecular plane acts as a mirror plane, reflecting the top half of the atoms onto the bottom half.\n\nSince the molecule possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ), its point group is **Cₛ**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
