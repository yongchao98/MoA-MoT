    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the energy uncertainty, or \"broadening,\" of each level. This energy uncertainty is fundamentally linked to the lifetime of the state by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\nThe relationship is given by:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   **ΔE** is the uncertainty in energy (also known as the natural linewidth).\n*   **Δt** is the uncertainty in time, which can be taken as the lifetime (τ) of the state.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nFor practical purposes, we can approximate the energy uncertainty of each level as ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n**For the state with energy E1:**\n*   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**For the state with energy E2:**\n*   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\nA shorter lifetime leads to a larger energy uncertainty. To resolve the two energy levels, their energy separation must be significantly larger than their combined energy broadening. The broadening is dominated by the state with the shorter lifetime (State 1), which has an uncertainty of approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nWe must choose an energy difference |E1 - E2| that is much larger than this value. Let's examine the options:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is about 150 times larger than the dominant energy uncertainty (10⁻⁴ >> 6.6 x 10⁻⁷). This separation is sufficient for the levels to be clearly resolved.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is much smaller than the energy uncertainty of either state.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than the energy uncertainty of the first state.\n*   **D) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than the energy uncertainty of either state.\n\nTherefore, the only option that provides a large enough energy difference to clearly distinguish the two levels is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
