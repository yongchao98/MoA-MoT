    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance the particle $X^0$ travels before it decays and relate this to the required detector resolution.\n\n### 1. Relativistic Effects\nThe particle is moving at a relativistic speed, so its lifetime in the laboratory's frame of reference will be longer than its proper lifetime due to time dilation.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, which is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest energy (mass, m):\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\nNext, we find the particle's lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$, using the time dilation formula:\n$\\tau = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0 = 7.918 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 6.334 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ s}$\n\n### 2. Mean Path Length\nThe mean path length, L, is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. Since the particle is highly relativistic, its velocity is very close to the speed of light, c ($ \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 $ m/s).\n$L = c \\cdot \\tau = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (6.334 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n### 3. Condition for Observation\nFor a decay to be \"observed,\" the particle must travel a distance, d, that is greater than the detector's resolution, R. The problem states that at least 30% of the decays must be observed.\n\nThe decay of particles follows an exponential probability law. The probability that a particle will travel a distance of at least R before decaying is given by:\n$P(d \\ge R) = e^{-R/L}$\n\nWe require this probability to be at least 30% (or 0.30):\n$e^{-R/L} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the maximum allowable resolution, we solve for R:\n$-R/L \\ge \\ln(0.30)$\n$R \\le -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n$R \\le -(1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n$R \\le 2.288 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe resolution, R, must be less than or equal to $2.288 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters. Reviewing the options:\n\n*   A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n*   B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n*   C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n*   D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n\nOption B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is the largest value that satisfies the condition $R \\le 2.288 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. While a finer resolution like option C would also work, the question asks for the minimum resolution *needed*, which corresponds to the least stringent requirement (i.e., the largest permissible value of R).\n\n<<<B>>>"
