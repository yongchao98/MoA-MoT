    "A textile dye with extensively conjugated pi-electrons absorbs light at certain wavelengths, causing electrons to move to a higher energy state. When these electrons return to their ground state, they emit light at a lower energy (longer wavelength). The color of the light absorbed and the color of the light emitted are complementary.\n\nFirst, we calculate the wavelength of the emitted light using the given energy. The relationship between energy (E) and wavelength (λ) is given by the formula:\n\nλ = hc / E\n\nWhere:\n*   h = Planck's constant (approximately 4.1357 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s)\n*   c = speed of light (approximately 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   E = energy of the light (2.3393 eV)\n\nA simplified and commonly used version of this formula for quick calculation is:\n\nλ (in nm) ≈ 1240 / E (in eV)\n\nPlugging in the given energy value:\n\nλ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530.07 nm\n\nNext, we determine the color of the emitted light based on its wavelength. A wavelength of approximately 530 nm falls within the green region of the visible light spectrum.\n\nThe color of the light absorbed by the compound is the complementary color of the light it emits. The complementary color to green is red. Therefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<A>>>"
