    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the process:** Radioactive decay is a random process that follows an exponential distribution. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic decay probability.\n\n2.  **Define the survival probability:** Let P(t) be the probability that the atom decays within time *t*, and S(t) be the probability that it survives (does not decay) for time *t*. The relationship is `P(t) = 1 - S(t)`. The survival probability is given by the formula `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where λ is the decay constant.\n\n3.  **Calculate the decay constant (λ):** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   `P(100) = 0.32`\n    *   Therefore, the survival probability for 100 minutes is `S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n    Using the survival formula:\n    *   `S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:** Due to the memoryless nature of the decay, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant. We need to calculate the probability that the atom will decay in a 150-minute interval.\n    *   We need to find `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n\n5.  **Solve for the required probability:** We can find `e^(-λ * 150)` from the value we found for `e^(-λ * 100)`.\n    *   `e^(-λ * 150) = (e^(-λ * 100))^(150/100) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Substitute the known value: `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    Now, calculate the value:\n    *   `(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`\n\n    This is the survival probability for 150 minutes, `S(150)`. The probability of decay, `P(150)`, is:\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
