    "To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring during electrophilic bromination.\n\n### 1. Classification of Substituents\n\nSubstituents on a benzene ring determine where the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) will attack. They are classified as either ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions adjacent (ortho) and opposite (para) to themselves.\n    *   -CH₃ (Toluene, 1): Activating group.\n    *   -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene, 5): Activating group.\n    *   -Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3): Deactivating group, but ortho-, para-directing.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions between the substituent and the para position (meta). These groups are all deactivating.\n    *   -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene, 4): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   -COOH (Benzoic acid, 6): Deactivating.\n    *   -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate, 2): Deactivating.\n\n### 2. Ordering the Substances\n\nWe can arrange the substances based on these classifications. The meta-directing groups will produce the lowest yield of the para-isomer, while the ortho-, para-directing groups will produce the highest.\n\n#### a) Meta-Directors (Lowest Para Yield)\n\nSubstances 4, 6, and 2 are meta-directors, meaning they will form very little para-product. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group.\n*   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating, meta-directing groups. It will produce a negligible amount of the para-isomer.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) are also strongly deactivating and meta-directing.\n*   The order of deactivating strength is generally: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these three is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n#### b) Ortho-, Para-Directors (Highest Para Yield)\n\nSubstances 1, 3, and 5 are ortho-, para-directors and will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by steric hindrance—larger groups will favor the less-crowded para position.\n*   **-CH₃ vs. -C₂H₅:** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased bulk hinders attack at the ortho positions, resulting in a higher proportion of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene. For the bromination of toluene, the para-isomer yield is about 66.8%. The yield for ethylbenzene will be higher. Thus, the order is: **1 < 5**.\n*   **-Cl:** Halogens are unique in that they are deactivating but ortho-, para-directing. They tend to show high selectivity for the para position, especially with larger electrophiles like bromine. For example, the nitration of chlorobenzene yields about 64-70% of the para-isomer. Bromination is generally more selective towards the para position than nitration due to the larger size of the electrophile. This results in a very high yield of the para-isomer for chlorobenzene, often the highest among these three.\n*   Combining these facts, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### 3. Final Order\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the complete sequence for the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 (-NO₂) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅) < 1 (-CH₃) < 5 (-C₂H₅) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
