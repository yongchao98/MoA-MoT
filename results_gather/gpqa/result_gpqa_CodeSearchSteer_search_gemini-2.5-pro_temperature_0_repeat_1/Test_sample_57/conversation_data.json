    "Of the options provided, we need to identify the physical theory that does not inherently require regularization to handle infinities at high energies or short distances.\n\n*   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** As a quantum field theory, QCD describes the strong interaction between quarks and gluons. Calculations in QCD involving loop diagrams lead to ultraviolet (UV) divergences, which are infinities that arise from integrating over all possible energies and momenta. To make sense of these calculations, a procedure called regularization is necessary. Techniques like dimensional regularization are commonly employed to manage these infinities. Therefore, QCD requires regularization.\n\n*   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, while not a quantum theory, also encounters infinities. The problem arises when considering the self-energy of a point-like charged particle, such as an electron. If the particle is treated as a true point with zero radius, its electrostatic self-energy becomes infinite, which would imply an infinite mass. This indicates a breakdown of the theory at very small distance scales (corresponding to high energies), and thus it requires a form of regularization, for instance, by assuming the particle has a small but finite size.\n\n*   **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. Similar to QCD, calculations in QED that involve loop diagrams of virtual particles result in UV divergences. These infinities must be handled by regularization and a subsequent process called renormalization to yield finite, physically meaningful predictions.\n\n*   **D) Superstring Theory:** A fundamental motivation for superstring theory is to resolve the problem of infinities that plague quantum field theories, particularly in the context of quantum gravity. In superstring theory, fundamental particles are not point-like but are instead one-dimensional \"strings.\" This extended nature of the fundamental objects smooths out interactions at very short distances, avoiding the singularities that lead to ultraviolet divergences in quantum field theories. While the term \"regularization\" may appear in specific mathematical contexts within the theory, superstring theory is widely considered to be a UV-finite theory, meaning it does not have the inherent high-energy divergences of the other theories and thus does not require regularization in the same fundamental way.\n\n<<<D>>>"
