    "When racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene undergoes self-metathesis with a Grubbs catalyst, the reaction involves the coupling of two molecules of the alkene and the elimination of ethene. The starting material is a 50:50 mixture of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n\nThe general reaction is:\n2 * CH2=CH-R → R-CH=CH-R + CH2=CH2 (ethene)\n\nIn this case, the R group is a chiral sec-butyl group, -CH(CH3)(CH2CH3). The product of the metathesis reaction, excluding ethene, is 3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. This product molecule has two chiral centers (at carbons 3 and 6) and a double bond at carbon 4, which can have E or Z geometry.\n\nWe must consider the three possible reaction pairings from the racemic mixture:\n\n1.  **Reaction of two (R)-enantiomers:**\n    (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene + (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene → (3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.\n    Since the new double bond can be either E or Z, this pairing produces two distinct stereoisomers (diastereomers):\n    *   (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n    *   (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n\n2.  **Reaction of two (S)-enantiomers:**\n    (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene + (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene → (3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.\n    This pairing also produces two stereoisomers which are the enantiomers of the products from the (R)+(R) reaction:\n    *   (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n    *   (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n\n3.  **Reaction of one (R)-enantiomer and one (S)-enantiomer (cross-metathesis):**\n    (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene + (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene → (3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.\n    The resulting molecule has opposite configurations at its two chiral centers. Because the substituents on these chiral centers are identical, these are meso compounds, which are achiral despite having chiral centers. Again, considering the E/Z isomerism, this pairing produces two distinct meso stereoisomers (which are diastereomers of each other):\n    *   (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (meso)\n    *   (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (meso)\n\nIn total, there are six possible, distinct stereoisomeric products formed: two pairs of enantiomers and two meso compounds. Standard Grubbs catalysts do not typically control the stereochemistry of the newly formed double bond, resulting in a mixture of E and Z isomers.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible products is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<D>>>"
