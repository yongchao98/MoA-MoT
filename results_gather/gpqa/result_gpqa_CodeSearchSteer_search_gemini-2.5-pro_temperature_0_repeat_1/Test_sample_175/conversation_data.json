    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Define the Initial State and Operators**\n\n*   The initial state of the system is given by the unnormalized column vector:\n    |ψ⟩ = `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n*   The operator for observable P is:\n    P = `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   The operator for observable Q is:\n    Q = `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n**2. Normalize the Initial State**\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the state vector |ψ⟩. The squared norm is:\n||ψ||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\nThe normalization constant is 1/√6. The normalized state vector is:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\n**3. First Measurement: Probability of getting 0 for P**\n\nTo find the probability of measuring the value 0 for P, we first need to find the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvalues of P:** The eigenvalues (λ) are found by solving det(P - λI) = 0.\n    det(`[[-λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]]`) = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = 0\n    This gives λ(-λ² + 1) = 0, so the eigenvalues are λ = 0, 1, -1.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for λ = 0:** We solve the equation P|p₀⟩ = 0|p₀⟩.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [[x], [y], [z]] = [[0], [0], [0]]`\n    From the first row, (1/√2)y = 0, which means y = 0.\n    From the second row, (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0, which means x = -z.\n    The eigenvector is of the form `[[x], [0], [-x]]`. We can choose the unnormalized eigenvector as `[[1], [0], [-1]]`.\n\n*   **Normalize the eigenvector |p₀⟩:**\n    The squared norm is 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2.\n    The normalized eigenvector is |p₀_norm⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[1], [0], [-1]]`.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P=0:** This probability is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the normalized initial state and the normalized eigenvector for P=0.\n    Prob(P=0) = |⟨p₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩|²\n    ⟨p₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩ = [ (1/√2) * `[1, 0, -1]` ] * [ (1/√6) * `[[-1],,]` ]\n    = (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = -2/√12 = -1/√3\n    Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3.\n\n**4. State Collapse**\n\nAfter measuring P and getting the result 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector:\n|ψ'⟩ = |p₀_norm⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[1], [0], [-1]]`\n\n**5. Second Measurement: Probability of getting -1 for Q**\n\nNow we measure the observable Q on the new state |ψ'⟩. We want the probability of getting the result -1.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for Q = -1:** The operator Q is a diagonal matrix. The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries (1, 0, -1), and the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue -1 is:\n    |q₋₁⟩ = `[[0], [0], [1]]`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1:** This probability is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the new state |ψ'⟩ and the eigenvector |q₋₁⟩.\n    Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²\n    ⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = `[0, 0, 1]` * [ (1/√2) * `[,, [-1]]` ]\n    = (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2\n    Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2.\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Probability**\n\nThe probability of getting 0 for P *and then* -1 for Q is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the steps above.\n\nTotal Probability = Prob(P=0) × Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)\nTotal Probability = (1/3) × (1/2) = 1/6.\n\n<<<B>>>"
