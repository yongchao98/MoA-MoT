    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for two electrons and finding that both correspond to the quantum number `m = -1`.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state given by `|l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n    *   `l1 = 1` and `l2 = 1` since the electrons are in p orbitals.\n    *   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 2`.\n    *   The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is `m = -1`.\n\n2.  **Measurement**: A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, `L1z` and `L2z`, is performed. We want to find the probability of obtaining the eigenvalues `-ħ` for both. This corresponds to the measurement outcome where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    `m = m1 + m2`\n\n4.  **Applying the Conservation Rule**:\n    *   In the given initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome has `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n    *   If this outcome were to occur, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be `m1 + m2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: There is a contradiction. The initial state has a total `m` of -1, while the desired measurement outcome corresponds to a total `m` of -2. The conservation of the z-component of angular momentum dictates that a state with `m = -1` cannot yield a measurement result where the sum of the components is `m1 + m2 = -2`.\n\nThe probability of an event that violates a conservation law is zero. The coupled state `|l=2, m=-1>` is a linear combination of the uncoupled states `|m1, m2>` for which `m1 + m2 = -1`. The state `|m1=-1, m2=-1>` is not part of this combination. Therefore, the probability of measuring `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1` is 0.\n\nThis can also be formally shown using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which give the expansion of a coupled state in terms of uncoupled states. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<l1, m1, l2, m2 | l, m>` is zero unless `m = m1 + m2`. In this case, the probability is the square of the coefficient `<1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1>`, which is zero because `-1 + (-1) ≠ -1`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
