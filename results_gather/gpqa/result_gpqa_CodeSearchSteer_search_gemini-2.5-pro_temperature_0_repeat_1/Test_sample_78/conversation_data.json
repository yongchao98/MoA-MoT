    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product from NMR Data:**\n    *   **`13C` NMR:** The signal at δ 197.7 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically a ketone. The signals at δ 21.3 and 28.4 ppm correspond to two distinct methyl carbons. The remaining signals in the δ 126-145 ppm range are typical for aromatic and vinylic carbons.\n    *   **`1H` NMR:** The spectrum shows two singlets at δ 2.28 (3H) and δ 2.31 (3H), which correspond to two methyl groups that are not adjacent to any protons. The signals in the aromatic region, δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d), are characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring. The two remaining doublets at δ 6.75 (1H) and δ 7.68 (1H) are indicative of two coupled vinylic protons on a double bond.\n    *   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n        *   The para-substituted benzene ring is substituted with a methyl group, evidenced by the singlet at δ 2.31 and the carbon signal at δ 21.3. This identifies a *p*-tolyl group.\n        *   The ketone (from `13C` NMR), the second methyl group (δ 2.28), and the two vinylic protons (δ 6.75 and δ 7.68) form the rest of the molecule.\n        *   Combining these fragments, the structure is (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. The formula is p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3. This structure is consistent with all the NMR data. The molecular formula is C11H12O, which matches the starting material. PubChem lists this compound as 4-(4-Methylphenyl)-3-buten-2-one.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Compound X (C11H12O).\n    *   **Reagents and Conditions:** 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K (130 °C). DABCO is a nucleophilic organic base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The conversion of an epoxide (oxirane) to a ketone under base catalysis is a known transformation, often referred to as a Meinwald rearrangement. Specifically, DABCO is known to catalyze the isomerization of terminal epoxides into methyl ketones. The reaction proceeds by nucleophilic attack of DABCO on the less substituted carbon of the epoxide ring, followed by elimination and rearrangement.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   The product contains a *p*-tolyl group. Therefore, the starting material, Compound X, must also contain a *p*-tolyl group.\n    *   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** Contains a phenyl group, not a tolyl group. Incorrect.\n    *   **B) 2-styrylepoxide:** \"Styryl\" implies a C6H5-CH=CH- group, which is unsubstituted. Incorrect.\n    *   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** Contains a styryl (phenyl) group, not a tolyl group. Incorrect.\n    *   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-. This contains the required *p*-tolyl moiety. The structure is p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2. Its molecular formula is C11H12O, which is correct.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Reaction Pathway:**\n    *   The starting material, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (Compound D), is a terminal vinylic epoxide.\n    *   The base-catalyzed (DABCO) rearrangement of this epoxide would lead to the formation of a methyl ketone.\n    *   The rearrangement of p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2 yields p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3, which is the product identified from the NMR spectra.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the product's NMR spectra and the known reactivity of epoxides with DABCO, Compound X is identified as 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
