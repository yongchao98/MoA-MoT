    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles—isolated north or south poles—exist, two of Maxwell's equations would be fundamentally different. The necessary changes would be to the equations governing the divergence of the magnetic field and the curl (or circulation) of the electric field.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes:\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (Divergence of the Magnetic Field):** In our universe, this law is expressed as ∇ · **B** = 0, which mathematically states that there are no magnetic monopoles. If magnetic monopoles were to exist, they would act as sources or sinks for the magnetic field, similar to how electric charges act for the electric field. Consequently, this equation would be modified to include a term for the magnetic charge density (ρm), becoming ∇ · **B** = μ₀ρm (the constant may vary by convention).\n\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction (Circulation of the Electric Field):** This law, written as ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t, describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, the movement of these magnetic charges would constitute a \"magnetic current\" (Jm). To account for the circulating electric field created by this magnetic current, a new term would be added to Faraday's Law, resulting in a more symmetric form: ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t - Jm.\n\nThe other two of Maxwell's equations, Gauss's law for electricity (relating the divergence of the electric field to electric charge) and the Ampère-Maxwell law (relating the circulation of the magnetic field to electric current and changing electric fields), would remain unchanged as they describe phenomena independent of magnetic charges.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the equations related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation of the electric field would be different.\n\n<<<C>>>"
