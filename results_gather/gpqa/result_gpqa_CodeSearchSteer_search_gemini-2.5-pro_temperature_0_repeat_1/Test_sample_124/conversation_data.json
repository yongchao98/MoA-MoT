    "The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula $E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number and can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n*   **Ground state:** For the ground state, $n=0$. The energy is $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First excited state:** For the first excited state, $n=1$. The energy is $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second excited state:** For the second excited state, $n=2$. The energy is $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third excited state:** For the third excited state, $n=3$. The energy is $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states that have that same energy. For the n-th energy level of the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy, $g_n$, can be calculated using the formula $g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$.\n\nFor the third excited state, we have $n=3$. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n\n$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$.\n\nThis means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions that correspond to the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.\n\nThe possible combinations of the quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3 are:\n*   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) - which is 3 states.\n*   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) - which is 6 states.\n*   The combination (1, 1, 1) - which is 1 state.\n\nThe total number of states is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10.\n\n<<<C>>>"
