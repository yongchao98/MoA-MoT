    "The scenario described involves comparing two different mean free paths within the same sample compartment of a transmission electron microscope. Let's break down the two situations:\n\n1.  **Mean Free Path λ1:** This is the mean free path of the remaining gas molecules. It represents the average distance a gas molecule travels before it collides with another gas molecule. This is determined by factors like the density of the gas molecules and their size (their collision cross-section). The formula for the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the number density of particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ): λ = 1/(nσ). In this case, λ1 is determined by the cross-section of a gas molecule-gas molecule collision (σ_gas).\n\n2.  **Mean Free Path λ2:** This is the mean free path of the electrons from the electron beam as they travel through the remaining gas. It represents the average distance an electron travels before it scatters off a gas molecule. The number density (n) of the gas molecules remains the same. However, the collision is now between a high-energy electron and a gas molecule.\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in comparing the collision cross-section in each case:\n\n*   **Collision Cross-Section for λ1 (σ_gas):** The collision between two neutral gas molecules is essentially a \"hard-sphere\" collision, where the cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n*   **Scattering Cross-Section for λ2 (σ_electron-gas):** The interaction between a high-energy electron (a charged particle) and a gas molecule is governed by the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron interacts with the electric fields of the molecule's nuclei and its electron cloud. This results in a much larger effective \"target area,\" or scattering cross-section, than the simple physical size of the molecule.\n\nSince the scattering cross-section for an electron interacting with a gas molecule (σ_electron-gas) is significantly larger than the collision cross-section for two gas molecules interacting with each other (σ_gas), and the mean free path is inversely proportional to the cross-section, the following relationship holds:\n\n*   σ_electron-gas > σ_gas\n*   Therefore, 1/(n * σ_electron-gas) < 1/(n * σ_gas)\n*   This means λ2 < λ1.\n\nThe high-energy electrons are much more likely to interact with the gas molecules than the gas molecules are to interact with each other, leading to a shorter average distance traveled between collisions for the electrons.\n\n<<<C>>>"
