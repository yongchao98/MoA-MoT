    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak falls in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n### **3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This singlet, appearing far downfield, is highly indicative of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its integration for one proton confirms this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The two groups of protons are adjacent to each other and thus split each other's signals into doublets.\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule lacks a carboxylic acid, which contradicts the IR and NMR data.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule's structure is perfectly consistent with all the spectral data.\n    *   **MS:** The molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ gives a molecular weight of 156.57 g/mol, and it contains one chlorine atom.\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, which would show the characteristic broad O-H and sharp C=O stretches.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The *para* substitution pattern gives rise to two doublets in the aromatic region, and it has a carboxylic acid proton. Published spectra for 4-chlorobenzoic acid show aromatic protons at approximately 7.97 ppm and 7.58 ppm, and a carboxylic acid proton. These values are in close agreement with the experimental data.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* substitution would produce a more complex splitting pattern for the four aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This compound is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would show an aldehyde proton signal (around 9-10 ppm) in the NMR and would lack the very broad O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid in the IR.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined evidence from the mass spectrum, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum unequivocally points to the unknown compound being 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
