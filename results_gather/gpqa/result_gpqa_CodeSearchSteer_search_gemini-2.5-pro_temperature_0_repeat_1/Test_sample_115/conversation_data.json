    "To identify Compound D, we must follow the reaction sequence step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\nCompound A exhibits two signals in its proton NMR spectrum: a triplet for 6 hydrogens (6H) and a quartet for 4 hydrogens (4H). This 3:2 proton ratio, combined with the triplet-quartet splitting pattern, is a classic indicator of ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The presence of 6H and 4H suggests two equivalent ethyl groups. For the signals to be a simple triplet and quartet, the ethyl groups must be attached to an atom or group with no adjacent protons. The chemical shifts (0.9 ppm and 1.3 ppm) are characteristic of an alkane. The molecule that fits this description is n-butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3), where the two CH3 groups are equivalent and the two CH2 groups are equivalent.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B**\n\nCompound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. In the free-radical bromination of alkanes, substitution occurs preferentially at the more substituted carbon atom. N-butane has primary (C1) and secondary (C2) carbons. The major product will therefore be 2-bromobutane.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C**\n\nCompound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a dehydrohalogenation reaction, which proceeds via an E2 elimination mechanism to form an alkene. According to Zaitsev's rule, the major product is the more substituted alkene. Elimination of HBr from 2-bromobutane can form but-1-ene (minor product) or but-2-ene (major product). The problem states that Compound C has two geometrical isomers, which is true for but-2-ene (*cis*- and *trans*-but-2-ene), but not for but-1-ene. Therefore, Compound C is but-2-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound D**\n\nCompound D is formed from a Diels-Alder reaction between the *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene) and (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring. The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the stereochemistry of the reactants and the transition state geometry.\n\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   Diene: (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol\n    *   Dienophile: *cis*-but-2-ene\n\n*   **Stereochemical Rules:**\n    1.  **Dienophile Stereochemistry:** The reaction is stereospecific. Since the dienophile is *cis*, the two methyl groups will be *cis* in the final product.\n    2.  **Diene Stereochemistry:** For an (E,E)-diene, the two \"outside\" substituents on the s-cis conformation end up *trans* in the product, while the two \"inside\" substituents end up *cis*. For (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol, the s-cis conformation places the -OH group and the -CH3 group on the \"inside,\" meaning they will be *cis* to each other in the product.\n    3.  **Endo/Exo Selectivity:** The reaction can proceed through an *endo* or *exo* transition state. The *endo* product is often kinetically favored due to secondary orbital interactions. However, significant steric hindrance can favor the formation of the more thermodynamically stable *exo* product. In this case, an *endo* approach would lead to severe steric clash between the substituents on the diene (-OH and -CH3) and the dienophile (two -CH3 groups). Therefore, the reaction is expected to proceed through an *exo* transition state.\n\n*   **Determining the Product's Stereochemistry (Exo Pathway):**\n    *   The -OH at C1 and the -CH3 at C4 are *cis* (from diene stereochemistry).\n    *   The -CH3 at C5 and the -CH3 at C6 are *cis* (from dienophile stereochemistry).\n    *   In the *exo* transition state, the dienophile's substituents ({C5-Me, C6-Me}) are positioned *trans* to the diene's \"inside\" substituents ({C1-OH, C4-Me}).\n    *   Assigning relative positions: Let the C1-OH and C4-Me be \"up.\" Then the C5-Me and C6-Me must be \"down.\"\n\n*   **Assigning Absolute Configuration (R/S):**\n    *   Based on this relative stereochemistry (C1-OH up, C4-Me up, C5-Me down, C6-Me down), the absolute configuration of the chiral centers is calculated to be **(1S, 4R, 5S, 6R)**.\n\nThis configuration matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
