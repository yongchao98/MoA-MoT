    "The problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation as it applies to particle decay. The fraction of particles that survive after a certain time is determined by their proper lifetime and the time dilation effect due to their high velocity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Survival Probability:** The probability `P` that a particle survives for a time `t` in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay law. This law depends on the particle's mean proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) and the Lorentz factor `γ`. The formula is:\n    `P(t) = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`\n    The time `t` it takes for the particles to reach the detector wall is the radius of the detector `R` divided by the particle's velocity `v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t ≈ R / c`.\n    Substituting this into the survival equation, we get the fraction of particles `N/N₀` reaching the wall:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n2.  **Applying the Initial Conditions:** We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁` is 20, one-third of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   `N/N₀ = 1/3`\n    *   `R = 30 m`\n\n    Plugging these values into the equation:\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ))`\n\n    To solve for the unknown `c * τ` term, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)`\n    `-ln(3) = -1.5 / (c * τ)`\n    `ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ)`\n\n3.  **Applying the Target Conditions:** We want to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which two-thirds of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `N/N₀ = 2/3`\n    *   `γ₂ = ?`\n\n    Using the same survival equation:\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ))`\n\n    Taking the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    `ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\n4.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):** We now have a system of two equations:\n    1) `ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ)`\n    2) `ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\n    We can establish a ratio between these two equations to eliminate the `c * τ` term. Dividing the second equation by the first:\n    `ln(1.5) / ln(3) = (30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)) / (1.5 / (c * τ))`\n    `ln(1.5) / ln(3) = (30 / γ₂) / 1.5`\n    `ln(1.5) / ln(3) = 20 / γ₂`\n\n    Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    *   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    *   `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis calculated value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
