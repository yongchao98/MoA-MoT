    "The search results confirm the methodology for calculating the pH of a mixture containing strong and weak acids and bases. The key steps are:\n1.  Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.\n2.  React the strong acid and strong base first.\n3.  React any remaining strong acid or strong base with the weak species (weak acid or weak base).\n4.  Determine the composition of the final solution.\n5.  Calculate the pH based on the dominant species. If excess strong acid or strong base remains, the pH is determined directly from its concentration. If a buffer solution (weak acid and its conjugate base) is formed, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used.\n\nMy initial calculation followed this exact procedure. The pKa of acetic acid is confirmed to be around 4.75-4.8. However, this value was not needed because the strong base, Ba(OH)2, was in excess after reacting with both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH3COOH). The final pH is therefore determined by the concentration of the excess hydroxide ions.\n\nLet's re-verify the numbers one last time.\n*   **Moles of H+ (total from acids):**\n    *   From HCl (strong): 0.400 L * 0.2 M = 0.080 mol H+\n    *   From CH3COOH (weak): 0.500 L * 0.1 M = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n*   **Moles of OH- (from strong base):**\n    *   From Ba(OH)2: 0.300 L * 0.3 M = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- ions: 0.090 mol * 2 = 0.180 mol OH-\n\n*   **Neutralization:**\n    *   The 0.180 mol of OH- will first neutralize the 0.080 mol of H+ from the strong acid HCl.\n    *   OH- remaining = 0.180 - 0.080 = 0.100 mol\n    *   Next, the remaining OH- will neutralize the 0.050 mol of the weak acid CH3COOH.\n    *   OH- remaining = 0.100 - 0.050 = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Final Solution:**\n    *   The final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH- ions.\n    *   Total volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Final [OH-]:**\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **pOH and pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe calculation is robust and the methodology is confirmed by the search results. The answer is 12.62.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 1.38 (This is the pOH)\nB) 8.68\nC) 12.62 (This matches the calculation)\nD) 8.92\n\nThe calculation is correct.\n\nTo determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the number of moles of acid and base.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each substance:**\n    *   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n    *   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n        Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n    *   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n        Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), the moles of OH⁻ are:\n        Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n2.  **Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n    The strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all available acid, starting with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) first, and then the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n    *   **Reaction with strong acid (HCl):**\n        The 0.180 moles of OH⁻ will first neutralize the 0.080 moles of H⁺ from HCl.\n        Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n    *   **Reaction with weak acid (CH3COOH):**\n        The remaining 0.100 moles of OH⁻ will then react with the 0.050 moles of CH3COOH.\n        Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH of the final solution:**\n    After all reactions, there are 0.050 moles of excess OH⁻ ions in the solution. The pH will be determined by this excess strong base.\n\n    *   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n        Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n    *   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n        [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n        [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n    *   **Calculate the pOH:**\n        pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n        pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n    *   **Calculate the pH:**\n        The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n        pH = 14 - pOH\n        pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTherefore, the pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
