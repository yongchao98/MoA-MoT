    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the mean decay distance of the X meson resonance.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between decay width and lifetime**\n\nThe lifetime (τ) of a particle in its rest frame is inversely proportional to its decay width (Γ). This relationship is given by the formula:\nτ = ħ / Γ\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n**2. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) and β**\n\nThe Lorentz factor (γ) is a measure of the time dilation and length contraction effects for an object moving at relativistic speeds. It is calculated as the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (mc²).\n\nGiven:\n*   Production energy E_X = 8 GeV\n*   Mass m_X = 1.2 GeV/c²\n\nγ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.67\n\nThe factor β is the ratio of the particle's speed to the speed of light (v/c). It can be calculated from the Lorentz factor:\nβ = √(1 - 1/γ²) = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400) ≈ 0.9887\n\n**3. Calculate the mean decay distance (L)**\n\nThe mean decay distance is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory frame before it decays. Due to time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is γτ. The distance is this lifetime multiplied by the particle's velocity (v = βc).\n\nL = v * (γτ) = (βc) * γ * τ = βγcτ\n\nWe can combine the steps using the relationship L = βγ * (ħc / Γ).\n\n**4. Perform the final calculation**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the product βγ:\nβγ = (√(391)/20) * (20/3) = √(391)/3 ≈ 6.591\n\nNow, let's use the value of ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm (where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m).\nThe decay width Γ_X = 320 MeV.\n\nL = (√(391)/3) * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\nL ≈ 6.591 * (0.6165625) fm\nL ≈ 4.0655 fm\n\nSince 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ meters, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ meters.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nB) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nC) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nD) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
