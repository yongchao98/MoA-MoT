    "To determine the time it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their point of view, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n### 1. Identify Key Information:\n*   **Proper Distance (L₀):** The distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. This is approximately 163,000 light-years. However, other sources cite a distance closer to 160,000 light-years. We will proceed with the calculation to see which distance aligns with the given options.\n*   **Velocity (v):** The spacecraft's constant speed is 0.99999987 *c*, where *c* is the speed of light.\n*   **Time Dilation Formula:** The time experienced by the traveling astronaut (proper time, Δt₀) is related to the time observed from Earth (Δt) by the formula: Δt₀ = Δt * √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n### 2. Calculation Steps:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the travel time from Earth's perspective (Δt).**\nThe time it takes to travel a distance in light-years at a speed close to *c* is approximately the distance itself in years.\n*   Δt = Distance / Speed = 160,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c) ≈ 160,000 years.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor component.**\nThis factor, √(1 - v²/c²), determines how much time slows down for the astronaut.\n*   v/c = 0.99999987\n*   v²/c² = (0.99999987)² ≈ 0.99999974\n*   1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026\n*   √(1 - v²/c²) = √0.00000026 ≈ 0.0005099\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (Δt₀).**\nNow, we apply the time dilation formula using the time from Earth's perspective.\n*   Δt₀ = Δt * √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   Δt₀ ≈ 160,000 years * 0.0005099\n*   Δt₀ ≈ 81.58 years\n\nThis result is very close to 81 years.\n\n### 3. Conclusion:\nFrom the astronaut's point of view, the journey to Earth will take approximately 81.6 years. At the start of the journey, the astronaut is 22 years old. Upon arrival, the astronaut's age will be:\n*   Age on arrival = 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 years.\n\nSince the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 years, the astronaut will survive the trip. Comparing our calculated travel time of ~81.6 years to the given options, the closest answer is 81 years.\n\n<<<D>>>"
