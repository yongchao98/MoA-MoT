    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction I\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is a ketone and possesses a single chiral center at the C5 position with (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5, the attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two different products. These products, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers of each other. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n\n### Reaction II\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the two ketone groups in pentane-2,4-dione results in the formation of pentane-2,4-diol. This product has two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Three stereoisomers are possible:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S)- or (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis of the Combined Products\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. In total, there are five different stereoisomers: two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II.\n\n#### Normal-Phase HPLC\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity and other physical properties. It can separate diastereomers but cannot resolve enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomers. However, the enantiomers will not be resolved and will elute together as a single peak. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n*   Assuming no accidental co-elution between the products of Reaction I and Reaction II (which is a reasonable assumption given their different structures), the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will be the sum of the peaks from each reaction.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### Chiral HPLC\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers in addition to separating diastereomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the meso compound from the enantiomers, and it will also resolve the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomeric pair into two separate peaks. This will result in **3 peaks**.\n*   Again, assuming no accidental co-elution, the total number of peaks will be the sum from both reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>"
