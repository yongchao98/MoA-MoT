    "To determine the minimum volume of acid and the final pH, we must consider two aspects: the amount of acid needed to react with the iron(III) hydroxide and the amount of acid needed to remain in the solution to keep the resulting iron(III) ions from precipitating back out.\n\n**1. Stoichiometric Reaction**\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\nThe dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide by a strong monobasic acid (like HCl or HNO₃) follows the net ionic equation:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFrom the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are required for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ reacted = 3 * (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Condition**\n\nAfter dissolution, the 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ moles of Fe³⁺ ions will be in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n*   Concentration of Fe³⁺, [Fe³⁺] = (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10⁻³ M.\n\nTo prevent the Fe(OH)₃ from re-precipitating, the ion product, Q = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³, must be less than or equal to the solubility product constant, Ksp. The minimum amount of acid is required when the solution is at the saturation point, where Q = Ksp.\n\nThe Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is subject to variation in literature, but a value consistent with textbook problems is approximately 1.1 x 10⁻³⁶.\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 1.1 x 10⁻³⁶\n\nWe can now calculate the maximum hydroxide concentration [OH⁻] allowed in the solution.\n*   (9.357 x 10⁻³ M) * [OH⁻]³ = 1.1 x 10⁻³⁶\n*   [OH⁻]³ = (1.1 x 10⁻³⁶) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) = 1.176 x 10⁻³⁴\n*   [OH⁻] = (1.176 x 10⁻³⁴)^(1/3) = 4.90 x 10⁻¹² M\n\nUsing the ion product of water at 25°C (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴), we can find the required equilibrium concentration of H⁺.\n*   [H⁺] = Kw / [OH⁻] = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (4.90 x 10⁻¹² M) = 2.04 x 10⁻³ M.\n\n**3. Final pH**\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is the negative logarithm of this equilibrium hydrogen ion concentration.\n*   pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]) = -log₁₀(2.04 x 10⁻³) ≈ **2.69**\n\n**4. Total Acid Volume**\n\nThe total amount of acid needed is the sum of the acid that reacted and the acid that remains in the solution to maintain the pH.\n*   Moles of H⁺ remaining in solution = [H⁺] * Volume = (2.04 x 10⁻³ mol/L) * 0.1 L = 2.04 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n*   Total moles of H⁺ = (moles reacted) + (moles remaining) = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (2.04 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.011 x 10⁻³ mol.\n\nFinally, we calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid required to provide this total number of moles.\n*   Volume = Total moles / Molarity = (3.011 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.03011 L.\n*   Volume in cm³ = 0.03011 L * 1000 cm³/L ≈ **30.11 cm³**.\n\nThe calculated values (pH ≈ 2.69 and Volume ≈ 30.11 cm³) closely match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
