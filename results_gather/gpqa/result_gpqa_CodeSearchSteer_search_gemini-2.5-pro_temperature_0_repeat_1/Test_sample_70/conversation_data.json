    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and orbital mechanics.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. This temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's distance (d) from its star (T_eq ∝ 1/√d).\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion, the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a), which for a circular orbit is equal to its distance from the star (P² ∝ d³). This relationship can be rearranged to express the distance as a function of the orbital period: d ∝ P^(2/3).\n\nBy substituting the expression for distance into the equilibrium temperature relationship, we can find the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))\nT_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the cube root of its orbital period.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can set up the following equation:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Therefore, the ratio of the orbital period of Planet_2 to Planet_4 is 2 to 3.5.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.83\n\nThus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83. The fact that the planets have the same albedo is important, as it allows the albedo term to cancel out when calculating the temperature ratio.\n\n<<<D>>>"
