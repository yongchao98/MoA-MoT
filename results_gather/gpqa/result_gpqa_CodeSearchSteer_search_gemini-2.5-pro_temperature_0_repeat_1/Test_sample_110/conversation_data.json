    "### Analysis of Reactions\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a Michael addition. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two alpha-carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group), C2 and C6. The C2 carbon is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no protons to be removed. Therefore, deprotonation must occur at the C6 carbon, which has one proton.\n\nThe resulting enolate acts as a nucleophile (a Michael donor) and attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester and serves as the Michael acceptor. This conjugate addition results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\nTo determine the IUPAC name of the product, we must identify the principal functional group and the parent chain. In the product, the ester group has higher priority than the ketone group. However, the naming conventions in the options treat the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n\n1.  **Identify the main chain:** The main chain is derived from ethyl propanoate. The product is named as `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n2.  **Identify the substituent:** The substituent is the cyclohexyl ring attached to the C3 of the propanoate.\n3.  **Name the substituent:** To name the cyclohexyl ring, we number it starting from the point of attachment as C1. The ketone's carbonyl group is at the next carbon, C2. Therefore, the ring is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group. The original substituents on the ring are a methyl group at C1 (originally C6 of the ketone), and an ethyl and a methyl group at C3 (originally C2 of the ketone). Alphabetizing these gives the name `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n\nCombining these parts gives the final product name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name for product A in options B and C.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂), creating a nitronate anion. This anion is the nucleophilic Michael donor.\n\nThe Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The nucleophilic carbon from the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n\n1.  **Nucleophile:** `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`\n2.  **Electrophile:** `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`\n3.  **Addition:** The α-carbon of the nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The product, after protonation by water, is `CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\nTo name this product according to IUPAC rules, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n\n1.  **Parent chain:** The longest chain containing the nitrile carbon has six carbons. Thus, the parent name is hexanenitrile. The nitrile carbon is designated as C1.\n2.  **Numbering and substituents:** Numbering from the nitrile end:\n    `C⁶H₃-C⁵H₂-C⁴H(NO₂)-C³H(CH₃)-C²H₂-C¹N`\n    Let's re-examine the connectivity from the reaction:\n    `CH₃(from butenenitrile)-CH(attacked by nucleophile)-CH₂(from butenenitrile)-CN`\n    The nucleophile `CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃` attaches to the CH group.\n    So the structure is: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`\n    The longest chain including the nitrile carbon is 6 carbons long.\n    Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon (C1):\n    *   C1: Nitrile carbon\n    *   C2: -CH₂-\n    *   C3: -CH(CH₃)-\n    *   C4: -CH(NO₂)-\n    *   C5: -CH₂-\n    *   C6: -CH₃-\n3.  **Final Name:** The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4. The full IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches product B in options A and B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The product of Reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of Reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two results leads to the selection of option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
