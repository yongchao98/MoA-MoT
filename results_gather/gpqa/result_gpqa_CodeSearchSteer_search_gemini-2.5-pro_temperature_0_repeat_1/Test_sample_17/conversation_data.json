    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the notation**\n\nThe notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element X to element Y in a star, compared to the same ratio in the Sun. It is defined as:\n\n`[X/Y] = log10(nX/nY)_star - log10(nX/nY)_sun`\n\nwhere `nX` and `nY` are the number densities of atoms of element X and Y, respectively. The term \"dex\" stands for \"decimal exponent,\" which is another way of saying it's a base-10 logarithm.\n\nThe abundance of an element relative to hydrogen is often written as `log10(nX/nH)`.\n\n**2. Analyze the abundances for Star_1**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`\n\nFrom `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`, we have:\n`log10(nFe/nH)_1 - log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 0`\n`log10(nFe/nH)_1 = log10(nFe/nH)_sun`\n\nFrom `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`, we have:\n`log10(nSi/nFe)_1 - log10(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3`\n`log10(nSi/nFe)_1 = log10(nSi/nFe)_sun + 0.3`\n\nWe can expand the `log10(nSi/nFe)` terms:\n`log10(nSi/nH)_1 - log10(nFe/nH)_1 = (log10(nSi/nH)_sun - log10(nFe/nH)_sun) + 0.3`\n\nSince we know `log10(nFe/nH)_1 = log10(nFe/nH)_sun`, the `log10(nFe/nH)` terms on both sides cancel out, leaving:\n`log10(nSi/nH)_1 = log10(nSi/nH)_sun + 0.3`\n\n**3. Analyze the abundances for Star_2**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`\n\nFrom `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`, we have:\n`log10(nMg/nH)_2 - log10(nMg/nH)_sun = 0`\n`log10(nMg/nH)_2 = log10(nMg/nH)_sun`\n\nFrom `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`, we have:\n`log10(nMg/nSi)_2 - log10(nMg/nSi)_sun = 0.3`\n`log10(nMg/nSi)_2 = log10(nMg/nSi)_sun + 0.3`\n\nWe can expand the `log10(nMg/nSi)` terms:\n`log10(nMg/nH)_2 - log10(nSi/nH)_2 = (log10(nMg/nH)_sun - log10(nSi/nH)_sun) + 0.3`\n\nSince we know `log10(nMg/nH)_2 = log10(nMg/nH)_sun`, the `log10(nMg/nH)` terms on both sides cancel out, leaving:\n`-log10(nSi/nH)_2 = -log10(nSi/nH)_sun + 0.3`\n\nMultiplying by -1, we get:\n`log10(nSi/nH)_2 = log10(nSi/nH)_sun - 0.3`\n\n**4. Calculate the ratio of silicon atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. This corresponds to the ratio of their silicon abundances: `(nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`.\n\nLet's call this ratio `R`.\n`R = (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`\n\nTo find `R`, we can take the logarithm of the ratio:\n`log10(R) = log10((nSi/nH)_1) - log10((nSi/nH)_2)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions we found in steps 2 and 3:\n`log10(R) = (log10(nSi/nH)_sun + 0.3) - (log10(nSi/nH)_sun - 0.3)`\n`log10(R) = log10(nSi/nH)_sun + 0.3 - log10(nSi/nH)_sun + 0.3`\n`log10(R) = 0.6`\n\nTo find `R`, we take the antilogarithm (10 to the power of 0.6):\n`R = 10^0.6`\n`R â‰ˆ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\nThe information about the stellar masses and the specific abundance values for Fe and Mg in the Sun were not needed to solve for the final ratio.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n<<<B>>>"
