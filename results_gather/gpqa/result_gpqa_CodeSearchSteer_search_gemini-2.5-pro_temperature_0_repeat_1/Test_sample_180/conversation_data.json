    "To determine the ratio of neutrino fluxes, we must first understand which solar fusion reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy bands and how the hypothetical shutdown of the pp-III branch affects them.\n\n### Solar Neutrino Sources and Energy Bands\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several reactions in the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle. The key reactions relevant to this problem are:\n*   **The pp-II Branch:** This branch involves the electron capture by Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νe`). This reaction produces mono-energetic neutrinos. About 90% of these neutrinos have an energy of 861 keV (0.861 MeV), with the remaining 10% at 383 keV.\n*   **The pp-III Branch:** This branch involves the beta decay of Boron-8 (`⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νe`). This reaction produces neutrinos with a continuous energy spectrum that extends up to about 15 MeV.\n\nNow let's examine the energy bands in the question:\n*   **Band 1:** 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV)\n*   **Band 2:** 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV)\n\n### Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch\n\nThe hypothetical scenario states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stopped**. This means the production of **Boron-8 (⁸B) neutrinos ceases entirely**. All other reactions, including the pp-II branch, continue as normal.\n\nLet's analyze the neutrino flux in each band under this condition:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** This band contains the prominent, mono-energetic 861 keV neutrino line from the decay of ⁷Be. Since ⁷Be neutrinos are produced in the pp-II branch, which is unaffected, this strong source of flux remains.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** Under normal circumstances, this band would receive some flux from the continuous energy spectrum of ⁸B neutrinos. However, with the pp-III branch shut down, the ⁸B neutrino flux is now zero. The other major neutrino sources (pp, pep) do not produce neutrinos in this energy range. Therefore, the neutrino flux in this band drops to virtually zero.\n\n### Calculating the Flux Ratio\n\nWe need to find the ratio: Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2).\n\n*   Flux (Band 1) ≈ 0\n*   Flux (Band 2) = Flux from ⁷Be neutrinos (a significant, non-zero value)\n\nThe ratio is therefore approximately 0 / (Flux from ⁷Be) ≈ 0.\n\nLooking at the given options, the value closest to 0 is 0.01.\n\nA) 0.01 (10⁻²)\nB) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\nC) 1\nD) 10\n\nThe correct choice is the one that represents a near-zero ratio.\n\n<<<A>>>"
