    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Product 1 Data:** A ketone (IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹) with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O (based on the ¹H NMR integration of 14H).\n*   The reaction involves the substitution of two bromine atoms with one oxygen atom, maintaining the hydrogen count. This corresponds to the formation of a ketone by replacing a CH₂ group with a C=O group. The most plausible structure for a ketone formed from the adamantane skeleton with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O is **2-adamantanone**.\n*   However, the provided ¹H NMR spectrum (4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H)) does not match the known spectrum of 2-adamantanone. Furthermore, the subsequent reaction step involves ozonolysis, which requires the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond. 2-adamantanone is a saturated ketone and would not react with ozone.\n*   This indicates a contradiction in the problem statement. The ozonolysis step implies that Product 1 must be an unsaturated ketone (containing a C=C bond). An unsaturated ketone with an adamantane skeleton would have the formula C₁₀H₁₂O. This contradicts the ¹H NMR integration of 14H.\n*   Let's assume the ozonolysis reaction is the key chemical fact and that the provided ¹H NMR integration for Product 1 is a typo. The most plausible unsaturated ketone that could be formed is **adamant-4-en-2-one**. The signal at 4.79 ppm, while low for vinylic protons, can be attributed to the two hydrogens on the C=C double bond in this strained system.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (assumed to be adamant-4-en-2-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Transformation:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces a ketone to an alcohol. The C=C double bond is not affected.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C-2 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. The product is **adamant-4-en-2-ol** (C₁₀H₁₄O).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (adamant-4-en-2-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond and converts the carbon atoms of the double bond into aldehydes (since they are each attached to one hydrogen). The cleavage of the C4=C5 bond opens one of the rings of the adamantane cage.\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting structure is a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton. It has the original alcohol at C-2 and two new aldehyde groups at the positions corresponding to the original C-3 and C-7. The structure is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol-3,7-dicarbaldehyde** (C₁₀H₁₄O₃).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Identify the most deshielded hydrogen atom:** In Product 3, the most deshielded protons (excluding the exchangeable OH proton) are the two aldehyde protons (-CHO). Their chemical shifts are typically in the 9-10 ppm range, significantly higher than any other C-H proton in the molecule.\n*   **Determine the coupling pattern:** We need to determine the splitting pattern of one of these aldehyde protons. Let's analyze the aldehyde proton attached to C-3 (let's call it Hₐ).\n    *   **³J Coupling:** The aldehyde proton Hₐ is separated by three bonds from the proton on C-3 of the ring (H-3). This ³J coupling will split the signal of Hₐ into a **doublet**.\n    *   **⁴J Coupling (Long-Range Coupling):** In rigid cyclic systems like this, long-range coupling over four bonds can be significant. The aldehyde proton Hₐ is four bonds away from the two protons on C-4 (H-4a and H-4b). If this ⁴J coupling is resolved, and assuming the two H-4 protons are magnetically equivalent (or appear so due to similar coupling constants or rapid conformational changes), they will split the signal of Hₐ into a **triplet**.\n*   **Combine the couplings:** The signal for the aldehyde proton Hₐ would therefore be split first into a doublet by H-3, and each line of that doublet would be further split into a triplet by the two H-4 protons. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
