    "To eliminate an anti-nutritional compound produced by a gene, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that completely disrupts the production of the functional protein. This is often achieved by creating a \"knockout\" mutation. Let's analyze the provided mutant sequences to determine which is most likely to achieve this.\n\nThe intact gene begins with the sequence `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCT...`, which is read in three-base codons starting with the start codon `ATG`.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Codons:** `ATG` (Start-Met), `TTT` (Phe), `CTC` (Leu), `GCT` (Ala)...\n\nNow, let's examine the mutations in the first few codons:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTCTAC...` shows a change from `TTT` to `TTC` and `CTC` to `TAC`.\n    *   `TTT` -> `TTC` is a silent mutation (both code for Phenylalanine).\n    *   `CTC` -> `TAC` is a missense mutation, changing the amino acid from Leucine to Tyrosine. This might alter the protein's function but is unlikely to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTCTAA...` shows a change from `TTT` to `TTC` and `CTC` to `TAA`.\n    *   `TTT` -> `TTC` is a silent mutation (both code for Phenylalanine).\n    *   `CTC` -> `TAA` is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is one of the three stop codons (along with `TGA` and `UAG` in mRNA) that signal the termination of protein synthesis. Introducing a stop codon this early in the sequence will cause translation to halt, producing a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most probable way to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTTTAC...` shows a change from `CTC` to `TAC` (Leucine to Tyrosine) and `ACT` to `GTC` (Threonine to Valine). These are both missense mutations, which change single amino acids. Like Mutant 1, this may or may not inactivate the protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTTTAC...` shows a change from `CTC` to `TAC` (Leucine to Tyrosine) and `GGT` to `ACT` (Glycine to Threonine). These are also missense mutations and are less likely to cause a complete loss of function compared to a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) at the third codon position. This will lead to the creation of an extremely short, incomplete, and non-functional protein, thereby being the most effective and probable method for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
