    "**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. To obtain the final neutral cyanohydrin product, this alkoxide intermediate must be protonated. A source of protons, such as a hydronium ion (H₃O⁺) from a strong acid, is required for this step. Therefore, reagent **A** is **H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is typically achieved by heating the nitrile with water in the presence of a strong acid or base. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, using a strong mineral acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid, is a standard method to convert nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction proceeds by protonation of the nitrile, followed by attack by water, leading eventually to the carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion. Therefore, reagent **B** is **HCl**.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A = H₃O⁺**\n*   **B = HCl**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
