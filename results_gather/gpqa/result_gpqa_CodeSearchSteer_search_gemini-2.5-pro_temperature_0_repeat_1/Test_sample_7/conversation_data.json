    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of the Data\n\n1.  **Role of Individual Genes:**\n    *   The wild-type control has 100% resistance.\n    *   A knockout of G1 (`g1`) reduces resistance to 75%, indicating G1 contributes to the plant's defense.\n    *   A knockout of G3 (`g3`) reduces resistance to 50%, indicating G3 also plays a significant role in resistance.\n    *   A knockout of G2 (`g2`) completely eliminates resistance (0%), suggesting G2 is essential for the resistance pathway.\n\n2.  **Interaction of G2 with G1 and G3:**\n    *   The double mutant `g1g2` has 0% resistance, which is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant. When the phenotype of a double mutant matches one of the single mutants, it indicates epistasis. In this case, the `g2` mutation masks the effect of the `g1` mutation. This means **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n    *   Similarly, the `g2g3` double mutant has 0% resistance, identical to the `g2` single mutant. This means **G2 is also epistatic to G3**.\n    *   In genetic pathways, a gene that is epistatic to another often functions upstream. Since the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others, the epistasis results strongly point to **G2 being the transcription factor** that regulates G1 and G3.\n\n3.  **Interaction between G1 and G3:**\n    *   The `g1` mutant has 75% resistance (a 25% loss from control), and the `g3` mutant has 50% resistance (a 50% loss).\n    *   The `g1g3` double mutant has only 10% resistance (a 90% loss).\n    *   If the genes acted independently, we might expect an additive loss of resistance (25% + 50% = 75% loss), which would result in 25% remaining resistance. The observed resistance of 10% is much lower. This type of interaction, where the double mutant's phenotype is more severe than the combined individual effects, is known as a **synergistic interaction**.\n    *   This synergistic effect suggests that G1 and G3 likely function in parallel pathways that contribute to the same defense mechanism, or that they have partially overlapping, or redundant, functions. The term **gene redundancy** is often used to describe situations where genes have similar functions, and the loss of both is significantly more detrimental than the loss of just one.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect because the evidence points to G2, not G1, being the transcription factor. While \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\" is a correct statement, the primary assertion is wrong.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** \"G2 is a transcription factor\" is correct. However, \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is incorrect; the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%). We also cannot determine if they share a promoter from this data.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** \"G2 is a transcription factor\" is correct. \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" is a plausible description of their synergistic interaction. The statement \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is incorrect, as the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** \"G2 is a transcription factor\" is correct. However, we cannot determine pleiotropy (a gene affecting multiple traits) from this experiment. The statement \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is also incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the options, Option C contains the most accurate descriptions based on the experimental data, despite an error in its final clause. It correctly identifies G2 as the upstream transcription factor based on clear epistasis data and provides the most reasonable interpretation of the G1 and G3 interaction as a form of gene redundancy. The incorrect statement about epistasis between G1 and G3 appears to be a flaw in the question's options, but Option C remains the best fit among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
