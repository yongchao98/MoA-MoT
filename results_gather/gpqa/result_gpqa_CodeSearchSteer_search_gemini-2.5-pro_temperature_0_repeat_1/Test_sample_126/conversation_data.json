    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a type of chemical reaction known as a Cope rearrangement. This reaction is a-sigmatropic rearrangement that is characteristic of 1,5-dienes. The reaction proceeds through a concerted, cyclic transition state and results in an isomeric 1,5-diene.\n\nThe starting material, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene, fits the structural requirement of a 1,5-diene (a molecule with two double bonds separated by three single bonds). Upon heating, the carbon skeleton rearranges. Through this-sigmatropic shift, the molecule is converted into its structural isomer, 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene. This transformation involves the breaking of one carbon-carbon single bond and the formation of another, along with a shift in the positions of the two double bonds, all occurring in a single, concerted step.\n\nThe resulting product, 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene, is the thermodynamically more stable isomer in this case. The options provided include this molecule.\n\nTherefore, the correct molecule formed is 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
