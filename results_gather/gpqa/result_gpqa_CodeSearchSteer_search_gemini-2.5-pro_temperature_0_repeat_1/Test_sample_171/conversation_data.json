    "The search results confirm that the Boltzmann equation is the correct tool for this problem. Specifically, several sources provide the formula for the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels (let's call them `a` and `b`):\n\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N are the number of atoms in each state.\n*   g are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of each state.\n*   E is the energy of each state.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature.\n\nThe problem refers to the \"excitation\" of iron atoms. This is interpreted as the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state to the number of atoms in the ground state (or, more generally, to the total number of atoms, but the ratio to the ground state is standard when applying the Boltzmann equation directly).\n\nLet's denote the ratio of excited atoms to ground-state atoms as `R`.\nR = N_excited / N_ground\n\nFor star 1 (temperature T_1):\nR_1 = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor star 2 (temperature T_2):\nR_2 = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to... star_2\". This means:\nR_1 / R_2 = 2\n\nNow, we form the ratio of the two equations:\nR_1 / R_2 = [ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] ] / [ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\nThe degeneracy term `(g_excited / g_ground)` cancels out.\n\n2 = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nUsing the property of exponents (exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a-b)):\n2 = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n2 = exp[ (ΔE / (k * T_2)) - (ΔE / (k * T_1)) ]\n\nNow, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(2) = (ΔE / (k * T_2)) - (ΔE / (k * T_1))\n\nFactor out the common term (ΔE / k):\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (1 / T_2) - (1 / T_1) ]\n\nCombine the fractions inside the bracket:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nNow, we must use the given numerical values.\nΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J\nThe Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K.\n\nTherefore, the ratio (ΔE / k) is approximately 1.\n(ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K.\nThe unit K in the numerator from the constant cancels out, leaving a dimensionless quantity, which is correct as ln(2) is dimensionless. Wait, no. (J) / (J/K) = K. The argument of an exponent or logarithm must be dimensionless. Let's recheck the Boltzmann equation.\n\nThe exponent is -E/kT. The units are J / ((J/K) * K) = J/J, which is dimensionless. Correct.\nMy derived equation is ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ].\nLet's check the units here.\nThe right side is (J / (J/K)) * (K / K^2) = K * (1/K) = dimensionless. Correct.\n\nSo, substituting the values:\nln(2) = (1.38 x 10^(-23) / 1.38 x 10^(-23)) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\nln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis matches option D. The logic is sound and confirmed by the physics principles found in the search results.\n\nFinal check of the steps and reasoning.\n1.  Assumption of LTE allows the use of the Boltzmann equation.\n2.  The ratio of populations between two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation.\n3.  \"Twice as excited\" means the ratio of the population ratios (R_1 / R_2) is 2.\n4.  The degeneracy factors cancel out when taking the ratio of the equations for the two stars.\n5.  Algebraic manipulation (logarithms, combining fractions) leads to the general form.\n6.  The specific numerical values for ΔE and k are chosen such that their ratio is 1.\n7.  The final result matches option D.\n\nThe reasoning holds up. No further information is needed.\n\nTo solve this problem, we must use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of atomic energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The equation for the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (N_excited) to the number of atoms in a ground state (N_ground) is:\n\nN_excited / N_ground = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   `g_excited` and `g_ground` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's denote the ratio of excited to ground-state atoms as `R`. We can write this equation for each star:\n\nFor star 1 (temperature T₁):\nR₁ = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n\nFor star 2 (temperature T₂):\nR₂ = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in star 1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star 2. This means the ratio of these population ratios is 2:\n\nR₁ / R₂ = 2\n\nNow, we can divide the equation for star 1 by the equation for star 2:\n\n2 = [ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] / [ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights, (g_excited / g_ground), cancels out:\n\n2 = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nUsing the properties of exponents, we can combine the terms:\n\n2 = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T₁)) - (-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n2 = exp[ (ΔE / (k * T₂)) - (ΔE / (k * T₁)) ]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides gives:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / (k * T₂)) - (ΔE / (k * T₁))\n\nWe can factor out the term (ΔE / k):\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (1 / T₂) - (1 / T₁) ]\n\nBy finding a common denominator for the terms in the bracket, we get:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant `k` is also approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE/k is approximately 1.\n\nln(2) = (1) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\nln(2) = (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)\n\nThis equation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
