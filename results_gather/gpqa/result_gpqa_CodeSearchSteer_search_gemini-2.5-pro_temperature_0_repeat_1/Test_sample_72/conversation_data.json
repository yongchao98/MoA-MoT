    "Here is a step-by-step calculation for the relative speed and the total energy of the system.\n\n**1. Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let the velocities of the two astronauts be v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c. The formula for the relative velocity (v_rel) is:\n\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.1428c\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c):**\n\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ1):\n    γ1 = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Next, calculate the energy (E1):\n    E1 = γ1 * (2m) * c² = 1.25 * 2mc² = 2.5mc²\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, velocity 0.5c):**\n\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ2):\n    γ2 = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 ≈ 1 / 0.866 = 1.1547\n*   Next, calculate the energy (E2):\n    E2 = γ2 * (3m) * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc² ≈ 3.464mc²\n\n**Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n\n*   E_total = E1 + E2\n    E_total = 2.5mc² + 3.464mc²\n    E_total = 5.964mc²\n\nSo, the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96mc²**.\n\nComparing our calculated values (v_rel ≈ 0.14c and E ≈ 5.96mc²) with the given options, we find that option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
