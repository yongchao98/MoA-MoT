    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion. They are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the finite speed of light, meaning the fields observed at a time `t` are generated by the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`.\n\nThe scalar potential V at position $\\vec{r}$ and time t is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nThis can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by c:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe vector potential $\\vec{A}$ at position $\\vec{r}$ and time t is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nSimilarly, this can be rewritten as:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions for V and $\\vec{A}$ are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$.\n\nComparing these standard forms with the given options:\n*   Option A is incorrect due to the plus sign in the denominator.\n*   Options B and C use the static Coulomb potential for V, which is incorrect as it does not account for the motion of the charge and the retarded time.\n*   Option D correctly matches the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials for both the scalar and vector potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>"
