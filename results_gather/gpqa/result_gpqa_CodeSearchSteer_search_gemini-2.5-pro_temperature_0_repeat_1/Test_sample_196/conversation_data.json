    "### Analysis of Compound X\n\nFirst, the structure of the starting material, Compound X, is determined from its spectroscopic data.\n\n**Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   A very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n*   A strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n*   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\n**Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield shift to 8.0 ppm indicates these protons are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Alkyl Region Analysis:**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a methine group (-CH-).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** A methylene group (-CH₂-) coupled to both a methyl group and a methine group.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** A methine group (-CH-) attached to the benzene ring and coupled to both a methyl and a methylene group.\n\nAssembling these fragments reveals a *sec*-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. The structure of Compound X is therefore **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and Hydroiodic Acid\n\nCompound X, identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, undergoes a reaction with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkanes (-CH₃).\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\nThe carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring is reduced to a methyl group. The *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring remain unchanged under these conditions.\n\nTherefore, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is converted to **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the spectroscopic analysis and the known reactivity of red phosphorus and HI, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - Correct.\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n\nThe correct final product is identified in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
