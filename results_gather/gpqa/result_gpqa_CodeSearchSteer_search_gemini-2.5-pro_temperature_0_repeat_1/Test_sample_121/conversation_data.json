    "The step-by-step synthesis of the final product is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nAcetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which causes the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. The reagents facilitate the bromination at the carbon atom adjacent to the carboxyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH)\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3)\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in a substitution reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3)\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\nProduct 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n*   Sodium hydride, a strong base, removes a proton from the carbon atom situated between the nitrile and the ester group, which is acidic. This creates a carbanion.\n*   This carbanion then acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an alkylation reaction.\n*   Because excess sodium hydride is used, the remaining acidic proton on the now-substituted alpha-carbon is also removed, creating a second carbanion.\n*   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic attack, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a six-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, we must analyze its molecular symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1 and C4 carbons of the cyclohexane ring and the two substituents on C1 (the cyano and ethyl carboxylate groups). This symmetry makes pairs of protons chemically equivalent.\n\nAssuming rapid chair-flipping of the cyclohexane ring at room temperature, which averages the axial and equatorial positions, we can identify the following distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **The ethyl group (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH2-) are chemically equivalent. They will produce one signal.\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are chemically equivalent. They will produce a second signal.\n2.  **The cyclohexane ring:**\n    *   The four protons on C2 and C6 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They will produce a third signal.\n    *   The four protons on C3 and C5 are also equivalent to each other for the same reason. They will produce a fourth signal.\n    *   The two protons on C4 are unique and equivalent to each other. They will produce a fifth signal.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 5 chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
