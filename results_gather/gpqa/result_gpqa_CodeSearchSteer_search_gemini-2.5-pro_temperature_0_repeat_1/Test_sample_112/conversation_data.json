    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, where hydrogen bonding causes significant peak broadening.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. In conjunction with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), which typically shows a C=O stretch between 1700 and 1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), suggesting the compound is an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbon atoms of a double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the cleavage of the [COOH]⁺ cation.\n\n### Evaluating the Options based on Degrees of Unsaturation\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond. A carboxylic acid contains a C=O double bond (one degree of unsaturation), and the alkene C=C double bond represents a second degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nThe degree of unsaturation is a calculation that determines the total number of rings and multiple bonds in a molecule. It is calculated using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\nLet's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula can only account for the carbonyl group of the carboxylic acid, but not the additional C=C double bond.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula accommodates both the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid and the C=C double bond of the alkene.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O:** This is eliminated because the evidence for a carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O:** This is also eliminated due to the requirement of two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe spectral data collectively support the structure of an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that contains two oxygen atoms (as required for a carboxylic acid) and has two degrees of unsaturation, which accounts for both the carbonyl group and the carbon-carbon double bond confirmed by the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra.\n\n<<<B>>>"
