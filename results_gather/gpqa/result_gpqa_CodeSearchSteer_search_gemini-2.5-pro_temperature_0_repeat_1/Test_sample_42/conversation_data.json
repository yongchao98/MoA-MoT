    "To determine the correct IUPAC name, the structure of the molecule must be systematically built and then named according to official chemical nomenclature rules.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Parent Structure\n\nThe molecule has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a benzene ring. According to IUPAC rules, the carboxylic acid is the highest priority functional group present, making the parent structure **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the carboxylic acid is designated as position 1 (C1).\n\n### Step 2: Place the Substituents\n\nThe positions of the other functional groups are given relative to each other:\n\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** C1\n*   **Methoxy group (-OCH₃):** Para to the carboxylic acid, placing it at **C4**.\n*   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO, formyl) and Cyano (-CN):** Both are meta to the carboxylic acid (at C3 or C5) and also meta to each other. This arrangement places them at **C3 and C5**.\n*   **Hydroxyl (-OH) and Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂):** Both are ortho to the carboxylic acid, placing them at **C2 and C6**.\n*   **Key constraint:** The methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are both ortho to the cyano group. For this to be true, the cyano group must be at **C3** (making it ortho to C4 and C2) or **C5** (making it ortho to C4 and C6).\n    *   If the cyano group is at C3, the hydroxyl group must be at C2. This places the dimethylamino group at C6 and the formyl group at C5.\n    *   If the cyano group is at C5, the hydroxyl group must be at C6. This places the dimethylamino group at C2 and the formyl group at C3.\n\nBoth structural possibilities result in the same set of substituents at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n### Step 3: Number the Ring\n\nIUPAC rules for polysubstituted benzene rings require numbering to assign the lowest possible locants (positions) to the substituents. In this case, the locants are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 regardless of the numbering direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise).\n\nWhen the locant set is identical, the numbering is decided by alphabetical order of the substituents. The substituents are:\n*   **c**yano (-CN)\n*   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n*   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n*   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n*   **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nThe first group alphabetically is \"cyano\". The numbering direction that assigns the lowest number to the cyano group is chosen. This places the cyano group at **C3**. Consequently, the other groups are assigned as follows:\n*   **C1:** Carboxylic acid\n*   **C2:** Hydroxy\n*   **C3:** Cyano\n*   **C4:** Methoxy\n*   **C5:** Formyl\n*   **C6:** Dimethylamino\n\n### Step 4: Assemble the Final Name\n\nThe substituents are listed in alphabetical order, each preceded by its assigned number.\n\n1.  **3-cyano**\n2.  **6-(dimethylamino)**\n3.  **5-formyl**\n4.  **2-hydroxy**\n5.  **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these alphabetically with the parent name \"benzoic acid\" gives the final IUPAC name.\n\nThe correct name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) Incorrect alphabetical order.\n*   B) Incorrect numbering (cyano is at 5 instead of 3).\n*   C) **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** - This matches the derived name.\n*   D) Incorrect alphabetical order.\n\n<<<C>>>"
