    "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts slower in acidic solutions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n**Thermodynamic Strength as an Oxidant**\n\nThe strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° value indicates a stronger oxidant.\n\n*   In an acidic solution, the reduction of oxygen is represented by the half-reaction:\n    O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O, with a standard reduction potential of **+1.23 V**.\n*   In a basic solution, the half-reaction is:\n    O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻, with a standard reduction potential of **+0.40 V**.\n\nSince +1.23 V is more positive than +0.40 V, oxygen is a thermodynamically stronger oxidant in acidic solutions and, consequently, a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n\n**Kinetic Reaction Speed**\n\nThe kinetics, or speed of the reaction, is a separate consideration from its thermodynamic potential. Despite being a stronger oxidant in acidic media, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) faces significant kinetic barriers.\n\n*   The kinetics of the ORR are known to be sluggish in acidic environments, which is a major challenge for technologies like proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells.\n*   In contrast, alkaline (basic) solutions promote faster electron transfer kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction. This is an advantage for anion-exchange membrane (AEM) fuel cells, which operate in basic conditions.\n\nTherefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions.\n\nCombining these two points, the correct statement is: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
