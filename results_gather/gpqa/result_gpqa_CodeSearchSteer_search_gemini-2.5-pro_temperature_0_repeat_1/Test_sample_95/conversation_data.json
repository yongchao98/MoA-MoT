    "To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Calculate the physical size (diameter) of the event horizon from its angular size and distance.\n2.  Determine the radius and surface area of the event horizon.\n3.  Use the Bekenstein-Hawking formula to calculate the entropy.\n\n**Step 1: Convert Units and Find the Diameter**\n\nFirst, we convert the given values into standard SI units.\n\n*   **Distance (d):** The distance to the galaxy is d = 10¹⁰ parsecs. One parsec is approximately 3.086 x 10¹⁶ meters.\n    d = 10¹⁰ pc * (3.086 x 10¹⁶ m/pc) = 3.086 x 10²⁶ m\n\n*   **Angular Size (θ):** The angular size is given in degrees and must be converted to radians for the small-angle approximation.\n    θ = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees * (π / 180) radians ≈ 1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹ radians\n\nNow, we use the small-angle approximation formula, Diameter (D) ≈ d * θ, to find the physical diameter of the event horizon.\nD ≈ (3.086 x 10²⁶ m) * (1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹)\nD ≈ 5.385 x 10⁷ m\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Area of the Event Horizon**\n\nThe radius of the event horizon (the Schwarzschild radius, Rs) is half of its diameter.\nRs = D / 2 = (5.385 x 10⁷ m) / 2 ≈ 2.693 x 10⁷ m\n\nThe area (A) of the event horizon, assuming it is spherical, is given by A = 4πRs².\nA = 4 * π * (2.693 x 10⁷ m)²\nA ≈ 4 * π * (7.252 x 10¹⁴ m²)\nA ≈ 9.11 x 10¹⁵ m²\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy**\n\nThe entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. A convenient form of this equation is:\nS = (k_B * c³ * A) / (4 * G * ħ)\n\nWhere:\n*   k_B (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   G (gravitational constant) ≈ 6.674 x 10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg²\n*   ħ (reduced Planck constant) ≈ 1.055 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\nS ≈ [ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) * (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)³ * (9.11 x 10¹⁵ m²) ] / [ 4 * (6.674 x 10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg²) * (1.055 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) ]\n\nLet's calculate the numerator and denominator separately:\n*   **Numerator:** (1.38 x 10⁻²³) * (27 x 10²⁴) * (9.11 x 10¹⁵) ≈ 339.4 x 10¹⁶\n*   **Denominator:** 4 * (6.674 x 10⁻¹¹) * (1.055 x 10⁻³⁴) ≈ 28.16 x 10⁻⁴⁵\n\nNow, divide the numerator by the denominator:\nS ≈ (339.4 x 10¹⁶) / (28.16 x 10⁻⁴⁵)\nS ≈ 12.05 x 10⁶¹ J/K\nS ≈ 1.205 x 10⁶² J/K\n\nThe calculated entropy is approximately 1.2 x 10⁶² J/K. Comparing this to the given options, the order of magnitude is 10⁶².\n\n<<<A>>>"
