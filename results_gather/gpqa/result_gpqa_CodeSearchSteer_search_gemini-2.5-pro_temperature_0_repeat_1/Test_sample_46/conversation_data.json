    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n1.  **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a clear indication of a primary amine (-NH₂). Primary amines exhibit both an asymmetric and a symmetric N-H stretching vibration, which results in two separate peaks.\n2.  **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is typical for an ester, specifically an α,β-unsaturated or aromatic ester, which usually absorbs in the 1715-1730 cm⁻¹ range. This is slightly lower than a saturated aliphatic ester (1735-1750 cm⁻¹).\n\nFrom the IR data, we can deduce that the molecule contains both a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester (R-COO-R') functional group, where the carbonyl is likely conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring.\n\n### **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n1.  **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal is a triplet and integrates to three protons. This pattern is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n2.  **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a quartet and integrates to two protons. This pattern indicates a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm strongly suggests the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) implies that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as an oxygen in an ester or ether linkage (R-O-CH₂CH₃).\n3.  **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for exchangeable protons like those in an -OH or -NH₂ group. Given the IR evidence for a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the -NH₂ group.\n4.  **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The appearance of two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents on the ring are electronically different, causing the protons on one side of the ring to be different from those on the other. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded, suggesting they are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester's carbonyl group). The protons at 7.0 ppm are more shielded, suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (like the amine group).\n\n### **Evaluating the Proposed Structures**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ (Correct)\n    *   **Functional Groups:** Contains a primary amine (-NH₂), an aromatic ring, and an ethyl ester group. This matches the IR data.\n    *   **¹H NMR Prediction:**\n        *   An ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen (-OCH₂CH₃) would show a triplet around 1.3 ppm and a quartet around 4.3 ppm. This matches the signals at 1.20 ppm (t) and 4.5 ppm (q).\n        *   A primary amine (-NH₂) would show a broad singlet for 2H, matching the signal at 4.0 ppm.\n        *   A para-substituted ring with an electron-donating -NH₂ group and an electron-withdrawing -COOEt group would show two doublets, each for 2H. This matches the signals at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data.\n\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:**\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ (Correct)\n    *   **Functional Groups:** Contains a primary amide (-CONH₂). The C=O stretch for an amide is typically lower than 1720 cm⁻¹, usually around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹. This is inconsistent with the IR data. The ¹H NMR would also show a more complex pattern for the aromatic protons (not two simple doublets).\n\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:**\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ (Correct)\n    *   **Functional Groups:** Contains a propionate group (-O-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **¹H NMR Prediction:** This would have an ethyl group attached to a carbonyl, giving a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm and a triplet around 1.1 ppm. The observed spectrum has a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is indicative of a -CH₂- group attached to an oxygen, not a carbonyl. This is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:**\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ (Correct)\n    *   **Functional Groups:** Contains a secondary amide (-NH-CHO). This would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. The amide C=O stretch would also be at a lower frequency. The ¹H NMR would show a signal for the formyl proton (-CHO) around 8-8.5 ppm and only one N-H proton. This is inconsistent with both IR and NMR data.\n\n### **Final Identification**\n\nThe only structure that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
