    "The search results confirm the key assumptions made in the logical deduction.\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2):** It decomposes into nitrogen gas (N2) and water (H2O). The reaction is NH4NO2 → N2 + 2H2O.\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3):** At temperatures around 200-260°C, it primarily decomposes into nitrous oxide (N2O) and water (H2O). The reaction is NH4NO3 → N2O + 2H2O.\n*   **Reaction with Hot Copper:** Nitrous oxide (N2O) reacts with red-hot copper, where the copper is oxidized to copper oxide (CuO) and N2O is reduced to nitrogen gas (N2). The reaction is Cu + N2O → CuO + N2.\n\nThe initial analysis was correct. The mixture consists of ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate. The decomposition produced N2 and H2O from the ammonium nitrite, and N2O and H2O from the ammonium nitrate. The N2O then reacted with the hot copper, increasing the tube's weight by the mass of the oxygen atom and producing more N2.\n\nThe step-by-step calculation based on this chemical model was:\n1.  Calculate moles of products from experimental data: 0.2 mol H2O, 0.05 mol N2O, and 0.05 mol N2.\n2.  Hypothesize the salts are NH4NO2 and NH4NO3.\n3.  Set up the decomposition equations for an equimolar mixture (x moles of each):\n    *   x NH4NO2 → x N2 + 2x H2O\n    *   x NH4NO3 → x N2O + 2x H2O\n4.  Compare the predicted products (x mol N2, x mol N2O, 4x mol H2O) with the calculated products.\n    *   x = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This fits all product quantities.\n5.  Verify the total mass with x = 0.05 mol for each salt.\n    *   Mass = 0.05 * M(NH4NO2) + 0.05 * M(NH4NO3) = 7.20 g. This was also correct.\n6.  The final step is to count the atoms in the two salt formulas.\n    *   Salt A: NH4NO2 -> N(2) + H(4) + O(2) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Salt B: NH4NO3 -> N(2) + H(4) + O(3) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe entire logical chain is sound and confirmed by the search results.\n\nFinal Answer is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>"
