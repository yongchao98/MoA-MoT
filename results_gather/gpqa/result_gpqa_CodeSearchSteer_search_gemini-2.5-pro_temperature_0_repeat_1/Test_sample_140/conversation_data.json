    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways and products:\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n1.  **Path A: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6:** The amide ion removes the proton from the C6 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in place. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Path B: Abstraction of Deuterium from C2:** The amide ion removes the deuteron from the C2 position. Subsequently, the bromide ion is eliminated from C1, resulting in a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is broken more readily than the C-D bond, so Path A is generally faster. However, both pathways are possible and lead to the formation of two distinct benzyne intermediates.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe amide anion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):**\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH₂) adds to C1. The subsequent protonation at C6 yields **2-deuterioaniline** (o-deuterioaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The amino group adds to C6. The subsequent protonation at C1 yields **3-deuterioaniline** (m-deuterioaniline).\n\n*   **Addition to benzyne (from Path B):**\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Since this intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium, the addition of the amino group to either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, results in the formation of a single product: **aniline**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the outcomes of all possible pathways, three distinct organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuterioaniline\n3.  3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products.\n\n<<<D>>>"
