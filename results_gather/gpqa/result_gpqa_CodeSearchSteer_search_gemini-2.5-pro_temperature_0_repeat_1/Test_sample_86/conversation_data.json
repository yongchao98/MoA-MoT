    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring with two substituents.\n    *   It contains a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   FTIR data indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen attached directly to the benzene ring).\n    *   Based on these facts, one substituent is a halogen (-X). The other substituent must contain the two carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone, with the chemical structure X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n\n2.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Their signals typically appear in the downfield region (approx. 7.0-8.5 ppm) due to the deshielding effect of the aromatic ring and the electron-withdrawing acetyl group. The splitting pattern of these 4 protons depends on the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para). A para-substitution (1,4) would result in a symmetrical pattern, often appearing as two distinct doublets, with each signal integrating to 2 protons.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The three protons of the methyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl group, which has no protons. Therefore, they will appear as a singlet (a single peak with no splitting). This signal is characteristic and typically found around 2.3-2.7 ppm.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        This option is incorrect. The chemical shifts at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too low for aromatic protons. Also, a 1.3 ppm signal is too far upfield for an acetyl methyl group.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        This option aligns perfectly with the predicted spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: These are two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing 2 protons, which is characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, the spectrum for 4-Bromoacetophenone shows two signals for the aromatic protons at approximately 7.6 ppm and 7.8 ppm. Similarly, 4-Chloroacetophenone shows doublets around 7.45 ppm and 7.91 ppm.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons at a chemical shift consistent with an acetyl methyl group. The reported shift for the methyl protons in 4-Bromoacetophenone is 2.60 ppm and for 4-Chloroacetophenone is 2.61 ppm. The value of 2.3 ppm is well within the expected range.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        This option is incorrect. The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        This option is incorrect. It shows only one aromatic proton, whereas a di-substituted ring should have four. The integrations are also inconsistent with the proposed structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe provided information points to a para-haloacetophenone structure. The 1H NMR data in option B is the only one that correctly represents the signals for this type of compound, showing two doublets for the four aromatic protons in a para arrangement and a singlet for the three methyl protons of the acetyl group.\n\n<<<B>>>"
