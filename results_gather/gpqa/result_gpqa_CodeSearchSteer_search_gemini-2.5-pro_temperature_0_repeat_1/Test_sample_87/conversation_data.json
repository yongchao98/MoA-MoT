    "The scenario described involves the introduction of a viral protein antigen via the oral route, leading to an immune response in the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the intestine. The key observation is the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells isolated from these Peyer's patches.\n\nThis points to somatic hypermutation (SHM). Here's a breakdown of why:\n*   **Location and Stimulus:** The process is happening in Peyer's patches, which contain germinal centers. These are sites where B cells, activated by antigens from the gut, proliferate and differentiate.\n*   **Proliferating Cells:** The isolation of a \"proliferating cell population\" is consistent with the clonal expansion of B cells that occurs within germinal centers after recognizing an antigen.\n*   **High Variability in the Variable Region:** The defining characteristic of somatic hypermutation is the introduction of numerous point mutations specifically into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes, including the heavy chain. This process is designed to create antibodies with progressively higher affinity for the antigen. The observation of \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene is the direct result of SHM.\n\nHere is why the other options are incorrect:\n*   **A) VDJ recombination:** This process generates the initial diversity of B cell receptors *before* antigen encounter, during B cell development in the primary lymphoid organs (like the bone marrow). The experiment describes a process happening *after* antigen exposure in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n*   **B) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate and adaptive immune response that involves a cascade of plasma proteins to fight infection. It does not involve the genetic mutation of B cell genes.\n*   **D) Class switching recombination:** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers, often alongside SHM. However, it changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, which determines the antibody's class (e.g., IgM to IgG or IgA), not the *variable* region that binds to the antigen. Therefore, it does not account for the observed variability in the variable heavy chain gene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
