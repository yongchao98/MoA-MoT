    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Induced Charges:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the uncharged conductor, it attracts the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a total charge of `-q` on this surface.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. To maintain its overall charge neutrality, a positive charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to balance the induced `-q` on the inner surface.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor effectively isolates the region outside from the charges inside the cavity. The electric field at any point outside the conductor is produced solely by the charge on its outer surface. The field created by the original charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity's inner surface is completely confined within the conductor and is zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, the induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over this surface. This uniform distribution occurs regardless of the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. In this case, the charge on the outer surface is `+q`, and it is distributed uniformly on a sphere of radius `R`.\n\nTherefore, for any point P outside the conductor at a distance `L` from its center, the electric field is the same as that of a point charge `+q` located at the center of the large sphere. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe specific location of the cavity (distance `s`), its radius `r`, the distance `l` from the cavity's center to point P, and the angle `Î¸` are all irrelevant for determining the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\n<<<D>>>"
