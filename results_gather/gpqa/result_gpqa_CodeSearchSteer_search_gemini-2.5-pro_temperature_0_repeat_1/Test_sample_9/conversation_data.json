    "An analysis of the provided options reveals which exoplanet would possess the highest density. The density of a planet is determined by its mass and volume, which are influenced by its composition and gravitational compression.\n\na) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet serves as our baseline. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\nb) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³ has a density explicitly stated to be similar to that of Earth.\n\nd) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass would experience less gravitational compression. With less mass pulling its material inward, the planet would be less compact, resulting in a lower overall density compared to Earth.\n\nc) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive would be subject to significantly stronger gravitational forces. This intense gravity would compress the planet's matter to a much greater degree. For rocky planets of the same composition, an increase in mass leads to a disproportionately smaller increase in radius, and therefore a higher density. Consequently, this planet would be substantially denser than Earth.\n\nBased on this analysis, the planet that is 5 times more massive than Earth, despite having the same initial composition, will be compressed by its own gravity to a much higher density than the other options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
