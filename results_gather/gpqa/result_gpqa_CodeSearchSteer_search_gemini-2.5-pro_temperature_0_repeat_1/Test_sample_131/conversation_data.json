    "The analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum for a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatic compounds points to a specific pair from the given options. The spectrum shows two singlets in the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) with a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets in the aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm) with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the expected 1H NMR signals for each potential compound:\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it exhibits one singlet for its two aromatic protons and one singlet for its twelve methyl protons.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry, resulting in two singlets for its two distinct aromatic protons and three singlets for its methyl groups in a 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1) ratio.\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (prehnitene):** Symmetry dictates one singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons and two singlets for the methyl groups in a 6H:6H (or 1:1) ratio.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound shows one singlet for its four equivalent aromatic protons, but its ethyl groups produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region, not singlets.\n\nBased on this, 1,4-diethylbenzene is not one of the compounds in the mixture, which eliminates option D.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the remaining options for a 1:1 mixture:\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would produce three aromatic singlets (one from the former, two from the latter), which contradicts the data.\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (2H), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides another singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (12H), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (6H each). Combined, this gives three singlets with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This combination would result in three aromatic singlets, which is inconsistent with the observed spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the mixture consists of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
