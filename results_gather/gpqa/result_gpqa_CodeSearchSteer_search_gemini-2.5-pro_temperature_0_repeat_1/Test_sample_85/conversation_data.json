    "To determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃), and how they react with the proposed starting material, which contains both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group.\n\nThe general structure of the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, a molecule with a chiral center at the third carbon. The two reactions produce enantiomeric lactones, which are cyclic esters. The formation of the product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one (a δ-lactone), requires an intermediate with a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid group on the same molecule, specifically 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol.\n    *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n*   The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization reactions do not affect the chiral center at the 3-position of the starting material (which becomes the 4-position in the lactone product). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product. To produce the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Borane (BH₃) is a highly selective reagent that reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol.\n    *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n*   The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate. The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the same lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in reaction A, the chiral center is not altered during the reaction sequence. To produce the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nCombining these two conclusions, the correct pair of starting materials is A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
