    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (4°C). This is the well-known melting point of water (H₂O) under normal conditions. Therefore, **B is water**.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G:** Heating precipitate G releases water (B). This indicates that G is a hydrated compound, likely a metal hydroxide which upon heating decomposes to a metal oxide and water.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Gas W:**\n    *   Substance X is known to incorporate a heavier isotope and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. This points towards common reducing agents where hydrogen is replaced by its heavier isotope, deuterium (D). Likely candidates are lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) or sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y (likely water, given the context) to release a gas W. The reaction of a deuteride with water would produce deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   Gas W's molecules contain the same number of neutrons and protons. A deuterium atom (²H or D) contains one proton and one neutron. Therefore, a molecule of deuterium gas (D₂) contains two protons and two neutrons, fitting the description perfectly. So, **W is D₂**.\n    *   The violent reaction of LiAlD₄ with water (H₂O) produces lithium hydroxide (LiOH), aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃), and deuterium gas (D₂). Both LiOH and Al(OH)₃ can be considered precipitates (G), and aluminum hydroxide, when heated, releases water. This matches the clues.\n\n4.  **Confirm Substance X with the Keto Acid Reaction:**\n    *   The product of the reaction between a keto acid and substance X contains only two oxygen atoms.\n    *   Keto acids contain both a ketone (C=O) group and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n    *   Strong reducing agents like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and its analog LiAlD₄ reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. This would convert the keto acid (with three oxygens, R-CO-COOH) into a diol (with two oxygens, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), matching the clue.\n    *   Milder reducing agents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and its analog NaBD₄ typically reduce ketones but not carboxylic acids. This reaction would result in a hydroxy acid (R-CH(OH)-COOH), which contains three oxygen atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the powerful reducing agent is the correct choice. **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum.\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing the masses of all atoms of those elements present in the molecule. We will use the mass numbers (the integer sum of protons and neutrons) for this calculation.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The only stable and naturally abundant isotope of aluminum is Aluminum-27.\n        *   Mass of Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen/Deuterium):** There are four atoms of Deuterium. The mass number of Deuterium is 2 (1 proton + 1 neutron).\n        *   Mass of Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** The sum of the masses of the heaviest and lightest elements is:\n        *   27 (from Aluminum) + 8 (from Deuterium) = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>"
