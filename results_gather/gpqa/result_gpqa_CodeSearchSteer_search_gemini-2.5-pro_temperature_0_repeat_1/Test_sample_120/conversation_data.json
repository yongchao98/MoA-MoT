    "The reaction involves an organocuprate (a Gilman reagent) opening an epoxide ring. The fundamental principles governing this reaction are provided and confirmed by the search results:\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity**: Organocuprates are strong nucleophiles that attack epoxides at the less sterically hindered carbon. This is a standard SN2-type reaction preference.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity**: The attack occurs via an SN2 mechanism, which involves the nucleophile attacking from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond (backside attack). This results in an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\nLet's apply these principles to the specific reactants:\n\n*   **Epoxide**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The core structure is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused at the C1-C6 positions.\n    *   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 has a methyl group attached.\n    *   C6 has no substituents other than the ring hydrogens.\n    *   Therefore, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**.\n\n*   **Reagent**: Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate). This provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n\n**Reaction Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Attack Position (Regiochemistry)**: The nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, which is C6. The C6-O bond of the epoxide will break.\n\n2.  **Product Formation**: The attack on C6 opens the ring, and the oxygen atom, which remains attached to C1, will be protonated during the workup step to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The final product will be a cyclohexanol derivative.\n    *   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 remain.\n    *   A new methyl group is added at C6.\n    *   An alcohol group (-OH) is formed at C1.\n\n3.  **Product Naming**: According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (the -OH) is numbered C1. Therefore, the original C1 remains the new C1. The new methyl group is on the adjacent carbon (the original C6), which becomes C2. The other methyl groups are on the carbons that correspond to the original C3 and C4. Following the ring numbering, the original C3 becomes C5 and the original C4 becomes C4.\n    *   The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C, which have a different substitution pattern.\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry**:\n    *   The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the point of attack (C6). The initial configuration of C6 is **S**. Therefore, the configuration of this carbon in the product (which is the new C2) will be **R**.\n    *   The stereocenters not involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps retain their configuration. Thus, C1 remains **R**, C3 (new C5) remains **R**, and C4 remains **R**.\n    *   The resulting stereochemistry for the product is: (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
