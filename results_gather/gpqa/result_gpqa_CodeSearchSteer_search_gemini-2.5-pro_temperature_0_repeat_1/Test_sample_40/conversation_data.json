    "This problem is a direct application of the relativistic velocity-addition formula, a key concept in Einstein's theory of special relativity. This scenario is famously demonstrated by the Fizeau experiment, which measured the speed of light in moving water and was a crucial piece of evidence supporting the theory of relativity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The laboratory frame (S), where the observer is at rest.\n    *   The moving frame (S'), which is the glass block moving with velocity `v` relative to the lab.\n\n2.  **Determine the speed of light in each frame:**\n    *   In the frame of the glass (S'), the glass is stationary. The speed of light in a medium is given by `c/n`, where `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum and `n` is the index of refraction. Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass, as measured within the glass's own frame of reference (`u'`), is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   The glass itself is moving at velocity `v` in the laboratory frame (S).\n    *   We want to find the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). Let's call this `u`.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity-addition formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (v + u') / (1 + (v * u') / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    *   `v` = `v` (the speed of the glass)\n    *   `u'` = `1/n` (the speed of light within the glass)\n    *   `c` = `1` (the speed of light in a vacuum)\n\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + (v * (1/n)) / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n\n    `u = n * (v + 1/n) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n*v + 1) / (n + v)`\n\n    Rearranging the terms in the numerator gives:\n\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
