    "### Analysis of the Reaction and Stereochemistry\n\n1.  **Reactants**: The problem describes a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   **Dienophile**: A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to its anhydride. The NMR data (¹H: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene**: **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n\n2.  **The Diels-Alder Reaction**: This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction that forms a bicyclic product. The reaction between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride will produce a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n\n3.  **Stereoisomers (*Endo* and *Exo* Products)**: When a cyclic diene reacts with a dienophile, two diastereomeric products can be formed: the *endo* and the *exo* adducts.\n    *   The *endo* product is generally the major product because it is formed faster (it is the kinetic product). This preference is due to \"secondary orbital interactions\" between the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile and the developing pi-system of the diene in the transition state.\n    *   The *exo* product is typically the minor product. It is often more stable thermodynamically but forms more slowly.\n\n4.  **Product Structures**:\n    *   The reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene skeleton.\n    *   A CH₂ group from the diene forms the C7 bridge.\n    *   Two methyl groups are at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4).\n    *   Two methyl groups are on the newly formed double bond (C2 and C3).\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused at positions C5 and C6, with a proton at each of these positions.\n    *   ***Endo* Product (Major)**: The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) the C7 bridge. The two protons on the anhydride portion (H₅ and H₆) are oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge and are held underneath the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   ***Exo* Product (Minor)**: The anhydride ring is *anti* to the C7 bridge. The protons H₅ and H₆ are oriented *syn* to the C7 bridge.\n\n### NMR Analysis and NOESY Spectroscopy\n\n**NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** is an NMR technique that detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically less than 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected through bonds. A cross-peak between two signals indicates spatial proximity.\n\nWe can distinguish between the *endo* and *exo* products by looking for a NOESY cross-peak that is present in one isomer but absent in the other.\n\n1.  **Proton Signal Assignments**: Based on typical chemical shifts for such structures:\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet)**: These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4).\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**: These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2 and C3). Vinylic methyl groups are more deshielded than saturated ones.\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)**: These are the two equivalent protons (H₅ and H₆) on the anhydride part of the structure. Their proximity to the carbonyl groups causes a significant downfield shift.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)**: This signal corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge.\n\n2.  **Spatial Relationships and NOESY Cross-Peaks**:\n    *   **In the Major (*Endo*) Product**: The H₅ and H₆ protons (~3.5 ppm) are located directly under the C2=C3 double bond. This places them very close to the vinylic methyl groups at C2 and C3 (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   **In the Minor (*Exo*) Product**: The H₅ and H₆ protons (~3.5 ppm) are pointed towards the C7 bridge. They are far from the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm), so the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak. Instead, a cross-peak might be observed between the H₅/H₆ protons and the protons on the C7 bridge (~1.5 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nThe problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. Based on the stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder reaction, the major product is the *endo* isomer. The unique spatial interaction in the *endo* isomer is between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups.\n\nThis corresponds to a NOESY cross-peak connecting:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (anhydride protons).\n*   The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (vinylic methyl protons).\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
