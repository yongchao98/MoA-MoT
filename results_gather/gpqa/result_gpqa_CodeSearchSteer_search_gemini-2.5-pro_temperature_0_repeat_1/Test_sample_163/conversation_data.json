    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics for binary star systems. The information provided—eclipses, orbital periods, and radial velocity amplitudes—is key to solving this problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Binary Systems\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, where we can observe the spectral lines from both stars, the total mass of the system (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M = m₁ + m₂) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂).\n\nThe fact that both systems exhibit eclipses is crucial. It implies that their orbital planes are viewed nearly edge-on from our line of sight. This means the inclination angle *i* is approximately 90°, and therefore, sin(*i*) is approximately 1. This simplifies the mass calculation significantly.\n\nThe formula for the total mass of an eclipsing binary system, assuming circular orbits (which is consistent with the sinusoidal radial velocity variations), is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n\nM₁ + M₂ = [ P / (2πG) ] * (K₁ + K₂ )³\n\nWhere:\n*   M₁ and M₂ are the masses of the two stars.\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   K₁ and K₂ are the amplitudes of the radial velocities.\n\n### Calculating the Mass Ratio\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_sys1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_sys2).\n\nLet's denote the parameters for each system:\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₁ₐ, K₁ₑ) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   Sum of velocities (K_total1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₂ₐ, K₂ₑ) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   Sum of velocities (K_total2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nThe total mass for each system is proportional to its period multiplied by the cube of the sum of its velocity amplitudes:\n\nM_sys ∝ P * (K_total)³\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio of the masses of the two systems:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = [ P₁ * (K_total1)³ ] / [ P₂ * (K_total2)³ ]\n\nPlugging in the values (we can use years for the period and km/s for velocity, as the units will cancel out in the ratio):\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\n\nFirst, simplify the fraction of the velocities:\n15 / 25 = 3 / 5 = 0.6\n\nNow, substitute this back into the equation:\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (0.6)³\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * 0.216\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432\n\nThis result indicates that the mass of system_1 is approximately 0.432 times the mass of system_2. This value is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
