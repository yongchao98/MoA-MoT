    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we need to calculate the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nUsing the given overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for each species, we get:\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe term [Co²⁺] cancels out from the numerator and the denominator:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the denominator (D):\nD = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNext, let's calculate the value of the numerator (N), which corresponds to the dithiocyanato complex:\nN = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n\nNow, we can find the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = N / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
