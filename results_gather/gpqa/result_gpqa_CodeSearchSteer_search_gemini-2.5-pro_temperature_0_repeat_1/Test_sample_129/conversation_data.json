    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of large neutral hydrogen clouds that absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman-alpha wavelength, allowing for their detection by optical ground-based telescopes, a few key factors must be considered.\n\nFirst, the Lyman-alpha line of hydrogen has a specific rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength falls within the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Earth's atmosphere is largely opaque to UV radiation, meaning it absorbs most of this light before it can reach the ground.\n\nSecond, optical ground-based telescopes are designed to observe the visible light that can penetrate the atmosphere. This \"optical window\" typically starts at a wavelength of about 3800 to 4000 Å. For a spectral line to be detectable by these telescopes, it must be shifted from its original wavelength into this visible range.\n\nThis shift in wavelength is caused by the expansion of the universe and is quantified by redshift (z). The formula that relates the rest wavelength (λ_rest), the observed wavelength (λ_observed), and redshift is:\n\nλ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)\n\nTo find the minimum redshift, we can set the observed wavelength to the lower limit of the optical window, which we'll conservatively take as 4000 Å.\n\nUsing the formula:\n*   λ_rest = 1216 Å\n*   λ_observed = 4000 Å\n\nWe can solve for z:\n4000 = 1216 * (1 + z)\n1 + z = 4000 / 1216\n1 + z ≈ 3.29\nz ≈ 2.29\n\nThis calculated redshift of approximately 2.29 is the minimum required to shift the 1216 Å Lyman-alpha line into the visible spectrum detectable from the ground. Comparing this value to the given options:\n\n*   A) 2.4\n*   B) 1.9\n*   C) 3\n*   D) 1.2\n\nA redshift of 1.9 would only shift the line to about 3526 Å, which is still in the UV range and would be blocked by the atmosphere. A redshift of 2.4 would shift the line to approximately 4134 Å, which is clearly within the observable optical range. While higher redshifts like 3.0 would also be detectable, the question asks for the lower limit. Therefore, a redshift of at least ~2.3 is needed, making 2.4 the most appropriate answer among the choices. Some ground-based observations of the Lyman-alpha forest begin at redshifts of around z ≳ 2.5.\n\n<<<A>>>"
