    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the energy levels of a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well and then apply the Pauli exclusion principle for multiple identical spin-1/2 particles.\n\n### Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nThe energy for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is quantized and given by the formula:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the energy of the n-th level is:\nE_n = n²E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n### System of Four Identical Spin-1/2 Particles\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 fermions, which means they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by its spatial quantum number (n) and its spin quantum number (m_s). For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin can be either up (+1/2) or down (-1/2). Consequently, each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Ground State Energy\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles:\n*   **n = 1 level:** We can place two particles in this level (one with spin up, one with spin down). The energy contributed by these two particles is 2 × E₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   **n = 2 level:** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one with spin up, one with spin down). The energy from these particles is 2 × E₂ = 2 × (2²E) = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n### First Excited State Energy\n\nTo obtain the first excited state, we move one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state configuration to the next available unoccupied energy level. This corresponds to the smallest possible energy increase.\n*   The ground state configuration has particles in the n=1 and n=2 levels.\n*   We excite one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy for the first excited state is:\nE_first_excited = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\nE_first_excited = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E)\nE_first_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n### Second Excited State Energy\n\nFor the second excited state, we need to find the next possible energy configuration that is higher than the first excited state. We can consider a few possibilities for excitation from the ground state (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2):\n1.  Move one particle from n=2 to n=4: The configuration would be (2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4).\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n2.  Move both particles from n=2 to n=3: The configuration would be (2 in n=1, 2 in n=3).\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n3.  Move one particle from n=1 to n=3: The configuration would be (1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3).\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\nComparing the energies of these possible excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest is the first excited state (15E), and the next lowest is the second excited state.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<B>>>"
