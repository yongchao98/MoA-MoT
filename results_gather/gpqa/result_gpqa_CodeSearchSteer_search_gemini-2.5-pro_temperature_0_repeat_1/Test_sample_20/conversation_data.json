    "### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a phenomenon where a single chemical compound tends to exist in two or more interconvertible structures that are different in terms of the relative position of one atomic nucleus, which is generally hydrogen. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it typically must have an α-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** The structure of p-benzoquinone consists of a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. There are no α-hydrogens on saturated carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups. While there are hydrogens on the double-bonded carbons (vinylic hydrogens), their removal to form a tautomer is energetically unfavorable. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) each have α-hydrogens. This allows it to undergo keto-enol tautomerism to form its enol tautomer, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is particularly stable because it is aromatic.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The IUPAC name for this compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). This makes the second carbon a chiral center, and thus, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The IUPAC name for this compound is dimethyl (E)-but-2-enedioate. It is the trans-isomer of a butenedioate ester. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which means it is achiral. Since it is not chiral, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining the findings from both parts, the correct option is:\nA = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\n<<<B>>>"
