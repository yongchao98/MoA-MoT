    "The analysis of the provided 1H NMR data leads to the identification of the unknown compound. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the spectral data:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal is a singlet, meaning the three equivalent protons are not coupled to any neighboring protons. The chemical shift is characteristic of the methyl group in an acetate (CH₃COO-), which is present in all four possible compounds.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal is a doublet, indicating that these three equivalent protons are coupled to a single proton. This corresponds to a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond, which is split by the adjacent vinyl proton.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal represents a single proton that is split into a doublet of quartets. The doublet arises from coupling to one adjacent proton, and the quartet arises from coupling to three adjacent protons. This pattern fits a vinyl proton that is coupled to another vinyl proton and a methyl group.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is for a single proton split into a doublet by a single neighboring proton. The key piece of information here is the coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. For protons on a double bond (vinylic protons), a large coupling constant (typically 11-18 Hz) is indicative of a *trans* configuration. A *cis* configuration would show a smaller coupling constant (typically 5-10 Hz). This large J value allows for the elimination of the *cis* isomers.\n\nBased on this information, the structure must have a *trans* double bond, eliminating Cis-propenyl acetate and Cis-butenyl acetate.\n\nNow, let's assemble the remaining fragments for Trans-propenyl acetate (CH₃-CH=CH-O-CO-CH₃):\n*   The acetate methyl group (CH₃COO-) accounts for the singlet at 2.1 ppm.\n*   The methyl group on the double bond (CH₃-CH=) accounts for the doublet at 1.6 ppm.\n*   The proton on the same carbon as this methyl group (=CH-) is split by the other vinyl proton and the three methyl protons, resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq) at 5.5 ppm.\n*   The remaining vinyl proton (=CH-O) is adjacent to the oxygen, which deshields it, shifting it downfield to 7.0 ppm. It is split only by the other vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d). The coupling constant of 16.0 Hz confirms the *trans* relationship.\n\nThis structure perfectly matches all the provided 1H NMR data. A butenyl acetate structure would have a different number of signals and/or different splitting patterns. For example, trans-but-2-enyl acetate (CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-O-CO-CH₃) would have a doublet for the CH₂ group, which is not observed.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
