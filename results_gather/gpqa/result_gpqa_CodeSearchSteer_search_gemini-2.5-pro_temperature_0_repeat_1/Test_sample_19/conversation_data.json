    "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations is a simplifying assumption that allows the complex interaction between a probe and a nucleus to be treated as a collection of interactions with individual, quasi-free nucleons. This approximation is valid under specific conditions. Analyzing the given options:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** This is a fundamental tenet of the impulse approximation. The total interaction is treated as the sum of interactions with each nucleon separately. This is supported by sources that describe the process as a \"superposition of two-body interactions\" or the scattering from \"individual nucleons acting independently\".\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** This assumption implies that the incoming probe interacts with a single nucleon without significant prior or subsequent interactions with other nucleons in the nucleus. This is also described as the probe not being affected by the medium. If the probe were to scatter multiple times, the approximation would break down.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic:** This assumption relates to the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation, however, primarily deals with the behavior of the nucleon as a whole within the nucleus during the interaction. While the internal structure of nucleons is a key topic in nuclear physics, its relativistic or non-relativistic nature is not a foundational assumption for the impulse approximation itself.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** The core idea of the impulse approximation is that the interaction happens over such a short timescale that the impulse from the probe is far greater than any impulse from the binding forces holding the nucleon within the nucleus. Therefore, during the interaction, the nucleon can be treated as if it were free. More precisely, the binding forces are considered to not strongly depend on the nucleonic variables during the brief interaction.\n\nBased on this analysis, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
