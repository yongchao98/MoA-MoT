    "Based on the chemical reactions provided, the identities of the substances are deduced as follows:\n\n*   **A**: I₂ (Iodine)\n*   **B**: Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n*   **C**: I₂Cl₆ (Iodine trichloride dimer), a bright yellow/red solid.\n*   **D**: CO (Carbon monoxide)\n*   **E**: COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n*   **F**: HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n*   **G**: HIO₃ (Iodic acid)\n*   **H**: COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n\nHere is the breakdown of the reactions:\n\n*   **Reaction 1**: I₂(s) + 3Cl₂(g) → I₂Cl₆(s). While the problem states 8 equivalents of gas B, the other reactions strongly support this chemical scheme. The stoichiometry in the riddle is likely a red herring or an error. I₂Cl₆ is a bright yellow solid that can appear reddish upon exposure to light.\n*   **Reaction 2**: I₂Cl₆(s) + 2CO(g) → 2COCl₂(g) + I₂(s). This reaction produces product E, phosgene (COCl₂), which is known to be extremely hazardous.\n*   **Reaction 3**: The hydrolysis of iodine trichloride (the monomer of C) produces iodine, hydrochloric acid, and iodic acid (5ICl₃ + 9H₂O → 15HCl + I₂ + 3HIO₃). This matches the description of reforming solid A (I₂) and producing a strong acid F (HCl) and a weaker acid G (HIO₃).\n*   **Reaction 4**: CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(g). This 1:1 reaction between gas D (CO) and gas B (Cl₂) forms phosgene (H), which is used as a solvent and reagent in industrial chemistry.\n\nThe extremely hazardous product E is identified as phosgene (COCl₂). To determine its molecular symmetry group, we must look at its structure. Phosgene has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms, resulting in a trigonal planar molecular geometry.\n\nThe symmetry elements of the COCl₂ molecule are:\n*   A C₂ rotational axis that passes through the C=O bond.\n*   Two perpendicular mirror planes (σᵥ) that contain the C₂ axis. One is the plane of the molecule itself, and the other is perpendicular to it.\n\nA molecule with a C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n<<<A>>>"
