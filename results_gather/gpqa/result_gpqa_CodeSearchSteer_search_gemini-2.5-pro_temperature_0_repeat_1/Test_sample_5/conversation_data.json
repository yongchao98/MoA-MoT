    "To determine the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to analyze the potential in a more familiar form. The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nIt is often easier to solve the Schrödinger equation when the potential is separable in Cartesian coordinates (x, y). We can convert the potential using the relationships x = r cos(θ) and r² = x² + y².\n\nSubstituting these into the potential expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(x²)\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThis potential is recognizable as the sum of two independent one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator potentials, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. This is known as a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The potential can be written as:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 (4k)x² + 1/2 (k)y²\n\nHere, the effective spring constant for the x-direction is k_x = 4k, and for the y-direction is k_y = k.\n\nFor a separable potential, the total energy E is the sum of the energies from the independent motions in the x and y directions, E = E_x + E_y. The energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form 1/2 k'q² are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency ω = sqrt(k'/m).\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction:\nThe angular frequency is ω_x = sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m).\nThe energy eigenvalues are E_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m).\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction:\nThe angular frequency is ω_y = sqrt(k_y / m) = sqrt(k / m).\nThe energy eigenvalues are E_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m).\n\nThe total energy spectrum is the sum of these two energies:\nE = E_x + E_y\nE = (n_x + 1/2) * 2ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
