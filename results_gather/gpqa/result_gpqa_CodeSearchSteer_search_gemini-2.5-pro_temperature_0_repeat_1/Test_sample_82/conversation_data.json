    "The initial calculations seem correct. The search results confirm the methodologies used:\n\n1.  **pH at 25% Titration**: This point is in the buffer region of the titration. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), is the correct formula to use. At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), meaning the ratio of [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75 or 1/3. The pKa is calculated as -log(Ka).\n\n2.  **pH at the Equivalence Point**: At this point, all the weak acid has been converted to its conjugate base. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base (acetate) in water, which produces OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic (pH > 7). The calculation involves:\n    *   Finding the concentration of the conjugate base.\n    *   Calculating Kb from Ka using the equation Kb = Kw / Ka.\n    *   Setting up the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction (Kb = [OH⁻]² / [A⁻]) to find the [OH⁻].\n    *   Calculating pOH from [OH⁻] and then finding the pH (pH = 14 - pOH). This entire process is confirmed by the titration guides.\n\nThe value for Ka of acetic acid is consistently cited as 1.8 x 10⁻⁵. The problem provides 1.85 x 10⁻⁵, which I have used.\n\nThe steps and formulas I've used are validated by the search results. I will proceed with the final answer based on my calculations.\n\n**Summary of Calculations:**\n*   **Diluted Acetic Acid Concentration:** (20.00 cm³ * 0.05 M) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n*   **pKa:** -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **pH at 25% Titration:** pH = pKa + log(25/75) = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.26\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid:** 0.025 M * 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **Volume of NaOH at Equivalence:** 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³\n*   **Total Volume at Equivalence:** 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of Acetate [A⁻] at Equivalence:** 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Kb for Acetate:** (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **[OH⁻] at Equivalence:** √([A⁻] * Kb) = √(0.02 * 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **pOH at Equivalence:** -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   **pH at Equivalence:** 14 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This corresponds to option B.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 3.17; 6.73\nB) 4.26; 8.52\nC) 4.57; 6.92\nD) 4.73; 7.00\n\nMy calculated values match option B perfectly.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to present the final answer.\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial Molarity (M₁) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the final molarity (M₂) is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This creates a buffer solution where the ratio of [A⁻] to [HA] is 25:75 or 1:3.\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH of a buffer solution.\n*   pH = pKa + log ([A⁻]/[HA])\n\nFirst, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\nNow, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n*   pH = 4.733 + log(25/75) = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n*   The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to sodium acetate. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (A⁻), a weak base.\n\nFirst, determine the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n*   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol.\n*   Volume of NaOH added = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   Total volume of the solution = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\nNext, calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻] resulting from the hydrolysis of acetate:\n*   The reaction is: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate. Kb = Kw / Ka\n*   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   The equilibrium expression is Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻]. Assuming [HA] ≈ [OH⁻] and [A⁻] remains 0.02 M, we get:\n    Kb ≈ [OH⁻]² / [A⁻]\n*   [OH⁻]² = Kb × [A⁻] = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n*   [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nFinally, calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n*   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n*   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 and pH ≈ 8.52. This matches option B.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>Here is the step-by-step calculation for the pH at the two specified points of the titration.\n\n### 1. Concentration of Acetic Acid after Dilution\n\nFirst, we calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid solution after being diluted with water.\n*   **Initial Concentration (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n\nUsing the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the final concentration (M₂) is:\nM₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt the point of 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). The remaining 75% is still acetic acid. This mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base forms a buffer solution.\n\nTo find the pH of this buffer, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n**pH = pKa + log ([A⁻]/[HA])**\n\nFirst, we calculate the pKa from the given acid dissociation constant (Ka = 1.85x10⁻⁵):\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\nAt 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid, [A⁻]/[HA], is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3. Now, we can calculate the pH:\n*   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n*   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n*   pH ≈ 4.256\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate. The pH of the solution is now determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (A⁻), which is a weak base and reacts with water to produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n\n**Step 1: Find the concentration of the acetate ion.**\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   To reach the equivalence point, an equal number of moles of NaOH is required: 0.001 mol.\n*   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH added = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Total volume of the solution at the equivalence point = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻].**\n*   The hydrolysis reaction is: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻.\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which is found using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) and the Ka of acetic acid: Kb = Kw / Ka.\n*   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   Using the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis, Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻], which simplifies to Kb ≈ [OH⁻]² / [A⁻], we can solve for [OH⁻].\n*   [OH⁻]² = Kb × [A⁻] = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹.\n*   [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH.**\n*   First, find the pOH: pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n*   Then, find the pH: pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point ≈ **8.52**\n\nThese values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
