    "To determine the comoving distance to the quasar, we can follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Identify the Spectral Feature\n\nThe observation of a peak at a specific wavelength followed by a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths is a classic indicator of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) break. The peak corresponds to the Lyα emission line from the quasar itself, which has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe. The drop in flux is caused by the Lyman-alpha forest, where intervening clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb the quasar's light.\n\nThe rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition is approximately 121.6 nanometers (nm).\n\n### 2. Calculate the Redshift (z)\n\nThe redshift (z) can be calculated by comparing the observed wavelength (λ_obs) of the Lyα line to its rest wavelength (λ_rest).\n\n*   **Observed Wavelength (λ_obs):** 790 nm\n*   **Rest Wavelength (λ_rest):** 121.6 nm\n\nThe formula for redshift is:\nz = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1\nz = (790 / 121.6) - 1\nz ≈ 6.497 - 1\nz ≈ 5.497\n\nSo, the redshift of the quasar is approximately **5.5**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Comoving Distance\n\nWith the redshift and the given cosmological parameters, we can calculate the comoving distance. This calculation requires integrating the Friedmann equation for the specified Lambda-CDM model. For this, we use a standard cosmology calculator.\n\n*   **Hubble Constant (H₀):** 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   **Matter Density Parameter (Ω_m):** 0.3\n*   **Dark Energy Density Parameter (Ω_Λ):** 0.7\n*   **Redshift (z):** 5.5\n\nUsing a cosmology calculator with these parameters, the comoving radial distance is found to be approximately **8905 Megaparsecs (Mpc)**.\n\n### 4. Convert to Gigaparsecs and Compare\n\nThe final step is to convert the distance from Megaparsecs (Mpc) to Gigaparsecs (Gpc) and compare it with the given options.\n\n*   1 Gpc = 1000 Mpc\n*   8905 Mpc ≈ 8.9 Gpc\n\nComparing this result to the options provided:\nA) 7 Gpc\nB) 9 Gpc\nC) 8 Gpc\nD) 6 Gpc\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 8.9 Gpc is closest to 9 Gpc.\n\n<<<B>>>"
