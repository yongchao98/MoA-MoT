    "The derivation performed in the thought process is based on the principle of conservation of energy, which is a fundamental concept in physics. The total energy of the system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy of the harmonic oscillator.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Total energy at maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n    At the point of maximum displacement, the mass is momentarily at rest (v = 0). Its relativistic energy is just its rest energy, E = mc². The potential energy stored in the spring is at its maximum, U = (1/2)kA². Therefore, the total energy of the system is:\n    E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA²\n\n2.  **Total energy at the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero (U = 0). The mass is moving at its maximum speed, v_max. Its relativistic energy is E = γ_max * mc², where the Lorentz factor γ_max is 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²). The total energy of the system is:\n    E_total = γ_max * mc²\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    By equating the total energy at these two points, we get:\n    mc² + (1/2)kA² = γ_max * mc²\n\n4.  **Solve for v_max:**\n    First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, γ_max:\n    γ_max = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)\n\n    Next, we substitute the definition of γ_max:\n    1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)\n\n    Now, we solve for v_max. Squaring both sides gives:\n    1 / (1 - v_max²/c²) = (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²\n\n    Inverting both sides:\n    1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²\n\n    Rearranging the terms to isolate v_max²/c²:\n    v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²\n\n    Finally, taking the square root and multiplying by c yields the maximum speed:\n    v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²)\n\nThis result matches option A. As a check, in the non-relativistic limit where the speed of light c is considered to be infinitely large, this equation correctly reduces to the classical result v_max = sqrt(kA²/m).\n\n<<<A>>>"
