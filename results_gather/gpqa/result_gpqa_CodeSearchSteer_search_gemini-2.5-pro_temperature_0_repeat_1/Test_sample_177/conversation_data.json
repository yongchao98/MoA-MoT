    "To determine the mass dimension of Îº and the renormalizability of the theory, we must analyze the dimensions of each component of the interaction Lagrangian \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}\\) in natural units (where \\(\\hbar = c = 1\\)).\n\n1.  **Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density (\\(\\mathcal{L}\\))**: The action, \\(S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}\\), must be dimensionless. Since the spacetime volume element \\(d^4x\\) has a mass dimension of \\([M]^{-4}\\), the Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) must have a mass dimension of \\([M]^4\\).\n\n2.  **Mass Dimension of the Fermion Field (\\(\\psi\\))**: The kinetic term for a fermion field in the Dirac Lagrangian is \\(\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi\\). For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, and knowing the derivative \\(\\partial_\\mu\\) has a mass dimension of 1, the dimension of the fermion field \\(\\psi\\) must be \\([M]^{3/2}\\).\n    *   \\([\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\psi] + [\\partial_\\mu] = 4\\)\n    *   \\(2[\\psi] + 1 = 4 \\implies [\\psi] = 3/2\\)\n    *   Therefore, \\([\\psi] = [\\bar{\\psi}] = 3/2\\).\n\n3.  **Mass Dimension of the Field Strength Tensor (\\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\))**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is \\(-\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}\\). For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, the field strength tensor \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) must have a mass dimension of \\([M]^2\\).\n    *   \\(2[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4 \\implies [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 2\\)\n\n4.  **Mass Dimension of \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\)**: The term \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]\\) is constructed from the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Therefore, \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is also dimensionless.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Mass Dimension of \\(\\kappa\\)**: Now we can determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \\(\\kappa\\) by ensuring the total dimension of \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}\\) is 4.\n    *   \\([\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa][\\bar{\\psi}][\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}][\\psi][F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4\\)\n    *   \\([\\kappa] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 4\\)\n    *   \\([\\kappa] + 3 + 2 = 4\\)\n    *   \\([\\kappa] + 5 = 4\\)\n    *   \\([\\kappa] = -1\\)\n\n6.  **Renormalizability of the Theory**: A theory is generally considered renormalizable by power counting if the mass dimensions of all its coupling constants are greater than or equal to zero. If a theory contains a coupling constant with a negative mass dimension, it is non-renormalizable. This is because higher-order corrections in perturbation theory would require an infinite number of counterterms to cancel all the divergences.\n    *   Since \\([\\kappa] = -1\\), which is negative, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nCombining these findings, the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
