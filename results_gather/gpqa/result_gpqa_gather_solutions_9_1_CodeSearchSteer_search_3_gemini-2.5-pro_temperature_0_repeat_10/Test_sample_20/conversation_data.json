An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Since there are **no alpha-hydrogens**, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons to the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   Each of these alpha-carbons has **two alpha-hydrogens**.\n    *   Due to the presence of these alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism to form its enol, which is the highly stable aromatic compound phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A common feature of a chiral molecule is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C-2). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**.\n    *   The molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   The structure is the trans-isomer of an alkene with a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃) on each of the double-bonded carbons: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral.\n    *   Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more readily interconvertible structures that differ in the relative position of at least one atomic nucleus, typically a hydrogen atom. A common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a ring structure with two carbonyl (C=O) groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses three keto groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms located between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) each have two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound, which makes it particularly stable. The equilibrium between the keto and enol forms exists, confirming that it shows tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of a chiral molecule is the presence of a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The IUPAC name for this compound indicates a propanoate chain with a hydroxyl (-OH) group on the second carbon. Let's examine the groups attached to the second carbon atom:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methyl ester group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since all four groups are different, the second carbon is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a trans configuration around the carbon-carbon double bond. The structure is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It does not have a chiral center. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **Task:** Identify two specific compounds from a given list based on their chemical properties.\n    *   **Property 1 (Compound A):** Must *not* show tautomerism. The candidates are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n    *   **Property 2 (Compound B):** Must show optical isomerism. The candidates are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n    *   **Output:** Select the correct option (A, B, C, or D) that correctly identifies both compounds A and B. The final answer should be presented in a Python code block that prints the result.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Definition:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers (tautomers) can readily interconvert, most commonly through the migration of a proton and a shift of a double bond. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Key Requirement for Keto-Enol Tautomerism:** The molecule must possess an \"alpha-hydrogen\" – a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n    *   **Candidate 1: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.** Its structure is a 6-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups. These are sp³ hybridized carbons, and they are alpha-carbons to two carbonyl groups each. They have alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is aromatic and very stable. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Candidate 2: Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone).** Its structure is a 6-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). While they have hydrogen atoms, these are not the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon required for simple keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its corresponding \"enol\" (hydroquinone) is a reduction (a redox reaction), not a simple isomerization (tautomerism). Thus, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Definition:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Key Requirement:** The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Candidate 1: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the central carbon (carbon-2). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n    *   **Candidate 2: Dimethyl fumarate.** This is the trans-isomer of an alkene. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It has a center of symmetry and is achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) = benzoquinone\n    *   Compound B (optical isomerism) = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n    *   Matching this pair with the given options:\n        *   A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  <- This is a match.\n        *   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n        *   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n        *   D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n    *   The correct option is A.\n\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:**\n    *   The code will programmatically determine the correct choice based on the conclusions from the analysis.\n    *   It will define the correct compound for each property.\n    *   It will then check the list of options to find the one that matches the correct compounds for both A and B.\n    *   Finally, it will print the letter of the correct option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the isomerism problem by identifying the correct compounds\n    for properties A and B and then selecting the corresponding multiple-choice option.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Part A: Identify the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n    # - Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha-hydrogens on sp3 carbons and readily tautomerizes to the stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol.\n    # - Benzoquinone's conversion to hydroquinone is a redox reaction, not tautomerism.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound with a carbonyl group (keto form) to exhibit this type of tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the alpha-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen. The presence of an alpha-hydrogen on an sp³ hybridized carbon allows for the formation of an enol tautomer.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Benzoquinone.**\n    *   The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at positions 1 and 4, and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are all sp² hybridized as they are part of the ring's double bonds. They do have hydrogen atoms attached, but these are vinylic hydrogens.\n    *   Crucially, for standard keto-enol tautomerism, the alpha-carbon needs to be sp³ hybridized to allow for the formation of a new double bond without disrupting the existing framework in an unstable way. Since benzoquinone lacks sp³ hybridized alpha-carbons with alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are sp³ hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it can tautomerize to form phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and thus very stable enol form.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism (B)**\n\n*   **Step 1: Understand Optical Isomerism.**\n    Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze Dimethyl fumarate.**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid.\n    *   Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond.\n    *   It does not contain any chiral centers (no carbon is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion (located at the midpoint of the C=C bond), which makes it achiral.\n    *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\n\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Analyze Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where molecules can interconvert by a chemical reaction, most commonly the migration of a proton. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. They are sp³ hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are highly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerization. It converts to its enol form, benzene-1,3,5-triol (also known as phloroglucinol). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). While these carbons have hydrogen atoms, they are not the typical labile alpha-hydrogens found on sp³ carbons that participate in keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** For benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to form its corresponding phenol-like structure (hydroquinone, C₆H₆O₂), it would need to gain two hydrogen atoms. This is a change in the molecular formula, which means the reaction is a reduction, not an isomerization (tautomerism).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Analyze Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). The four groups attached to it are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of an ester with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. It has a center of symmetry (inversion center) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule that possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Result for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more interconvertible forms that differ in the position of a proton and a double bond. Keto-enol tautomerism is a common type, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** The structure of 1,4-benzoquinone consists of a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone (C=O) groups at opposite ends. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Since benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups are CH₂ groups, meaning they have alpha-hydrogens. These alpha-hydrogens can move, allowing the compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable due to the formation of an aromatic ring.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center – a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since this carbon is a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical isomerism (it has D and L enantiomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of an alkene with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C=C double bond. Due to this symmetry, it is achiral and does not have a non-superimposable mirror image. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct option:\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more readily interconvertible structures that differ in the relative position of at least one atom, commonly a hydrogen atom. Keto-enol tautomerism is a common type that occurs in carbonyl compounds, but it requires the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):** In the structure of benzoquinone, the carbon atoms adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of carbon-carbon double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has alpha-hydrogens on the carbons situated between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6). The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows it to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound, which makes it particularly stable. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does exhibit tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon has four different substituents, it is a chiral center.

A key requirement for a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen.

For the compounds in question, we are concerned with **keto-enol tautomerism**. The essential requirement for a ketone or aldehyde to undergo this type of tautomerism is the presence of at least one **alpha-hydrogen**—a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom directly adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure of benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at opposite ends and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of these double bonds. Consequently, these alpha-carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, **benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are situated between carbonyl groups, making them alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is a -CH₂- group, possessing two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the molecule to readily tautomerize to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism exhibited by **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature that confers chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is `CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃`. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the hydroxyl group). This carbon is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and **will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is `CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The molecule possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Achiral molecules do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two isomers that can be interconverted, most commonly by the migration of a proton. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one **alpha-hydrogen**. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\nLet's analyze the two given compounds:\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4).\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are the carbons involved in the C=C double bonds (at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are each bonded to another carbon (in the ring) and a hydrogen. Wait, let me re-examine the structure of p-benzoquinone. The formula is C6H4O2. The carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 are sp2 hybridized and are part of C=C double bonds. Each of these carbons is bonded to one hydrogen atom. So, there are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   However, for tautomerization to occur, the enol form must be reasonably stable. The enol form of benzoquinone would be hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene). While hydroquinone is a very stable aromatic compound, the conversion from benzoquinone to hydroquinone is a **reduction** (gain of two electrons and two protons), not a simple tautomeric shift. Tautomerism is an isomerization equilibrium (same molecular formula). Benzoquinone (C6H4O2) and hydroquinone (C6H6O2) have different molecular formulas. Therefore, this is not tautomerism. The key point is that the alpha-hydrogens are on sp2 carbons, and removing one to form an enol would disrupt the conjugated system in a way that is not a typical keto-enol tautomerization. The system is already conjugated. The compound is considered non-tautomeric.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered saturated ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the alpha-carbons. They are located between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons (CH2 groups) has two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because the resulting negative charge after deprotonation can be delocalized over two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Due to the presence of these highly acidic alpha-hydrogens, this compound readily undergoes tautomerization to form its enol isomer, **phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene)**. This enol form is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable, so the equilibrium heavily favors the enol form.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (A):** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism (B)**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** is shown by **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   A common source of chirality is the presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\nLet's analyze the two given compounds:\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two -COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. It also has a center of inversion.\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it cannot show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (B):** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this with the options provided:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers.

The carbon atoms that are part of the carbonyl groups (C=O) are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. The other four carbon atoms are part of C=C double bonds and are sp2 hybridized. These carbons have vinylic hydrogens, not the required α-hydrogens on an sp3 hybridized carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are situated between carbonyl groups and possess acidic α-hydrogens. The presence of these α-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is aromatic and particularly stable, meaning the equilibrium favors the enol form.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (D and L forms).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, which is the trans isomer of an alkene. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers. While it exhibits geometric (cis-trans) isomerism, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more interconvertible forms that differ in the position of a proton and a double bond.

The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons, and each is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens allow the compound to undergo tautomerism. In fact, it readily converts to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic compound, which is a much more stable state than the non-aromatic trione form.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images.

It is a trans-isomer. The molecule does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups; thus, it has no chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and is achiral.

These alpha-hydrogens allow the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is particularly stable because it is aromatic, containing a planar ring with 6 π-electrons.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism**\n\n1.  **Define Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a type of isomerism where isomers can readily interconvert. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\" — a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³ hybridized and are located between two carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons has two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). They lack the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon required for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its corresponding phenol (hydroquinone) is a reduction reaction (a change in molecular formula from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂), not an isomerization. Therefore, benzoquinone does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism**\n\n1.  **Define Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C-2) is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, it does **not** show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Since there are **no alpha-hydrogens**, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.

So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more readily interconvertible structures that differ in the relative position of at least one atomic nucleus, typically a hydrogen atom. A common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a ring structure with two carbonyl (C=O) groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses three keto groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms located between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) each have two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound, which makes it particularly stable. The equilibrium between the keto and enol forms exists, confirming that it shows tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of a chiral molecule is the presence of a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The IUPAC name for this compound indicates a propanoate chain with a hydroxyl (-OH) group on the second carbon. Let's examine the groups attached to the second carbon atom:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methyl ester group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since all four groups are different, the second carbon is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a trans configuration around the carbon-carbon double bond. The structure is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It does not have a chiral center. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **Task:** Identify two specific compounds from a given list based on their chemical properties.\n    *   **Property 1 (Compound A):** Must *not* show tautomerism. The candidates are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n    *   **Property 2 (Compound B):** Must show optical isomerism.

The final answer should be presented in a Python code block that prints the result.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Definition:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers (tautomers) can readily interconvert, most commonly through the migration of a proton and a shift of a double bond. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Key Requirement for Keto-Enol Tautomerism:** The molecule must possess an \"alpha-hydrogen\" – a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n    *   **Candidate 1: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.** Its structure is a 6-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups. These are sp³ hybridized carbons, and they are alpha-carbons to two carbonyl groups each. They have alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is aromatic and very stable. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Candidate 2: Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone).** Its structure is a 6-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). While they have hydrogen atoms, these are not the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon required for simple keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its corresponding \"enol\" (hydroquinone) is a reduction (a redox reaction), not a simple isomerization (tautomerism). Thus, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Definition:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Key Requirement:** The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Candidate 1: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the central carbon (carbon-2). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n    *   **Candidate 2: Dimethyl fumarate.** This is the trans-isomer of an alkene. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It has a center of symmetry and is achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) = benzoquinone\n    *   Compound B (optical isomerism) = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n    *   Matching this pair with the given options:\n        *   A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  <- This is a match.\n        *   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n        *   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n        *   D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n    *   The correct option is A.\n\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:**\n    *   The code will programmatically determine the correct choice based on the conclusions from the analysis.\n    *   It will define the correct compound for each property.\n    *   It will then check the list of options to find the one that matches the correct compounds for both A and B.\n    *   Finally, it will print the letter of the correct option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the isomerism problem by identifying the correct compounds\n    for properties A and B and then selecting the corresponding multiple-choice option.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Part A: Identify the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n    # - Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha-hydrogens on sp3 carbons and readily tautomerizes to the stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol.\n    # - Benzoquinone's conversion to hydroquinone is a redox reaction, not tautomerism.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound with a carbonyl group (keto form) to exhibit this type of tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the alpha-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen. The presence of an alpha-hydrogen on an sp³ hybridized carbon allows for the formation of an enol tautomer.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Benzoquinone.**\n    *   The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at positions 1 and 4, and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are all sp² hybridized as they are part of the ring's double bonds. They do have hydrogen atoms attached, but these are vinylic hydrogens.\n    *   Crucially, for standard keto-enol tautomerism, the alpha-carbon needs to be sp³ hybridized to allow for the formation of a new double bond without disrupting the existing framework in an unstable way. Since benzoquinone lacks sp³ hybridized alpha-carbons with alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are sp³ hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it can tautomerize to form phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and thus very stable enol form.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism (B)**\n\n*   **Step 1: Understand Optical Isomerism.**\n    Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze Dimethyl fumarate.**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid.\n    *   Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond.\n    *   It does not contain any chiral centers (no carbon is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion (located at the midpoint of the C=C bond), which makes it achiral.\n    *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\n\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Analyze Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where molecules can interconvert by a chemical reaction, most commonly the migration of a proton. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.

These hydrogens are highly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerization. It converts to its enol form, benzene-1,3,5-triol (also known as phloroglucinol). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). While these carbons have hydrogen atoms, they are not the typical labile alpha-hydrogens found on sp³ carbons that participate in keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** For benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to form its corresponding phenol-like structure (hydroquinone, C₆H₆O₂), it would need to gain two hydrogen atoms. This is a change in the molecular formula, which means the reaction is a reduction, not an isomerization (tautomerism).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Analyze Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). The four groups attached to it are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of an ester with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. It has a center of symmetry (inversion center) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.

Keto-enol tautomerism is a common type, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** The structure of 1,4-benzoquinone consists of a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone (C=O) groups at opposite ends. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Since benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups are CH₂ groups, meaning they have alpha-hydrogens. These alpha-hydrogens can move, allowing the compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable due to the formation of an aromatic ring.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center – a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since this carbon is a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical isomerism (it has D and L enantiomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of an alkene with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C=C double bond. Due to this symmetry, it is achiral and does not have a non-superimposable mirror image. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct option:\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more readily interconvertible structures that differ in the relative position of at least one atom, commonly a hydrogen atom. Keto-enol tautomerism is a common type that occurs in carbonyl compounds, but it requires the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):** In the structure of benzoquinone, the carbon atoms adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of carbon-carbon double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached.

The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows it to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound, which makes it particularly stable. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does exhibit tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images.

Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the double bond. The molecule is symmetrical and possesses a plane of symmetry.

For the compounds in question, we are concerned with **keto-enol tautomerism**. The essential requirement for a ketone or aldehyde to undergo this type of tautomerism is the presence of at least one **alpha-hydrogen**—a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom directly adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure of benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at opposite ends and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of these double bonds. Consequently, these alpha-carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, **benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are situated between carbonyl groups, making them alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is a -CH₂- group, possessing two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the molecule to readily tautomerize to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism exhibited by **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature that confers chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is `CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃`. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the hydroxyl group). This carbon is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and **will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is `CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The molecule possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Achiral molecules do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two isomers that can be interconverted, most commonly by the migration of a proton. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one **alpha-hydrogen**. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\nLet's analyze the two given compounds:\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4).\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are the carbons involved in the C=C double bonds (at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are each bonded to another carbon (in the ring) and a hydrogen. Wait, let me re-examine the structure of p-benzoquinone. The formula is C6H4O2. The carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 are sp2 hybridized and are part of C=C double bonds. Each of these carbons is bonded to one hydrogen atom. So, there are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   However, for tautomerization to occur, the enol form must be reasonably stable. The enol form of benzoquinone would be hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene). While hydroquinone is a very stable aromatic compound, the conversion from benzoquinone to hydroquinone is a **reduction** (gain of two electrons and two protons), not a simple tautomeric shift. Tautomerism is an isomerization equilibrium (same molecular formula). Benzoquinone (C6H4O2) and hydroquinone (C6H6O2) have different molecular formulas. Therefore, this is not tautomerism. The key point is that the alpha-hydrogens are on sp2 carbons, and removing one to form an enol would disrupt the conjugated system in a way that is not a typical keto-enol tautomerization. The system is already conjugated. The compound is considered non-tautomeric.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered saturated ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the alpha-carbons. They are located between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons (CH2 groups) has two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because the resulting negative charge after deprotonation can be delocalized over two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Due to the presence of these highly acidic alpha-hydrogens, this compound readily undergoes tautomerization to form its enol isomer, **phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene)**. This enol form is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable, so the equilibrium heavily favors the enol form.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (A):** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism (B)**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** is shown by **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   A common source of chirality is the presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\nLet's analyze the two given compounds:\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two -COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. It also has a center of inversion.\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it cannot show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (B):** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this with the options provided:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. For keto-enol tautomerism to occur, a compound generally needs a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure of p-benzoquinone consists of a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms that are part of the carbonyl groups (C=O) are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. The other four carbon atoms are part of C=C double bonds and are sp2 hybridized. These carbons have vinylic hydrogens, not the required α-hydrogens on an sp3 hybridized carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are situated between carbonyl groups and possess acidic α-hydrogens. The presence of these α-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is aromatic and particularly stable, meaning the equilibrium favors the enol form.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (D and L forms).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, which is the trans isomer of an alkene. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers. While it exhibits geometric (cis-trans) isomerism, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more interconvertible forms that differ in the position of a proton and a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is typically required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Therefore, benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens to undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three carbonyl groups in a six-membered ring. The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons, and each is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens allow the compound to undergo tautomerism. In fact, it readily converts to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic compound, which is a much more stable state than the non-aromatic trione form.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of optical isomers (enantiomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is a trans-isomer. The molecule does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups; thus, it has no chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism. It does, however, exhibit geometric (cis-trans) isomerism with its counterpart, dimethyl maleate.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Answer Determination:**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a phenomenon where a single chemical compound tends to exist in two or more interconvertible structures that are different in terms of the relative position of one atomic nucleus, which is generally hydrogen. For keto-enol tautomerism to occur, a compound must have an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure of benzoquinone consists of a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons, and each is bonded to hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens allow the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is particularly stable because it is aromatic, containing a planar ring with 6 π-electrons. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists in a tautomeric equilibrium with its highly stable enol form.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon has four different substituents, it is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of optical isomers (enantiomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. It does, however, have a geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate (the *cis* isomer).\n\n**Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Answer Determination**\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
