    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n*   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The peak is very broad due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **Vinyl-hydrogens:** The presence of signals for vinyl-hydrogens (protons attached to the carbons of a double bond) confirms the existence of a C=C bond, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass = (1 x mass of C) + (2 x mass of O) + (1 x mass of H)\n    *   Mass = (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45.\n    *   This fragment peak strongly indicates that the molecule is a carboxylic acid, which readily loses its R-group to form the stable [COOH]⁺ cation.\n\n**4. Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n*   From the combined spectroscopic evidence (FTIR, MS), we have definitively identified a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. This means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A) C6H10O and B) C6H12O.\n*   The FTIR and 1H NMR data both confirm the presence of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**.\n*   Now we must decide between C) C6H10O2 and D) C6H12O2. The key is to use the concept of the **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**, which represents the total number of rings and pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n*   The DBE formula is: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)` for a molecule with Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n**5. Calculate the DBE for the remaining options:**\n*   Our molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid and another for the C=C bond. So, the correct formula must have a **DBE = 2**.\n\n*   **For option C) C6H10O2:**\n    DBE = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n    This DBE of 2 perfectly accounts for one C=O bond and one C=C bond. This is consistent with all the spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **For option D) C6H12O2:**\n    DBE = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n    This DBE of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid (e.g., in a saturated acid like hexanoic acid). It does not account for the additional C=C double bond observed in the FTIR and NMR spectra.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only chemical formula that accommodates all the experimental evidence (a carboxylic acid group and a C=C double bond) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants me to identify the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on provided spectroscopic data (FTIR, 1H NMR, Mass Spectrometry) from a list of four options.\n\n**1. Analyze the provided spectroscopic data:**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen together with the broad O-H peak, it strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to \"vinyl-hydrogens\" (hydrogens attached to the carbons of a double bond) confirms the presence of a C=C bond. This supports the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a highly diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ cation, which is formed by cleavage of the bond between the carboxylic carbon and the rest of the molecule. The mass of COOH is approximately 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45 amu.\n\n**2. Synthesize the findings:**\n\n*   From the combined data, we can confidently conclude that the unknown compound is a **carboxylic acid** (contains -COOH group) and also contains an **alkene** (a C=C double bond).\n*   Since the compound is a carboxylic acid, its chemical formula must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and B (C6H12O).\n\n**3. Differentiate between the remaining options (C and D) using the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n\n*   We know the molecule has one C=O double bond (in the acid), which counts as one degree of unsaturation.\n*   We know the molecule has one C=C double bond (the alkene), which counts as a second degree of unsaturation.\n*   Therefore, the correct formula must have a total DBE of **2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DBE for the remaining options using the formula: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for a formula CxHyOz\ndef calculate_dbe(C, H):\n    return C + 1 - (H / 2)\n\n# Option C: C6H10O2\nC_c = 6\nH_c = 10\ndbe_c = calculate_dbe(C_c, H_c)\nprint(f\"DBE for C6H10O2: {dbe_c}\")\n\n# Option D: C6H12O2\nC_d = 6\nH_d = 12\ndbe_d = calculate_dbe(C_d, H_d)\nprint(f\"DBE for C6H12O2: {dbe_d}\")\n```",

    "An unknown compound was characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down the data to identify the chemical formula.\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of an O-H stretch within a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. The broadness is a result of extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its presence, along with the broad O-H peak, confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence confirms the alkene structure suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺. (Mass of C + 2*Mass of O + Mass of H = 12 + 2*16 + 1 = 45).\n\n**Synthesizing the Information:**\n\n*   The data overwhelmingly indicates that the unknown compound has a **carboxylic acid** functional group. This means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options A) C6H10O and B) C6H12O.\n*   The data also confirms the presence of a **C=C double bond**.\n\n**Evaluating the Remaining Options using the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation represents the sum of the number of pi bonds and rings in a molecule.\n*   The C=O in the carboxylic acid accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n*   The C=C double bond accounts for a second degree of unsaturation.\n*   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a **DBE of 2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DBE for the remaining options, C and D, using the formula `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n\n*   **For C) C6H10O2:**\n    DBE = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n    This value perfectly matches the two degrees of unsaturation identified from the spectra (one C=O and one C=C).\n\n*   **For D) C6H12O2:**\n    DBE = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n    This value only accounts for the C=O of the carboxylic acid and does not account for the C=C double bond found in the FTIR and NMR spectra.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user has requested the final answer. I have completed my reasoning, which I will summarize again.\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis**: The combination of a very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch, hydrogen-bonded), a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch), and a strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ (C=C stretch) indicates the presence of both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group.\n2.  **1H NMR Analysis**: The presence of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the existence of the C=C double bond.\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis**: A fragment at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment.\n4.  **Formula Evaluation**:\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) requires the presence of two oxygen atoms, eliminating options A (C6H10O) and B (C6H12O).\n    *   We must decide between C) C6H10O2 and D) C6H12O2. We use the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for this.\n    *   The functional groups identified (one C=O and one C=C) require a DBE of 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DBE for the remaining options:\n        *   C) C6H10O2: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our required DBE.\n        *   D) C6H12O2: DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This does not match our required DBE.\n5.  **Conclusion**: All evidence points to the chemical formula C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
