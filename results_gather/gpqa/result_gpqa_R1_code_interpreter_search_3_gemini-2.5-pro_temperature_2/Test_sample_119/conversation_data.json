    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Parallax and its relation to distance:**\n    Parallax (`plx`, often denoted as `p`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. For a parallax angle `p` measured in arcseconds and distance `d` measured in parsecs, the relationship is:\n    `d = 1/p`\n\n2.  **State the fundamental assumption:**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant throughout space.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in a given volume of space:**\n    Consider a thin spherical shell of space with radius `d` and thickness `dd`.\n    The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    `dV = 4πd² dd`\n\n    The number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the density multiplied by the volume:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax:**\n    The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/dp`. To find this, we need to express `d` and `dd` in terms of `p` and `dp`.\n\n    *   From `d = 1/p`, we get `d² = (1/p)² = 1/p²`.\n    *   To find the relationship between `dd` and `dp`, we differentiate `d = 1/p` with respect to `p`:\n        `dd/dp = d/dp (p⁻¹) = -1 * p⁻² = -1/p²`\n        This gives us `dd = -dp/p²`. The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`p`) decreases. Since we are concerned with the number of stars in a range (a magnitude), we can ignore the sign and take the absolute value: `dd = dp/p²`.\n\n5.  **Substitute the parallax-based expressions back into the equation for `dN`:**\n    Now we replace `d²` and `dd` in the `dN` formula:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/p²) * (dp/p²)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / p⁴) dp`\n\n6.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide `dN` by `dp`:\n    `dN/dp = 4πρ / p⁴`\n\n7.  **Find the proportionality:**\n    Since `4`, `π`, and the stellar density `ρ` are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `dN/dp ∝ 1/p⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Let's break down the relationship between star distribution and parallax.\n\n**1. Fundamental Concepts**\n\n*   **Uniform Star Distribution:** The problem assumes that stars are spread out evenly throughout space. This means the number of stars per unit volume is a constant value. Let's call this constant density `ρ` (rho).\n*   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to a star's distance (`d`). The relationship is given by:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n    This means very distant stars have very small parallaxes, and nearby stars have larger parallaxes.\n\n**2. Reasoning and Derivation**\n\n1.  **Volume of a Shell:** Imagine a thin spherical shell of space around us. Let the shell be at a distance `d` and have a tiny thickness `dd`. The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    `dV = (Surface Area of a sphere) × (thickness)`\n    `dV = (4πd²) × dd`\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in the Shell:** Since the stars are uniformly distributed with density `ρ`, the number of stars (`dN`) in this thin volume shell is:\n    `dN = ρ × dV = ρ × (4πd²) × dd`\n\n3.  **Translate to Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`), not per unit range of distance. So, we need to express `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx`.\n\n    *   From `d = 1/plx`, we can substitute for `d²`:\n        `d² = (1/plx)² = 1/plx²`\n\n    *   To find the relationship between the thickness `dd` and a small range of parallax `d(plx)`, we differentiate the distance formula:\n        `d(d)/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ (plx)⁻¹ ]`\n        `d(d)/d(plx) = -1 × (plx)⁻² = -1/plx²`\n        This gives us `dd = -d(plx)/plx²`. The negative sign just tells us that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. For counting stars in a given range, we only care about the magnitude, so we can use `dd = d(plx)/plx²`.\n\n4.  **Combine the Expressions:** Now we substitute our parallax-based expressions for `d²` and `dd` back into the equation for the number of stars (`dN`):\n    `dN = ρ × 4π × (1/plx²) × (d(plx)/plx²) `\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) × d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Find the Final Relationship:** To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide both sides by `d(plx)`:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\nSince `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n`dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. The Core Idea\n\nThe problem links two concepts:\n*   **The volume of space:** As we look further out, the volume of space in our view increases significantly.\n*   **Parallax:** This is our way of measuring distance. Small parallax means large distance.\n\nWe need to figure out how many stars are in a \"slice\" of space defined not by distance, but by a specific range of parallax values.\n\n### 2. The Setup\n\n*   **Assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number of stars in any given volume is proportional to that volume. Let's call the constant number density of stars `ρ` (rho).\n*   **Goal:** We want to find the number of stars (`N`) per unit range of parallax (`plx`). Mathematically, this is expressed as `dN/d(plx)`. We want to see how this quantity is related to `plx`.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Number of stars at a certain distance:**\n    Let's consider a thin, spherical shell of space around the Earth.\n    *   The shell is at a distance `d`.\n    *   The shell has a very small thickness `dd`.\n    The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    `dV = (Area of sphere) × (thickness) = (4πd²) × dd`\n\n    The number of stars (`dN`) in this shell is the density (`ρ`) times this volume:\n    `dN = ρ × dV = 4πρd² dd`\n\n2.  **Converting from Distance to Parallax:**\n    The relationship between distance (`d`) and parallax (`plx`) is:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n\n    We need to replace `d` and `dd` in our equation with expressions involving `plx`.\n\n    *   **First, substitute for `d²`:**\n        `d² = (1/plx)² = 1/plx²`\n\n    *   **Next, find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`:** We do this by differentiating the distance formula with respect to `plx`.\n        `d(d)/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ (plx)⁻¹ ]`\n        `d(d)/d(plx) = -1 × (plx)⁻² = -1 / plx²`\n        This tells us that `dd = -d(plx) / plx²`.\n        The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) *increases*, parallax (`plx`) *decreases*. Since we're just counting stars in a shell, we care about the magnitude of the thickness, so we can ignore the negative sign: `dd = d(plx) / plx²`.\n\n3.  **Putting it all together:**\n    Now we substitute our new parallax-based expressions back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = 4πρ * (d²) * (dd)`\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * (d(plx)/plx²) `\n\n    Simplifying this gives:\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n4.  **Finding the Final Relationship:**\n    The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by simply dividing both sides of our final equation by `d(plx)`:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the relationship is a proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as the fourth power of the parallax. This means that while there are far more stars at great distances (small parallax), the number of stars found within a fixed parallax interval (e.g., between 0.01\" and 0.02\") drops off very steeply as you look at smaller and smaller parallax values.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the relationship between the number of stars and parallax.\n\n**1. Define the Initial Conditions**\n*   **Assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number of stars per unit volume is a constant. Let's call this constant density `ρ`.\n*   **Parallax Definition:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`d`). The formula is `d = 1/plx`.\n\n**2. Relate Number of Stars to Distance**\n*   Imagine a thin spherical shell of space with radius `d` and a small thickness `dd`.\n*   The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) times its thickness (`dd`).\n    `dV = 4πd² dd`\n*   The number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the constant density `ρ` multiplied by the volume `dV`.\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n\n**3. Convert from Distance to Parallax**\nThe goal is to find how the number of stars per unit parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) changes with parallax (`plx`). To do this, we must express all distance terms (`d` and `dd`) in terms of parallax.\n\n*   Substitute `d = 1/plx` into the equation:\n    `d² = (1/plx)² = 1/plx²`\n\n*   Find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)` by differentiating `d = 1/plx`:\n    `d(d)/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ (plx)⁻¹ ] = -1 * (plx)⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    This gives the relationship `dd = -d(plx)/plx²`. The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval, so we can write `dd = d(plx)/plx²`.\n\n**4. Combine the Expressions**\nNow substitute the expressions for `d²` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n`dN = ρ * 4π * (d²) * (dd)`\n`dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (d(plx)/plx²) `\n\nSimplify the equation by combining the `plx` terms:\n`dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n**5. Find the Final Proportionality**\nWe want to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can get this by dividing both sides of the equation by `d(plx)`:\n`dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\nSince `4`, `π`, and the stellar density `ρ` are all constants, the relationship is:\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis means the number of stars found in a fixed parallax interval (e.g., from 0.01 to 0.02 arcseconds) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Let's break down the reasoning step by step.\n\n**1. The Assumption: Uniform Star Distribution**\nThe problem starts with a crucial assumption: stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means that if you take any two equally-sized volumes of space, you expect to find the same number of stars in them, on average. Let's call this constant number of stars per unit volume the stellar density, `ρ`.\n\n**2. From Volume to Distance**\nConsider the space around us. The number of stars up to a certain distance `d` depends on the volume of the sphere with radius `d`.\nNow, let's consider a thin spherical *shell* of space at a distance `d` with a very small thickness `dd`.\n*   The surface area of this sphere is `4πd²`.\n*   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² × dd`.\n*   The number of stars (`dN`) just within this thin shell is the density times this volume: `dN = ρ × dV = 4πρd²dd`.\n\n**3. Introducing Parallax**\nParallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`d`). For parallax measured in arcseconds and distance in parsecs, the relationship is:\n`d = 1 / plx`\n\nThe question asks for the number of stars per unit range of **parallax**, not distance. So, we need to convert our equation from using `d` and `dd` to using `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n\n**4. The Conversion**\nWe need to replace `d²` and `dd` in our equation `dN = 4πρd²dd`.\n\n*   **Replacing `d²`:**\n    Since `d = 1/plx`, then `d² = (1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n\n*   **Replacing `dd`:**\n    We can find the relationship between a small change in distance (`dd`) and a small change in parallax (`d(plx)`) by differentiating the distance formula:\n    `d/d(plx) [d] = d/d(plx) [1/plx]`\n    `d/d(plx) [d] = d/d(plx) [plx⁻¹]`\n    `dd/d(plx) = -1 × plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    So, `dd = -d(plx)/plx²`. The negative sign just tells us that as distance increases, parallax decreases. When we count stars in a range, we only care about the magnitude of the range, so we can ignore the sign: `dd = d(plx)/plx²`.\n\n**5. Putting It All Together**\nNow we substitute our parallax-based expressions back into the equation for the number of stars in the shell:\n`dN = 4πρ × (d²) × (dd)`\n`dN = 4πρ × (1/plx²) × (d(plx)/plx²) `\n\nLet's simplify this by combining the `plx` terms in the denominator:\n`dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n**6. The Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is `dN/d(plx)`. To get this, we simply divide both sides of our final equation by `d(plx)`:\n`dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\nSince `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
