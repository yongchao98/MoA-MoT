    "Here's a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main goal is to calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. In stellar astronomy, \"abundance\" is typically expressed as a ratio of the number density of an element to the number density of hydrogen (e.g., n_Si/n_H). Therefore, the question asks for the value of `(n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2`.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Input Data:**\n    *   Star 1: M_1 = 1.5 M_sun, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, [Fe/H]_1 = 0.\n    *   Star 2: M_2 = 1.2 M_sun, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, [Mg/H]_2 = 0.\n    *   Sun's composition: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7.0.\n    *   Irrelevant information: The star masses (1.5 and 1.2 M_sun), the assumption of LTE, the EW method, and the absolute solar abundances are not directly needed to compute the final *ratio*, as they will cancel out. The problem is centered on interpreting the bracket notation `[X/Y]`.\n\n3.  **Define the Key Formula:** The bracket notation `[X/Y]` is the core of this problem. It's defined as:\n    `[X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y)_star - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun`\n\n4.  **Strategy for Star 1:**\n    *   We need to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, `(n_Si/n_H)_1`.\n    *   The relevant quantity is `[Si/H]_1`.\n    *   There's a useful identity relating different abundance ratios: `[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]`.\n    *   Applying this identity to our elements (Si, Fe, H): `[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`.\n    *   Substitute the given values for Star 1: `[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`.\n    *   Now, use the definition of `[Si/H]_1`: `log10(n_Si/n_H)_1 - log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun = 0.3`.\n    *   This equation relates the silicon abundance in Star 1 to the silicon abundance in the Sun.\n\n5.  **Strategy for Star 2:**\n    *   Similarly, we need to find `(n_Si/n_H)_2`.\n    *   The relevant quantity is `[Si/H]_2`.\n    *   We are given `[Mg/H]_2` and `[Mg/Si]_2`.\n    *   Apply the same identity: `[Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2`.\n    *   We need to solve for `[Si/H]_2`: `[Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2`.\n    *   Substitute the given values for Star 2: `[Si/H]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3`.\n    *   Now, use the definition of `[Si/H]_2`: `log10(n_Si/n_H)_2 - log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun = -0.3`.\n    *   This equation relates the silicon abundance in Star 2 to the silicon abundance in the Sun.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    *   The desired ratio is `R = (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2`.\n    *   It's often easier to work with logarithms. Let's find `log10(R)`.\n    *   `log10(R) = log10((n_Si/n_H)_1) - log10((n_Si/n_H)_2)`.\n    *   From our results for Star 1 and Star 2:\n        *   `log10(n_Si/n_H)_1 = 0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun`\n        *   `log10(n_Si/n_H)_2 = -0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun`\n    *   Substitute these into the equation for `log10(R)`:\n        *   `log10(R) = (0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun) - (-0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun)`\n        *   `log10(R) = 0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun + 0.3 - log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun`\n        *   The solar abundance term cancels out, as expected.\n        *   `log10(R) = 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6`.\n    *   To find the ratio `R`, we take the antilogarithm: `R = 10^0.6`.\n\n7.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   The final step is to compute the value of 10^0.6. This requires a calculator. A Python script is a reliable way to do this.\n\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Calculate 10 raised to the power of 0.6\n    ratio = math.pow(10, 0.6)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n\n8.  **Final Answer Formulation:** The result of the calculation `10^0.6` is approximately 3.98. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) ~3.9\n    *   B) ~12.6\n    *   C) ~0.8\n    *   D) ~1.2\n    The calculated value is very close to 3.9. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
