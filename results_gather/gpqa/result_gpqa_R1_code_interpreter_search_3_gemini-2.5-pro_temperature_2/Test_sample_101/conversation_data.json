    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Setup:**\n    *   **Goal:** Trace the fate of neural crest cells expressing a specific ligand-receptor pair.\n    *   **Tool:** A bicistronic (\"two-gene\") DNA construct designed to be activated by Cre recombinase.\n    *   **Promoter:** The CBA promoter drives expression of the entire construct. CBA is a strong, ubiquitous promoter, meaning it's generally active in all cell types.\n    *   **Gene 1 (Ligand):** Ligand is followed by a \"loxP-stop-loxP\" cassette, and then an mCherry fluorescent tag. Without Cre recombinase, transcription produces an mRNA, but translation stops before mCherry. When Cre is present, it cuts out the \"stop\" cassette, and a Ligand-mCherry fusion protein is made.\n    *   **IRES:** This element allows ribosomes to start translation a second time on the same mRNA molecule, in order to produce the second protein.\n    *   **Gene 2 (Receptor):** Receptor is followed by a \"lox2272-stop-lox2272\" cassette, and then an eGFP fluorescent tag at the C-terminus. Similar to the first gene, this is a Cre-dependent system. When Cre is present, a Receptor-eGFP fusion protein should be made.\n    *   **The Cross:** A mouse carrying this construct (Reporter) is crossed with a SOX10-Cre mouse. SOX10 is a gene active in neural crest cells. Therefore, in the offspring, only neural crest cells and their descendants will have active Cre recombinase.\n    *   **Expected Result:** In SOX10-expressing cells of the offspring, Cre should remove both stop cassettes, leading to the production of both Ligand-mCherry (red) and Receptor-eGFP (green) proteins.\n\n2.  **Analyze the In Vitro Control Experiment:**\n    *   The construct was transfected into astrocyte cells and tested with a Western blot.\n    *   The result showed a \"signal proportional to the actin loading\" using antibodies against the ligand and receptor.\n    *   This control experiment is crucial. It confirms that the non-recombined plasmid can successfully express the standalone ligand and receptor proteins (since the stop cassettes are still in place). However, this test **does not** verify that the fusion proteins (Ligand-mCherry and Receptor-eGFP) can be made correctly after Cre-mediated recombination. It specifically does not confirm that the eGFP part of the construct is functional or correctly attached to the receptor.\n\n3.  **Analyze the In Vivo Observation:**\n    *   The key finding is the **absence of a green signal (eGFP)** in the offspring mice. The question asks for the most likely reason for this specific failure.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing:** This is incorrect. The construct doesn't use the natural enhancers of the ligand/receptor genes. It uses the strong, ubiquitous CBA promoter to drive expression. The SOX10-Cre system is used to *activate the reporters* in specific cells, not to drive the initial expression.\n    *   **B) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship:** This describes how the cells might communicate (one cell secretes the ligand, another cell receives it). While this might be the biological reality, it has no bearing on whether a cell that has the genetic instructions to make a Receptor-eGFP protein will actually do so. The expression of the construct within a single cell is independent of its external interactions. This option is biologically irrelevant to the question of reporter gene expression.\n    *   **C) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi:** The receptor is a complex transmembrane protein (8 helices). Fusing a large protein like eGFP to its C-terminus can interfere with its proper folding, processing, or transport through the cell's secretory pathway (ER and Golgi). A severely misfolded protein is often retained in the ER/Golgi and targeted for rapid degradation by the cell's quality control systems. This would lead to protein levels too low to be detected, resulting in no green signal. This is a very plausible biological reason for the experiment's failure.\n    *   **D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame:** For two protein-coding sequences to be fused together to create a single, functional fusion protein, their open reading frames (ORFs) must be continuous. This means the number of DNA base pairs between the last coding codon of the receptor and the first coding codon of eGFP must be a multiple of three. If it's not, a \"frameshift\" occurs. The ribosome will read the eGFP sequence in the wrong frame, producing a meaningless string of amino acids, and will quickly encounter a premature stop codon. A functional eGFP chromophore will not be formed. This non-functional, truncated peptide will be rapidly degraded. This is a very common and fundamental error made during the molecular cloning (creation) of the DNA construct.\n\n5.  **Compare the Most Plausible Options (C vs. D):**\n    *   Both C and D can explain the complete absence of a green signal.\n    *   However, the provided information points more strongly towards D. The in vitro control experiment was insufficient. It showed the receptor *alone* could be expressed, but it **did not test the Receptor-eGFP fusion**. A frameshift error is a fundamental mistake in the construct's \"blueprint\" that guarantees the desired protein can never be made correctly.\n    *   In troubleshooting biological experiments, the principle of Occam's razor suggests favoring the simplest explanation. A technical cloning error (frameshift) is often a more direct and fundamental cause of failure than a complex biological problem like protein misfolding/trafficking. The fact that the fusion protein's expression was never validated in the control experiment makes the possibility of a cloning error like a frameshift the most likely culprit.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a multiple-choice question about a molecular biology experiment.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the experimental setup:**\n*   **Goal:** To understand the developmental fate of cells expressing a new ligand-receptor pair from the neural crest.\n*   **Tool:** A bicistronic, conditional mouse model. The construct uses the Cre-Lox system.\n*   **Construct Details:**\n    *   **Promoter:** CBA (Chicken Beta-Actin promoter), a strong, ubiquitous promoter. This means the construct can be transcribed in most cell types.\n    *   **First Gene:** Ligand ORF, followed by a `loxP-stop-loxP` cassette, followed by an mCherry fluorescent tag. When Cre recombinase is present, it will cut out the stop cassette, allowing for the translation of a Ligand-mCherry fusion protein (red).\n    *   **IRES:** An Internal Ribosome Entry Site is placed between the two main parts of the construct. This allows a single mRNA molecule to be translated into two separate proteins.\n    *   **Second Gene:** Receptor ORF, followed by a `lox2272-stop-lox2272` cassette, followed by an eGFP fluorescent tag at the C-terminus. When Cre is present, it will cut out this stop cassette, allowing for the translation of a Receptor-eGFP fusion protein (green). Cre can recognize and recombine both loxP and lox2272 sites.\n*   **In Vitro Control:** The plasmid was transfected into primary astrocytes. A Western blot was performed using antibodies against the ligand and the receptor. The result showed a signal, confirming that the plasmid can express the ligand and the receptor proteins on their own (before the stop codons are removed). This control *does not* verify the expression of the fusion proteins (Ligand-mCherry and Receptor-eGFP).\n*   **In Vivo Experiment:** The mouse with the construct (homozygous) is crossed with a `SOX10-Cre` mouse (hemizygous). SOX10 is a transcription factor that is specifically expressed in neural crest cells and their derivatives.\n*   **Expected Outcome:** In the offspring, any cell derived from the neural crest will have active Cre recombinase. This should remove both stop cassettes, leading to the expression of Ligand-mCherry (red) and Receptor-eGFP (green).\n*   **Actual Observation:** \"You do not observe a green signal.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the problem:**\nThe core problem is the absence of the eGFP signal, and we need to find the most likely cause among the given options.\n\n**3. Evaluate the options:**\n\n*   **A) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing:** This is incorrect. The expression is driven by the ubiquitous CBA promoter, which has its own strong enhancer elements. The tissue specificity is provided by the `SOX10-Cre` driver mouse, which activates the reporter only in the target cells (neural crest). Therefore, a specific enhancer for the ligand or receptor is not needed in this construct.\n\n*   **B) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship:** A paracrine relationship means a cell secretes the ligand, and a different, nearby cell receives the signal via the receptor. While this may describe the biological function of the pair, it doesn't explain why a cell that has the gene for Receptor-eGFP fails to produce a green signal. The production of the fluorescent fusion protein is an intracellular process. Whether the signaling is autocrine or paracrine is irrelevant to the expression of the reporter construct within a single cell.\n\n*   **C) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi:** The receptor is a complex transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices. Attaching a large protein like eGFP (around 27 kDa) to the C-terminus of such a protein can interfere with its proper folding, post-translational modifications, or trafficking through the secretory pathway (ER-Golgi). If the fusion protein is severely misfolded, the cell's quality control machinery would likely retain it in the ER or Golgi and target it for degradation. This would lead to protein levels too low to be detected, resulting in no green signal. This is a very plausible biological reason for the failure.\n\n*   **D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame:** For a fusion protein to be created, the DNA sequences of the two proteins must be joined together in a way that maintains the correct \"reading frame.\" The genetic code is read in groups of three nucleotides (codons). If the DNA sequence for the receptor and the sequence for eGFP are ligated together with a number of nucleotides between them that is not a multiple of three, a \"frameshift\" mutation will occur. The ribosome will read the eGFP sequence in the wrong frame, producing a garbled string of amino acids, and it will almost certainly encounter a premature stop codon. A functional eGFP protein with its specific fluorophore will not be formed. This is a very common and fundamental error during the molecular cloning phase when the DNA construct is built. The in vitro Western blot control would not have detected this issue because it only tested for the expression of the receptor itself, not the Receptor-eGFP fusion.\n\n**4. Compare the most likely options (C vs. D):**\nBoth C and D are plausible explanations for the lack of a green signal. However, a frameshift mutation (D) is a fundamental error in the DNA blueprint of the construct. It guarantees that a correct fusion protein can *never* be synthesized. Protein misfolding and trafficking issues (C) are a biological consequence of the protein's structure. While possible, especially with complex transmembrane proteins, it's not as absolute as a frameshift. In troubleshooting molecular biology experiments, simple, fatal flaws in the construct design (like a frameshift) are a very common and primary cause of failure. Given that the experiment did not include a control to validate the expression of the Receptor-eGFP *fusion* protein itself, a cloning error like a frameshift is the most direct and likely explanation for a complete and total lack of signal.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Excellent! Let's think through this problem.\n\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal and the Tools:** The primary goal is to use a genetic tool to trace the lineage of neural crest cells that express a specific ligand and receptor. The tool is a mouse with a bicistronic, Cre-dependent reporter construct.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reporter Construct:**\n    *   **Promoter:** CBA (Chicken Beta-Actin) is a strong, ubiquitous promoter. This means the machinery to transcribe this construct's mRNA should be present in almost all cells of the mouse.\n    *   **Ligand part:** `Ligand ORF - [loxP-stop-loxP] - mCherry`. Without Cre, translation stops after the ligand is made. With Cre, the \"stop\" cassette is removed, and a `Ligand-mCherry` fusion protein is produced. This should result in red fluorescence.\n    *   **Receptor part:** `IRES - Receptor ORF - [lox2272-stop-lox2272] - eGFP`. The IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site) allows ribosomes to initiate translation on the same mRNA a second time. Without Cre, translation stops after the receptor is made. With Cre, the \"stop\" cassette is removed, and a `Receptor-eGFP` fusion protein is produced. This should result in green fluorescence.\n\n3.  **Analyze the In Vitro Control Experiment:**\n    *   The construct (as a plasmid) was put into astrocyte cells. These cells do not express Cre recombinase.\n    *   A Western blot was performed using antibodies that recognize the ligand and the receptor.\n    *   The experiment showed a signal for the proteins. This is an important control. It confirms that the construct is capable of expressing the standalone ligand and the standalone receptor (since the stop codons are still in place).\n    *   **Crucial Limitation of this control:** This experiment **does not** test whether the fusion proteins (`Ligand-mCherry` and `Receptor-eGFP`) can be correctly produced and function *after* Cre-mediated recombination. It only confirms the first part of each open reading frame (ORF) is expressible.\n\n4.  **Analyze the In Vivo Experiment:**\n    *   The reporter mouse is crossed with a `SOX10-Cre` mouse.\n    *   SOX10 is a key transcription factor in the neural crest. Therefore, Cre recombinase will be active *only* in neural crest cells and their descendants.\n    *   **Expected Result:** In SOX10-positive cells, Cre should excise both \"stop\" cassettes, leading to the production of both a red fusion protein (Ligand-mCherry) and a green fusion protein (Receptor-eGFP).\n    *   **Observed Result:** There is **no green signal**. The question asks for the most likely reason for this specific failure.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Possible Explanations:**\n\n    *   **A) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing:** This is incorrect. The construct doesn't rely on the natural enhancers of the ligand and receptor. It uses the strong, ubiquitous CBA promoter to drive transcription. The tissue-specific *activation* of the reporters is controlled by the `SOX10-Cre` driver, not by an enhancer in the reporter construct.\n\n    *   **B) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship:** This describes a biological mode of cell-to-cell communication (one cell signals, another receives). This is irrelevant to whether an individual cell can successfully synthesize the Receptor-eGFP protein it has the genetic instructions for. The problem lies in protein production, not cell-cell interaction.\n\n    *   **C) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi:** This is a plausible biological issue. The receptor is described as a complex transmembrane protein. Fusing a large tag like eGFP to its C-terminus can disrupt its proper folding or ability to be transported out of the ER and Golgi apparatus. If the protein is misfolded, the cell's quality control systems would trap and destroy it, leading to no visible signal.\n\n    *   **D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame:** This is a fundamental molecular cloning error. For two coding sequences to be fused and read correctly as a single, continuous protein, their reading frames must be aligned. The genetic code is read in codons of three nucleotides. If the junction between the receptor ORF and the eGFP ORF contains a number of nucleotides that isn't a multiple of three, a \"frameshift\" mutation occurs. This scrambles the amino acid sequence of eGFP, inevitably leading to a premature stop codon. A functional, fluorescent eGFP protein cannot be formed under any circumstances. This error is in the very blueprint (the DNA) of the construct.\n\n6.  **Compare the most likely options (C vs. D):**\n    *   Both C and D would result in a lack of green signal.\n    *   However, D represents a more fundamental, technical error in the construction of the plasmid. A frameshift error is an absolute \"showstopper\" for producing the intended protein.\n    *   The *in vitro* experiment failed to test the very thing that is now failing *in vivo*: the expression of the Receptor-eGFP fusion. A frameshift error is a very common mistake in molecular cloning and perfectly explains why a signal is completely absent. While misfolding (C) is also possible, a basic cloning error (D) is often considered a more primary and likely culprit when a fusion protein fails to appear at all, especially when its expression has not been previously validated.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation is that a mistake was made when ligating the eGFP sequence to the receptor sequence, causing a frameshift mutation.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is an excellent and detailed question that requires breaking down a complex molecular biology experiment. Here is the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Goal:** The researcher wants to label and track neural crest cells that express a specific ligand-receptor pair. They are using a sophisticated genetic technique (Cre-Lox) to do this in a mouse model.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Genetic Construct:**\n    *   **Bicistronic Design:** The construct is designed to produce two separate proteins (or fusion proteins) from a single mRNA molecule. The `IRES` element is key for this, allowing ribosomes to start translating a second time in the middle of the mRNA.\n    *   **Promoter:** The `CBA` promoter is a strong, ubiquitous promoter. This means the mRNA for this construct should be transcribed in virtually all cells of the mouse. The control of expression is not at the transcription level but at the translation/recombination level.\n    *   **Conditional Activation (Cre-Lox):**\n        *   **Ligand part:** `Ligand ORF - loxP-stop-loxP - mCherry`. Without the Cre enzyme, translation hits the stop codon after making the ligand. With Cre, the enzyme snips out the DNA between the two `loxP` sites (the stop cassette), so the ribosome now reads through to make a single `Ligand-mCherry` fusion protein.\n        *   **Receptor part:** `Receptor ORF - lox2272-stop-lox2272 - eGFP`. This works exactly the same way, but with a different variant of the lox site (`lox2272`). Cre recombinase is capable of recognizing and acting on both loxP and lox2272 sites. When Cre is present, it removes the stop cassette, allowing the creation of a `Receptor-eGFP` fusion protein.\n\n3.  **Analyze the *in vivo* Experiment:**\n    *   **The Cross:** A mouse carrying the reporter construct is crossed with a `SOX10-Cre` mouse.\n    *   **The Biology:** SOX10 is a transcription factor that is a well-established marker for neural crest cells and their derivatives. This means the `Cre` recombinase will only be expressed (and therefore active) in these specific cells.\n    *   **Expected Result:** In the offspring, cells of neural crest origin should have active Cre. Cre will remove both stop cassettes. These cells should then produce both the red `Ligand-mCherry` protein and the green `Receptor-eGFP` protein.\n    *   **Actual Result:** No green signal is observed. The red signal is not mentioned, but the question focuses on the missing green one.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Possible Explanations for the Missing Green Signal:**\n\n    *   **A) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing:** This is incorrect. The expression of the construct is not driven by the natural enhancers of the ligand and receptor. It's driven by the provided `CBA` promoter, which is strong and generally active everywhere. The tissue specificity comes from the `SOX10-Cre` mouse, which ensures the \"stop\" cassettes are only removed in the correct cells.\n\n    *   **B) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship:** This describes how the cells communicate with each other (paracrine = signaling to a neighbor). While this might be true biologically, it has no impact on whether a cell can successfully synthesize the `Receptor-eGFP` protein internally. The problem is a failure of protein production, not cell-cell interaction.\n\n    *   **C) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi:** This is a plausible biological explanation. The receptor is described as a complex transmembrane protein. Fusing a large protein tag like eGFP to it can sometimes cause the entire fusion protein to misfold. The cell's quality-control machinery (primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi) would recognize the misfolded protein, trap it, and target it for degradation, leading to no visible signal.\n\n    *   **D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame:** This is a fundamental error in molecular cloning. For two protein-coding sequences to be joined together to make one larger functional protein, their \"reading frames\" must be aligned. The genetic code is read in sets of three nucleotides (codons). If the DNA connecting the receptor gene and the eGFP gene doesn't contain a number of base pairs that is a multiple of three, a **frameshift mutation** occurs. The ribosome will read the eGFP portion of the mRNA using the wrong set of three-letter codes, producing a nonsensical chain of amino acids and quickly encountering a premature stop codon. As a result, a functional, fluorescent eGFP protein will never be created.\n\n5.  **Conclusion: Comparing C and D**\n    *   Both C and D are possible reasons for a failed experiment. However, the `in vitro` control experiment is the deciding piece of information. The researcher confirmed that the receptor *alone* can be expressed from the plasmid. But they **did not** test if the `Receptor-eGFP` *fusion protein* could be made after Cre recombination.\n    *   A frameshift mutation (D) is a simple, catastrophic error in the DNA construct's design that guarantees the fusion protein can never be made correctly.\n    *   Protein misfolding and getting stuck in the Golgi (C) is a more complex biological outcome.\n    *   In troubleshooting, it is most common to suspect a fundamental flaw in the experimental tool itself, especially in a part that was never explicitly tested. A cloning error like a frameshift is a classic and very common reason why fusion protein reporters fail. It is the most direct and likely explanation for a complete lack of signal.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is an excellent question that tests the understanding of molecular cloning, gene expression constructs, and experimental troubleshooting. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal and the Experimental Design:** The researcher aims to create a mouse model to visualize cells expressing a specific ligand-receptor pair originating from the neural crest. To do this, they designed a complex genetic reporter that is activated by Cre recombinase.\n\n2.  **Dissect the Genetic Construct:**\n    *   **Promoter:** It's driven by the CBA promoter, which is strong and active in most cell types. This means the potential for expression is widespread.\n    *   **Tissue Specificity:** The specificity is not controlled by the promoter but by the use of a `SOX10-Cre` mouse. Cre recombinase, the \"on\" switch, will only be present in neural crest cells (where SOX10 is active) and their descendants.\n    *   **The Reporter System (Conditional):** The construct uses a \"lox-stop-lox\" system for both genes.\n        *   `Ligand-[loxP-stop-loxP]-mCherry`: Without Cre, only the ligand is made. With Cre, the stop cassette is excised, and a red fusion protein (`Ligand-mCherry`) is produced.\n        *   `Receptor-[lox2272-stop-lox2272]-eGFP`: Similarly, with Cre, a green fusion protein (`Receptor-eGFP`) should be produced. The IRES element allows this second protein to be translated from the same mRNA molecule.\n\n3.  **Analyze the In Vitro Control:** The construct was tested in astrocytes.\n    *   **What was done:** The plasmid was transfected (no Cre), and a Western blot was performed with antibodies against the ligand and the receptor.\n    *   **What this confirms:** It confirms that without Cre, the plasmid can successfully produce the standalone ligand protein and the standalone receptor protein. This shows the CBA promoter, the ORFs for the ligand and receptor, and the IRES element are all functional.\n    *   **What this does NOT confirm:** This control experiment **does not** test what happens after Cre-mediated recombination. It provides no information about whether the `Ligand-mCherry` or `Receptor-eGFP` **fusion proteins** can be correctly synthesized and are functional.\n\n4.  **Analyze the In Vivo Result:** The cross with the `SOX10-Cre` mouse is performed. The key observation is the **complete absence of a green signal**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Each Potential Explanation:**\n\n    *   **A) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing:** This is incorrect. The ubiquitous CBA promoter contains its own powerful enhancer elements. The cell-type-specific expression is achieved by the `SOX10-Cre` system, which conditionally activates the pre-transcribed construct, not by a tissue-specific enhancer.\n\n    *   **B) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship:** This describes how the cells might communicate with each other, but it is irrelevant to the intracellular process of protein synthesis. A cell with the correct genetic instructions should produce the green protein regardless of how it interacts with its neighbors.\n\n    *   **C) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi:** This is a plausible biological issue. The receptor is a complex transmembrane protein. Fusing a large tag like eGFP to its C-terminus can disrupt proper folding, leading to its retention in the ER/Golgi and eventual degradation by the cell's quality control systems. This would result in a lack of signal.\n\n    *   **D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame:** This is a fundamental error in the design of the construct's DNA sequence. For the ribosome to read through from the receptor sequence to the eGFP sequence and create one continuous, functional protein, their coding sequences must be \"in frame.\" This means the number of DNA bases linking them must be a multiple of three. If not, a **frameshift mutation** occurs, scrambling the amino acid sequence of eGFP and almost always leading to a premature stop codon. A functional eGFP protein cannot possibly be made. This is a very common and fatal error in molecular cloning.\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    Both (C) and (D) could explain the lack of a green signal. However, (D) represents a more fundamental and likely error. A frameshift mutation is an error in the construct's \"blueprint\" that makes the intended outcome impossible from the start. Crucially, the *in vitro* control experiment did not test the integrity of the fusion protein, so this type of error would have gone unnoticed. In troubleshooting biological experiments, a primary suspect is always a flaw in the tool itself, especially in a part that was never validated. A simple cloning error (frameshift) is a more direct and common cause for the complete failure of a fusion protein than a complex biological interaction like misfolding and degradation.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal. Which of the answers below explains the most likely reason for it?\n\nA) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing\nB) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship\nC) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi\nD) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
