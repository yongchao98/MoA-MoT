    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm (two equivalent alkene protons) and the ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This is the classic description of maleic acid being dehydrated to **maleic anhydride**. Maleic anhydride is a common dienophile in Diels-Alder reactions.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds (C1=C2 and C3=C4). The carbons involved in the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) each have a methyl group. C5 is a CH₂ group.\n\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This reaction forms a six-membered ring. Because the diene is cyclic, the product is a bicyclic system. Specifically, it will be a derivative of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. The reaction yields two products, major and minor. These correspond to the *endo* and *exo* stereoisomers.\n    *   **The \"Alder Endo Rule\"** states that the kinetic product (usually the major product) of a Diels-Alder reaction is the *endo* isomer. This is due to favorable secondary orbital overlap in the transition state. The thermodynamic product (more stable, less sterically hindered) is the *exo* isomer, which is typically the minor product.\n    *   So, we can conclude:\n        *   **Major product = *Endo* adduct**\n        *   **Minor product = *Exo* adduct**\n\n    *   Let's sketch the structures of the endo and exo products:\n        *   The skeleton is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n        *   The CH₂ group from the diene becomes the C7 methylene bridge.\n        *   The original C1 and C4 of the diene become the bridgehead carbons. They each bear a methyl group. Let's call these **bridgehead methyls**.\n        *   The original C2 and C3 of the diene form the new double bond. They each bear a methyl group. Let's call these **vinylic methyls**.\n        *   The two carbons from maleic anhydride are fused to the system, forming the anhydride ring. The two protons on these carbons are methine protons. Let's call these **methine protons**.\n\n    *   **Stereochemical Difference:**\n        *   ***Endo* Isomer:** The fused anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the electron-rich C(Me)=C(Me) double bond and *anti* (on the opposite side) to the CH₂ bridge.\n        *   ***Exo* Isomer:** The fused anhydride ring is oriented *anti* to the C(Me)=C(Me) double bond and *syn* to the CH₂ bridge.\n\n3.  **Analyze the NMR Data (NOESY)**\n    *   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals means the corresponding protons are spatially proximate.\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** (endo) but **absent or weak in the minor product** (exo).\n    *   This means we must find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n4.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals from the Options**\n    *   Based on general chemical shift principles for this type of structure:\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls:** (6H) on saturated bridgehead carbons. They should be the most shielded. The `6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm` in option C is a good fit.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyls:** (6H) on a carbon-carbon double bond. They are deshielded compared to normal alkyl methyls. The `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm` in options A and C is a very reasonable assignment.\n        *   **Methine Protons:** (2H) from the anhydride, adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. They will be significantly deshielded. The `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` in options A and D is a good fit.\n        *   **Bridge Protons:** (2H, a CH₂) on the methylene bridge. They are diastereotopic and typically appear as two separate doublets in the range of 1-2 ppm. The `1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm` in options B and D likely corresponds to one of these protons.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Proton Proximity in Each Isomer**\n    *   Let's check the proton pairs in the options based on their proximity in the *endo* vs. *exo* isomers.\n\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Vinylic Me) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Methine H):**\n        *   In the ***endo* isomer (major)**, the anhydride ring (with methine H's) is folded underneath the bicyclic system, directly towards the C(Me)=C(Me) double bond. The methine protons and the vinylic methyl groups are **close in space**. An NOE is expected.\n        *   In the ***exo* isomer (minor)**, the anhydride ring is folded away from the C(Me)=C(Me) double bond. The methine protons and the vinylic methyls are **far apart**. An NOE is not expected.\n        *   **This matches the experimental observation perfectly.**\n\n    *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Bridgehead Me) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Bridge H):**\n        *   The bridgehead methyls and the bridge protons are attached to adjacent carbons in the bicyclic frame. Their distance is fixed by the rigid skeleton and is essentially the same in both *endo* and *exo* isomers. An NOE would be expected in both. This does not fit.\n\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Bridgehead Me) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Vinylic Me):**\n        *   Similar to B, these two sets of methyl groups are part of the main bicyclic framework. Their spatial relationship does not change significantly between the *endo* and *exo* isomers. An NOE would be expected in both. This does not fit.\n\n    *   **D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Bridge H) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Methine H):**\n        *   In the ***endo* isomer (major)**, the anhydride ring (methine H's) is *anti* to the CH₂ bridge (bridge H's). They are **far apart**. An NOE is not expected.\n        *   In the ***exo* isomer (minor)**, the anhydride ring is *syn* to the CH₂ bridge. They are **close in space**. An NOE is expected.\n        *   This is the **exact opposite** of the observation given in the problem.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion**\n    The only pair of protons that are close in the major (*endo*) product and far apart in the minor (*exo*) product are the vinylic methyl protons (~1.7 ppm) and the methine protons (~3.5 ppm). Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak connects these two signals.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a Diels-Alder reaction and subsequent NMR interpretation.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl). This is the classic description of **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   The two protons on the double bond are equivalent due to symmetry, giving a single ¹H NMR signal.\n    *   The two carbons of the double bond are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, giving two ¹³C NMR signals.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the reaction and its products.**\n*   The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   Because the diene is cyclic, the product will be a bicyclic system. The backbone will be a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene structure.\n*   The reaction produces a major and a minor product. In Diels-Alder reactions, these correspond to the *endo* and *exo* stereoisomers.\n*   According to the **Alder Endo Rule**, the kinetic product, which is usually the major product, is the **endo isomer**. The more thermodynamically stable but sterically hindered **exo isomer** is typically the minor product.\n    *   **Major product = *Endo* adduct**\n    *   **Minor product = *Exo* adduct**\n\n**Step 3: Visualize the stereochemistry of the *endo* and *exo* products.**\n*   In the **endo adduct (major product)**, the fused anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) with respect to the electron-rich C=C double bond of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system. It is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the one-carbon bridge (C7).\n*   In the **exo adduct (minor product)**, the fused anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C=C double bond and *syn* to the one-carbon bridge.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the NOESY NMR data.**\n*   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment detects protons that are close in space (typically less than 5 Angstroms). A cross-peak connects the signals of two protons that are spatially proximate.\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product (*endo*)** but **absent in the minor product (*exo*)**.\n*   We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n**Step 5: Assign the ¹H NMR signals given in the options to the protons in the product structure.**\n*   The product has several types of protons:\n    1.  **Vinylic methyl protons (6H):** Two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. By symmetry, they are equivalent. Due to being on a double bond, they will be relatively deshielded for methyl groups. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is a good assignment for these.\n    2.  **Bridgehead methyl protons (6H):** Two methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons (where the rings meet). They are on saturated carbons and should be the most upfield (shielded). A **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm** would fit these (this signal is mentioned in option C but is not part of the correct answer pair).\n    3.  **Anhydride methine protons (2H):** These are the two protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are equivalent by symmetry. Being adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, they are highly deshielded. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n    4.  **Bridge methylene protons (2H total):** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic and not equivalent. They would give rise to complex signals. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** likely corresponds to one of these protons.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the proton distances in both isomers.**\n*   **Pair A: Vinylic methyl protons (~1.7 ppm) and Anhydride methine protons (~3.5 ppm).**\n    *   In the **endo (major)** product, the anhydride ring with its methine protons is tucked under the bicyclic system, bringing these protons very **close** to the vinylic methyl groups. A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected.\n    *   In the **exo (minor)** product, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the C=C bond. The methine protons and vinylic methyl groups are **far apart**. A NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n    *   **This perfectly matches the experimental observation.**\n\n*   **Pair D: Bridge methylene proton (~1.5 ppm) and Anhydride methine proton (~3.5 ppm).**\n    *   In the **endo (major)** product, the anhydride ring is *anti* to the methylene bridge. These protons are **far apart**. No NOE is expected.\n    *   In the **exo (minor)** product, the anhydride ring is *syn* to the methylene bridge. These protons are **close**. An NOE would be expected in the minor product.\n    *   This is the opposite of the experimental observation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the vinylic methyl protons and the anhydride methine protons.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires a detailed understanding of the Diels-Alder reaction, its stereochemical outcomes (endo/exo selectivity), and the interpretation of 2D NOESY NMR spectra.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\n\n1.  **Dienophile:** The description points to maleic anhydride.\n    *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   The NMR data for the anhydride confirms this structure. Due to symmetry (a C₂ axis), the two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, leading to a single peak in the ¹H NMR spectrum (~7.1 ppm). Similarly, the two alkene carbons are equivalent (~137 ppm), and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent (~165 ppm), resulting in only two peaks in the ¹³C NMR spectrum.\n\n2.  **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n3.  **Reaction:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This reaction is stereospecific and typically follows the **Alder Endo Rule**, which dictates the major stereochemical outcome.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products\n\nThe Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclic diene and a dienophile produces a bicyclic adduct. Two stereoisomers are possible: *endo* and *exo*.\n\n*   **Alder Endo Rule:** The kinetic product (and thus usually the major product) is the *endo* adduct. This stereoisomer is favored due to stabilizing secondary orbital overlap in the transition state. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamic product (less sterically hindered) but forms more slowly, making it the minor product.\n    *   **Major Product = *Endo* adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Exo* adduct**\n\nLet's visualize the difference:\n*   In the **endo adduct (major)**, the fused anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same face) to the newly formed double bond (which now has two methyl groups on it) and *anti* (on the opposite face) to the C7-methylene bridge.\n*   In the **exo adduct (minor)**, the fused anhydride ring is *anti* to the double bond and *syn* to the C7-methylene bridge.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the NOESY Spectra\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** reveals which protons are close to each other in 3D space. A cross-peak between two signals indicates spatial proximity (typically < 5 Å).\n*   **Key Information:** A specific cross-peak is **present in the spectrum of the major product (*endo*)** but is **absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor product (*exo*)**.\n*   Our task is to find a pair of protons that are close together in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n### Step 4: Assign Chemical Shifts and Evaluate Proximity\n\nLet's assign the ¹H NMR signals from the options to the protons in the product molecule and then check their spatial relationship in both isomers.\n\n*   **Product Protons:**\n    *   **Vinylic Methyls (6H):** Methyl groups on the C=C bond. A singlet around **~1.7 ppm** is a very reasonable assignment.\n    *   **Anhydride Methine Protons (2H):** Protons on the anhydride part, adjacent to the carbonyls. They are highly deshielded. A singlet around **~3.5 ppm** is a correct assignment.\n    *   **Bridge Methylene Protons (2H total):** The two protons on the one-carbon bridge. A **~1.5 ppm** signal would fit for one of these.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls (6H):** Methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons. They would be the most shielded (~1.0 ppm).\n\nNow let's check the options based on spatial proximity:\n\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Vinylic Methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Anhydride Methine Protons)**\n    *   **In the *endo* (major) product:** The anhydride ring is tucked under the C=C double bond. The anhydride methine protons are **spatially close** to the vinylic methyl groups. **A strong NOE cross-peak is expected.**\n    *   **In the *exo* (minor) product:** The anhydride ring points away from the C=C double bond. The anhydride methine protons are **far** from the vinylic methyl groups. **No NOE cross-peak is expected.**\n    *   **Conclusion:** This matches the experimental data perfectly.\n\n*   **B) & C):** These options involve protons whose relative distances are fixed within the rigid bicyclic frame (bridgehead methyls vs. bridge protons or bridgehead methyls vs. vinylic methyls). Their distance doesn't change significantly between the *endo* and *exo* isomers, so they cannot explain the difference in the NOESY spectra.\n\n*   **D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Bridge Methylene Proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Anhydride Methine Protons)**\n    *   **In the *endo* (major) product:** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the methylene bridge. The protons are **far apart**. **No NOE cross-peak is expected.**\n    *   **In the *exo* (minor) product:** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the methylene bridge. The protons are **close**. **A NOE cross-peak would be expected for the minor product.**\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is the opposite of the experimental observation.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak present in the major product connects the vinylic methyl protons (~1.7 ppm) and the anhydride methine protons (~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step deduction based on knowledge of organic reactions and NMR spectroscopy.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants\n\n*   **The Dienophile:** The problem describes \"A dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene\" that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The classic example of this is maleic acid. When dehydrated, it forms **maleic anhydride**. The NMR data for this anhydride confirms its identity:\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Maleic anhydride is a highly symmetrical molecule. The two protons on the double bond are chemically equivalent, so they appear as a single peak. The given chemical shift of 7 ppm is appropriate for these electron-deficient alkene protons.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Similarly, the two alkene carbons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, leading to just two peaks in the spectrum (at ~137 ppm and ~165 ppm respectively), which matches the data given.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly identifies the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Reaction and its Stereochemical Products\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   Because the diene is cyclic, the reaction creates a bicyclic product.\n*   This reaction produces two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* product. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n*   According to the **Alder Endo Rule**, the kinetic product, which is almost always the major product, is the **endo isomer**.

These protons are **close**. **An NOE would be expected here.**\n    *   This is the exact opposite of what the problem describes.\n\n*   **B) and C):** These options involve pairs of protons within the main bicyclic framework. Their relative distances are largely fixed by the rigid ring system and do not change significantly between the *endo* and *exo* isomers. Therefore, they cannot account for a NOESY cross-peak that appears in one isomer but not the other.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of protons that are close in the major (*endo*) product and far apart in the minor (*exo*) product are the vinylic methyl protons and the anhydride methine protons.

Since the diene is cyclic, the product will be a bicyclic adduct.\n\n2.  **Stereoisomers:** The reaction forms two products, a major and a minor one.

A strong NOE interaction is expected.\n    *   In the **exo adduct (minor product)**, the fused anhydride ring is oriented \"away\" from the C=C double bond. In this case, the **anhydride methine protons (~3.5 ppm)** are **far** from the **vinylic methyl protons (~1.7 ppm)**. No significant NOE interaction is expected.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The observation of a cross-peak between a signal at ~1.7 ppm and a signal at ~3.5 ppm in the major product, but not the minor product, is perfectly explained by the endo/exo geometries.\n\nLet's quickly check option D as a sanity check:\n*   **Pairing: Bridge proton (~1.5 ppm) and Anhydride methine proton (~3.5 ppm)**\n    *   In the *endo* isomer, these are far apart (*anti*). No NOE expected.\n    *   In the *exo* isomer, these are close (*syn*). An NOE would be expected.\n    *   This is the opposite of the experimental observation.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the vinylic methyl protons and the anhydride methine protons.\n\n<<<A>>>"

This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?\n\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nD) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
