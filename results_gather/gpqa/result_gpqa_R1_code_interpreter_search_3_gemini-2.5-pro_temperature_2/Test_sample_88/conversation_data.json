    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2). Adamantane has a tricyclic cage structure.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh, basic conditions, suggesting elimination and/or rearrangement reactions.\n*   **Product 1 data:**\n    *   Formula: The ¹H NMR shows a total of 2 + 10 + 2 = 14 hydrogens. The IR spectrum shows a C=O group at 1720 cm⁻¹. This implies an oxygen atom was incorporated, likely from KOH/H2O. Thus, the molecular formula is C10H14O.\n    *   Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE): For C10H14O, DBE = (2C + 2 - H)/2 = (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4.\n    *   The adamantane cage (tricyclo[3.3.1.1³,⁷]decane) has 3 degrees of unsaturation. The ketone group (C=O) accounts for one more DBE. A saturated ketone isomer of adamantane (e.g., 2-adamantanone) would have DBE=4.\n    *   **Spectroscopy interpretation:**\n        *   The ¹H NMR peak at 4.79 ppm (2H) is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). This suggests Product 1 contains a C=C bond.\n        *   If Product 1 has a C=C bond and a C=O bond, it is an enone. The DBE count would be: 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) + 2 (rings) = 4. This is consistent with a **bicyclic enone** structure. The adamantane cage must have rearranged from a tricyclic system to a bicyclic one.\n        *   The NMR spectrum is very simple (3 signals for 14 protons), which implies a high degree of symmetry. The presence of a 2H signal for the vinylic protons means they are chemically equivalent due to a C2 axis of symmetry in the molecule. The double bond is therefore of the type `R-CH=CH-R`.\n\n**Conclusion for Product 1:** It is a symmetric bicyclic enone with the formula C10H14O, containing a `-CH=CH-` group.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide [Al(O-iPr)3]. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction.\n*   **Transformation:** MPV reduction selectively reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. For an enone, the carbonyl group is reduced, while the C=C double bond is typically left intact.\n*   **Product 2 structure:** The ketone group (C=O) in Product 1 is reduced to a secondary alcohol group (CH-OH). The product is a symmetric bicyclic allylic alcohol, C10H16O, still containing the `-CH=CH-` group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O3) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup.\n*   **Transformation:** Ozonolysis cleaves C=C double bonds. A `-CH=CH-` group is cleaved to form two aldehyde groups (`-CHO`). Since the double bond was part of a ring system in the bicyclic Product 2, this cleavage opens one of the rings.\n*   **Product 3 structure:** Product 3 is a **monocyclic dialdehyde-alcohol**. It is a C10 molecule containing two aldehyde groups and one alcohol group. Due to the C2 symmetry of its precursor (Product 2), the resulting Product 3 will also be symmetric, meaning the two aldehyde groups are chemically equivalent.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in Product 3.**\n\n*   **Most deshielded proton:** In a dialdehyde-alcohol structure, the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons are the aldehyde protons (-CHO). Their chemical shift is typically in the 9-10 ppm range, far downfield from any other C-H protons, including the H-C-OH proton (~3.5-4.5 ppm). The -OH proton is exchangeable and excluded by the question.\n*   **Coupling pattern (Splitting):** The splitting of an aldehyde proton's signal is determined by the number of protons on the adjacent carbon atom (the α-carbon), according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   The structure around the aldehyde groups in Product 3 is `-CαHn-CHO`.\n    *   Because Product 3 is symmetric, the environment of both aldehyde groups is identical. We need to determine `n`, the number of protons on the α-carbon.\n*   **Deducing `n`:** The α-carbons in Product 3 were the carbons adjacent to the double bond in Product 1 and 2. Let's call them Cα in the precursors as well. The structure of the precursor was `...-Cα-CH=CH-Cα-...`\n    *   If Cα had 0 protons (a quaternary carbon), the aldehyde proton in Product 3 would be a **singlet** (n=0, n+1=1).\n    *   If Cα had 1 proton (a CH group), the aldehyde proton would be a **doublet** (n=1, n+1=2).\n    *   If Cα had 2 protons (a CH2 group), the aldehyde proton would be a **triplet** (n=2, n+1=3).\n*   **Evaluating the options:**\n    *   A) doublet of triplets: requires a complex coupling environment (e.g., N=3 inequivalent protons, or long-range coupling).\n    *   B) triplet: corresponds to n=2 neighbors (a CH2 group).\n    *   C) pentet: corresponds to n=4 equivalent neighbors (e.g., from a CH group next to two equivalent CH2 groups, but this is the splitting of the CH proton, not the aldehyde). For an aldehyde, this is impossible.\n    *   D) triplet of triplets: corresponds to N=4 inequivalent protons (two sets of 2).\n\n*   Among the simple possibilities (singlet, doublet, triplet), only triplet is offered as an answer choice. This strongly suggests that the α-carbon is a methylene (-CH2-) group. This is structurally plausible and leads directly to one of the given options.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The most deshielded proton is the aldehyde proton. It is adjacent to a CH2 group. Therefore, its signal will be split into a triplet (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and functional groups of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2). Adamantane is a tricyclic alkane (tricyclo[3.3.1.1³,⁷]decane).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh conditions known to promote complex eliminations and rearrangements.\n*   **Product 1 Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **IR:** A characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. This frequency is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O) in a saturated ketone, such as one in a six-membered ring or a strained ring. If the ketone were conjugated with a double bond (an enone), the absorbance would be at a lower frequency (approx. 1685 cm⁻¹). Therefore, Product 1 contains a non-conjugated ketone.\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   A signal at 4.79 ppm with an integration of 2H. This chemical shift is in the vinylic region, indicating the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The 2H integration suggests a symmetrically substituted double bond, of the type `-CH=CH-`.\n        *   Other signals at 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) and 1.94 ppm (2H) are in the aliphatic region.\n        *   The total number of hydrogens is 2 + 10 + 2 = 14.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** The reaction involves the loss of the two bromine atoms and the incorporation of one oxygen atom, leading to a molecular formula of C10H14O. The spectroscopic data reveal that Product 1 is a ketone containing a non-conjugated, symmetric carbon-carbon double bond. The formation from the tricyclic adamantane framework under these conditions implies a skeletal rearrangement occurred, resulting in a bicyclic structure. (The degrees of unsaturation for C10H14O is 4: 1 for C=O, 1 for C=C, and 2 for the two rings of a bicyclic system).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide [Al(O-iPr)3].\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction.\n*   **Transformation:** The MPV reduction is a selective method for reducing aldehydes and ketones to alcohols. It does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) in Product 1 is reduced to a secondary alcohol group (-CHOH). The C=C double bond remains unchanged. Product 2 is a bicyclic unsaturated alcohol.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O3) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup.\n*   **Transformation:** Ozonolysis cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. A reductive workup (using DMS) converts the intermediate ozonide into carbonyl compounds. Specifically, a disubstituted alkene of the form `-CH=CH-` is cleaved to form two aldehyde groups (`-CHO`).\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** The C=C bond in the bicyclic Product 2 is cleaved. Since the double bond was part of a ring, this cleavage opens the ring, resulting in a **monocyclic** product. The `-CH=CH-` unit is converted into two `-CHO` groups. The alcohol group from Step 2 remains intact. Therefore, Product 3 is a **monocyclic dialdehyde-alcohol**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton in Product 3.**\n\n*   **Identifying the Proton:** In a molecule containing alcohol and aldehyde functional groups, the aldehyde protons (`-CHO`) are the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons, with a typical chemical shift (δ) of 9-10 ppm. The proton on the carbon bearing the alcohol (`-CHOH`) is much less deshielded (δ ≈ 3.5-4.5 ppm).\n*   **Applying the n+1 Rule:** The splitting pattern (multiplicity) of a proton's NMR signal is determined by the number of chemically equivalent protons (`n`) on the adjacent carbon(s). The number of peaks is given by the `n+1` rule.\n*   **Analyzing the Structure:** The aldehyde groups in Product 3 were formed from the carbons of the original C=C bond. The structure adjacent to each aldehyde is `...-Cα-CHO`, where Cα was the carbon atom adjacent to the double bond in Products 1 and 2. The splitting of the aldehyde proton depends on the number of protons on Cα.\n*   **Evaluating the Possibilities:**\n    *   If Cα has no protons (quaternary carbon), the aldehyde proton signal would be a singlet (n=0, n+1=1). This is not an option.\n    *   If Cα has one proton (methine group, CH), the signal would be a doublet (n=1, n+1=2). This is not an option.\n    *   If Cα has two protons (methylene group, CH2), the signal would be a **triplet** (n=2, n+1=3). This is option **B**.\n*   The other options, \"doublet of triplets\" and \"triplet of triplets,\" describe more complex splitting that is highly unlikely for a terminal aldehyde proton, which typically only shows significant coupling to its vicinal neighbors on Cα.\n*   Given that \"triplet\" is an option and it arises from the simple and chemically plausible scenario of having a methylene group (`-CH2-`) next to the aldehyde, this is the most logical conclusion. The structure of the precursors contained a `...-CH2-CH=CH-...` fragment, which leads to a `...-CH2-CHO` fragment in the final product.\n\n**Final Answer:** The most deshielded proton is the aldehyde proton. It is adjacent to a CH2 group (n=2). Therefore, its signal is split into a triplet.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step deduction of the structures of three products, followed by an analysis of the NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH. The adamantane cage (C10H16) is a tricyclic structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is C10H14Br2.\n*   **Conditions:** High temperature (240°C) and strong base (KOH) are known to cause complex rearrangements, especially in strained polycyclic systems. Eliminations from bridgehead positions, which are disfavored by Bredt's rule under normal conditions, can be forced or the molecule can rearrange to alleviate strain.\n*   **Spectroscopic Data of Product 1:**\n    *   **Formula:** The reaction involves the loss of two bromine atoms and the gain of one oxygen atom (from KOH or water). The initial C10H14 hydrocarbon skeleton remains, so the formula for Product 1 is C10H14O.\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** A peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), typically a ketone in a six-membered ring or a similarly strained environment. This frequency indicates the ketone is likely **not** conjugated with a double bond (an α,β-unsaturated ketone would absorb at a lower frequency, ~1680 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   4.79 ppm (2H): This signal is in the vinylic region, indicating a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The integration of 2H and the single signal suggest a symmetrical `–CH=CH–` group.\n        *   The remaining 12 protons are in the aliphatic region (2.41-2.23 ppm and 1.94 ppm), consistent with a polycyclic structure.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** Product 1 is a C10H14O molecule that contains both a non-conjugated ketone group and a symmetrically substituted C=C double bond. This requires that the original adamantane skeleton has undergone a rearrangement to a new, likely bicyclic or tricyclic, framework.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)3.\n*   **Transformation:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols. Importantly, it does not typically affect isolated carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) in Product 1 is reduced to a secondary alcohol group (–CHOH). The C=C double bond remains intact. Therefore, Product 2 is an unsaturated alcohol with the same carbon skeleton as Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O3) at low temperature, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Transformation:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. This reaction cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. When a C=C bond within a ring is cleaved, the ring opens. The `–CH=CH–` group is converted into two aldehyde groups (`–CHO`).\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** The C=C bond in the cyclic structure of Product 2 is cleaved, opening up one of the rings. The two carbons of the original double bond are converted into aldehyde carbons. Product 3 is therefore a monocyclic molecule containing two aldehyde groups and the alcohol group that was formed in Step 2.\n\n**Step 4: NMR Coupling Pattern of the Most Deshielded Proton in Product 3**\n\n*   **Identifying the Proton:** In Product 3 (a dialdehyde-alcohol), the most deshielded protons (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton) are the aldehyde protons (R–CHO). These protons typically have a chemical shift (δ) between 9 and 10 ppm.\n*   **Applying the n+1 Rule:** The splitting pattern (multiplicity) of a proton signal is determined by the number of adjacent protons (`n`) according to the `n+1` rule. We need to determine the number of protons on the carbon atom alpha (adjacent) to the aldehyde group (`-CαHn–CHO`).\n*   **Deducing the Local Structure:** The options provided for the coupling pattern are:\n    *   A) doublet of triplets\n    *   B) triplet\n    *   C) pentet\n    *   D) triplet of triplets\n\n    Let's consider what each simple pattern implies for `n`:\n    *   A singlet would mean n=0 (no adjacent protons, Cα is quaternary).\n    *   A doublet would mean n=1 (Cα is a methine group, –CH).\n    *   A **triplet** would mean n=2 (Cα is a methylene group, –CH2).\n    *   A quartet would mean n=3 (Cα is a methyl group, –CH3).\n\n*   Of the choices, \"triplet\" is the simplest and most common splitting pattern for an aldehyde other than a singlet or doublet. It arises from the aldehyde being bonded to a –CH2– group. The other options imply more complex splitting environments that are less likely. For the aldehyde proton signal to be a triplet, the structural fragment in Product 3 must be **–CH2–CHO**.\n\n*   **Working Backwards:** If Product 3 has a `–CH2–CHO` fragment, it must have been formed by the ozonolysis of a `–CH2–CH=CH–` fragment in Product 2. This is a very common structural motif in cyclic alkenes. Given that this is the most straightforward interpretation that matches one of the answers, it is the most logical conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in Product 3 is the aldehyde proton. Based on the likely structure formed from the reaction sequence and the provided options, this proton is adjacent to a CH2 group. According to the n+1 rule, having 2 adjacent protons (n=2) will split the signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 3 peaks).\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2), a tricyclic molecule. It is reacted with excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C).\n*   **Conditions:** These harsh basic and thermal conditions suggest that complex elimination and rearrangement reactions will occur. Reactions at bridgehead positions, normally disfavored, can be forced or the molecule can rearrange to a more stable or reactive intermediate.\n*   **Spectroscopic Data of Product 1:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** There is a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. This frequency is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O) of a ketone, particularly one within a saturated ring system like a cyclohexanone. It indicates the ketone is **not** conjugated with a double bond (an α,β-unsaturated ketone would absorb at a lower frequency, approx. 1670-1690 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   A signal at 4.79 ppm with an integration of 2H is observed. This chemical shift is in the vinylic region, confirming the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The integration of 2H for a single signal implies a symmetrical `–CH=CH–` group.\n        *   The remaining 12 protons are in the aliphatic region (2.41-2.23 ppm and 1.94 ppm), consistent with the rest of the polycyclic framework.\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** The reaction starts with C10H14Br2 and produces a product with 14 hydrogens and an oxygen atom (from KOH/H₂O). The molecular formula of Product 1 is C10H14O.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** Product 1 is a molecule with the formula C10H14O. It contains a non-conjugated ketone group and a symmetrical carbon-carbon double bond. For this to be possible, the original tricyclic adamantane skeleton must have rearranged, likely into a bicyclic structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide [Al(O-iPr)3].\n*   **Transformation:** This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which is a highly selective method for reducing aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols. Importantly, it does not affect isolated C=C double bonds.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) in Product 1 is reduced to a secondary alcohol group (–CHOH). The `–CH=CH–` double bond remains intact. Product 2 is therefore a bicyclic unsaturated alcohol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Transformation:** This two-step process is an ozonolysis reaction. Ozonolysis cleaves C=C double bonds. Since the double bond in Product 2 was part of a ring system, this cleavage opens the ring. The reductive workup with DMS converts the two carbons of the original `–CH=CH–` group into two aldehyde groups (`–CHO`).\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** Product 3 is a **monocyclic dialdehyde-alcohol**. It is a C10 molecule containing two aldehyde groups and one alcohol group.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in Product 3**\n\n*   **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:** In a molecule containing alcohol (`–CHOH`), and aldehyde (`–CHO`) groups, the aldehyde protons are by far the most deshielded (highest chemical shift, typically δ = 9-10 ppm). The question asks to exclude exchangeable protons, such as the alcohol's `–OH` proton.\n*   **Applying the n+1 Rule:** The splitting pattern (multiplicity) of a proton's NMR signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (`n`). The signal is split into `n+1` peaks. For the aldehyde proton, we need to know how many protons are on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon).\n*   **Deducing the Structure and Coupling:** The aldehyde groups in Product 3 are formed from the carbons of the original `–CH=CH–` double bond. The structure adjacent to the aldehyde group in Product 3 must be `–Cα–CHO`, where Cα was the carbon atom adjacent to the double bond in the precursor, Product 2. Let's analyze the expected splitting based on the number of protons on Cα.\n    *   If Cα has 0 protons (is quaternary): the aldehyde signal would be a singlet (n=0, 0+1=1 peak).\n    *   If Cα has 1 proton (is a methine, –CH–): the aldehyde signal would be a doublet (n=1, 1+1=2 peaks).\n    *   If Cα has 2 protons (is a methylene, –CH₂–): the aldehyde signal would be a **triplet** (n=2, 2+1=3 peaks).\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:** Among the given choices, \"triplet\" is a simple, common splitting pattern that directly corresponds to the aldehyde group being attached to a methylene (–CH₂–) group. The other options are either impossible (\"pentet\" is not a possible splitting for an aldehyde proton based on coupling to its α-carbon) or describe a more complex situation that is less likely. The formation of a `–CH₂–CHO` fragment from the ozonolysis of a `–CH₂–CH=CH–` unit is a very common and stable structural arrangement in cyclic alkenes. This is the most logical interpretation.\n\nTherefore, the most deshielded proton (the aldehyde proton) is coupled to two adjacent protons on a –CH₂– group, resulting in a triplet signal.\n\n<<<B>>>",

The fact that both protons appear at the same chemical shift means the double bond is symmetrically substituted, like `–CH=CH–`.\n        *   The other signals are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to the rest of the C10 hydrocarbon framework.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** The reaction causes the adamantane skeleton to rearrange, losing the two bromine atoms and incorporating one oxygen atom to form Product 1 (molecular formula C10H14O). This product contains two key functional groups: a non-conjugated ketone and a symmetrical C=C double bond.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction to form Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide [Al(O-iPr)₃].\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction.\n*   **Transformation:** The MPV reduction is a selective method for reducing ketones and aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols.

It is a C10 molecule that contains two aldehyde groups and the one alcohol group from the previous step.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the NMR coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton in Product 3**\n\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In a molecule like Product 3 (a dialdehyde-alcohol), the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons are the **aldehyde protons (–CHO)**.

The signal is split into `n+1` peaks. For the aldehyde proton, we need to know how many protons (`n`) are on the adjacent carbon atom (the α-carbon).\n*   **Analyze the Structure:** The fragment we are interested in is `–CαHn–CHO`.\n    *   The ozonolysis reaction cleaved a `...–CαHn–CH=CH–...` fragment in Product 2 to form `...–CαHn–CHO`.\n    *   Let's consider the possible splitting patterns based on the value of `n`:\n        *   If n=0 (no protons on Cα), the signal is a singlet. (Not an option)\n        *   If n=1 (one proton on Cα), the signal is a doublet. (Not an option)\n        *   If n=2 (two protons on Cα), the signal is a **triplet**. (This is option B).\n*   **Conclusion:** A triplet is a very common splitting pattern for an aldehyde, occurring when it is attached to a methylene (–CH₂–) group. This is a chemically reasonable structure to form from the starting material and reaction sequence. The other options (doublet of triplets, pentet, triplet of triplets) imply a more complex environment that is less likely for an aldehyde proton. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the aldehyde protons are coupled to an adjacent –CH₂– group.\n\nFollowing the n+1 rule, with n=2 adjacent protons, the signal for the aldehyde proton will be split into a 2+1 = 3 peak pattern, which is a **triplet**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
