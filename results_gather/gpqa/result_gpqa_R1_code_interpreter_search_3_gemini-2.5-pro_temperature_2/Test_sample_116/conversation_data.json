    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The user wants to identify which of the four given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n2.  **Define Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) is a common cause of chirality. Another cause is atropisomerism, which arises from restricted rotation around a single bond, often seen in substituted biphenyls.\n\n3.  **Examine each compound:**\n\n    *   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n        *   **Structure Identification:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The name indicates two phenyl rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. There are two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6', and two dimethyl dicarboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** The positions 2, 2', 6, and 6' are called ortho positions. These positions are substituted with large, bulky groups (-NO2 and -COOCH3). The steric hindrance caused by these bulky groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central C-C single bond. This restricted rotation (atropisomerism) locks the molecule into a specific non-planar conformation. Because the substitution pattern (substituents at 2,2' are the same, and substituents at 6,6' are the same, but the substituents at 2 and 6 are different), the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   **Structure Identification:** The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** We look for a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bearing the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since this carbon atom is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and it exhibits optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers, R and S).\n\n    *   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n        *   **Structure Identification:** The structure is (C6H5)2CO, which is a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** There are no sp3-hybridized carbons with four different substituents, so there is no chiral center. We must check for overall molecular symmetry. The molecule can adopt a conformation that possesses a plane of symmetry passing through the C=O bond and bisecting the molecule. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n        *   **Structure Identification:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two -COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry which is the plane of the molecule itself. It also possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. (Note: It does exhibit *geometric isomerism*, its cis-isomer being dimethyl maleate, but the question specifically asks for *optical* isomerism).\n\n4.  **Final Summary & Option Selection:**\n    *   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   Therefore, the correct combination is compounds 1 and 2. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality (atropisomerism). A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and cannot be optically active. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond. The positions ortho to the central bond (2, 2', 6, 6') are substituted with bulky groups: two dimethyl dicarboxylate groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The large size of these ortho-substituents prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the C1-C1' single bond. This restricted rotation is known as atropisomerism. Because the substitution pattern makes the molecule asymmetric (it lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion), it is chiral. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to check for a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to:\n        1.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n        2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n        4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and thus it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. It has a central carbonyl group attached to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule has a C₂ axis of symmetry passing through the carbon-oxygen double bond. While the two phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane to minimize steric hindrance, the molecule's mirror image is still superimposable on the original. It is an achiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is planar with the two ester groups (-COOCH₃) on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Being a planar molecule, it possesses a plane of symmetry coinciding with the plane of the molecule itself. It also has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not. Therefore, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An analysis of the compounds for chirality, the property that leads to optical isomerism, provides the following conclusions:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The presence of bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four positions ortho to the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') causes significant steric hindrance. This hindrance restricts free rotation around the central single bond, locking the molecule into a non-planar, twisted conformation. Since the substitution pattern does not allow for a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, the molecule is chiral. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound's structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. To determine if it is chiral, we look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to:\n    *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and thus exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure of benzophenone is a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings (C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅). The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. It possesses an axis of symmetry passing through the C=O bond, and it is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar. It possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An analysis of each compound for chirality (the necessary condition for optical isomerism) is as follows:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl.

The carbon atom at the second position is bonded to four different groups: a methyl group (-CH₃), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a chiral center. Molecules with a chiral center are chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This molecule is symmetrical. It has no chiral centers, and it is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an ester of butenedioic acid.

    "Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules, which are molecules that are non-superimposable on their mirror images. This property most commonly arises from either a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or from restricted rotation around a bond (axial chirality or atropisomerism). Let's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The substituents at all four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are large and bulky (-COOCH₃ and -NO₂). This steric hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central carbon-carbon single bond. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule non-planar and chiral, as it lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom in the chain is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    An atom bonded to four distinct groups is a chiral center. Molecules containing a chiral center are chiral (unless they are a meso compound, which is not the case here). Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. The molecule has no chiral centers. It possesses a twofold axis of symmetry passing through the carbonyl group and is superimposable on its mirror image. It is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. The molecule is planar. Due to its planarity, it has a plane of symmetry. It also possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.
