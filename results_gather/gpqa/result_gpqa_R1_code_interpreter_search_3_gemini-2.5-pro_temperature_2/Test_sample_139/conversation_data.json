    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clue about Melting Point:** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. Let's convert this to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This temperature is significantly different from the melting point of regular water (H₂O), which is 0 °C (273.15 K). However, it is almost exactly the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. Therefore, substance **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Producing B:** Substance G is a precipitate which, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of the thermal decomposition of a deuterated metal hydroxide, such as M(OD)ₓ. The reaction is: `2M(OD)ₓ(s) → M₂Oₓ(s) + x D₂O(g)`. This implies that substance G is a deuterated metal hydroxide.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Main Reaction:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, producing gas W and precipitate G.\n    *   Since G is a deuterated compound (M(OD)ₓ) and it releases D₂O, the reactants must contain deuterium (D). Substance X is known to incorporate a \"heavier isotope\", and since D₂O is involved, this isotope is deuterium.\n    *   It is most logical to assume that liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O), which reacts with X to form the deuterated products.\n    *   So, the reaction is: **X + Y(D₂O) → W(gas) + G(precipitate)**.\n\n4.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W has a molecule containing the same number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Given that X is a deuterated compound reacting with D₂O, a likely gaseous product is deuterium gas, D₂.\n    *   Let's check the proton and neutron count for D₂. A deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. So, **W is D₂**.\n\n5.  **Identify Substance X:** We have the following information about X:\n    *   It contains deuterium (D).\n    *   It's a reagent in organic chemistry with a very close analog.\n    *   It's a very strong reducing agent. This is deduced from the clue: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (general formula R-CO-COOH) contains at least 3 oxygen atoms. A standard reduction yields an α-hydroxy acid (R-CH(OH)-COOH), which also has 3 oxygen atoms. To get a product with only 2 oxygens, both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups must be reduced (e.g., to a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which requires a very potent reducing agent.\n    *   The most common powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry are lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). LiAlH₄ is much stronger than NaBH₄ and is capable of reducing carboxylic acids. NaBH₄ is not.\n    *   Therefore, the \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄, and Substance X must be its deuterated form: **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n6.  **Verify LiAlD₄ against all clues:**\n    *   **Formula:** LiAlD₄. Contains a heavier isotope (D).\n    *   **Reaction with Y (D₂O):** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g)`\n    *   This reaction is violent. It produces gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G (Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃), as LiOD is soluble.\n    *   **Heating G:** `2Al(OD)₃(s) --(heat)--> Al₂O₃(s) + 3D₂O(g)`. This releases substance B (D₂O).\n    *   All clues are consistent with **X = LiAlD₄**.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The formula for Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The question asks for the sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule. We will use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved, as the answer options are integers.\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** The isotope is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of 2. There are four deuterium atoms in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Cumulative mass of the lightest element = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** The most stable and common isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27. There is one aluminum atom in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Cumulative mass of the heaviest element = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Total Cumulative Mass:** Sum = (Mass from H) + (Mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants me to identify a substance, X, based on a series of chemical properties and reactions, and then perform a calculation based on its composition.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is close to 277 K. Converting this to Celsius gives `277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C`. The melting point of standard water (H₂O) is 0 °C. However, the melting point of heavy water (D₂O, where D is deuterium, the ²H isotope) is 3.82 °C. This is a very close match. Therefore, **Substance B is heavy water, D₂O.**\n\n2.  **Identify Substance G and its decomposition:** Substance G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of the thermal decomposition of a deuterated metal hydroxide, which breaks down into a metal oxide and heavy water. The general reaction is `2 M(OD)n(s) → M₂On(s) + n D₂O(g)`. So, G is a deuterated metal hydroxide.\n\n3.  **Analyze the main reaction:** \"Substance X...reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W...and a precipitate G forms\".\n    *   Since the products (G and subsequently B) contain deuterium (D), the deuterium must originate from the reactants, X and/or Y.\n    *   Substance X is known for incorporating a \"heavier isotope\". Since we've identified D₂O, this heavier isotope is deuterium (D).\n    *   Violent reactions between a substance and a liquid that produce a gas are often reactions of active metals or metal hydrides with water. Given the context, it is logical to assume that the liquid **Y is heavy water, D₂O.**\n\n4.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W's molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's test some simple gaseous molecules.\n    *   Hydrogen (H₂): A molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. (Incorrect)\n    *   Deuterium (D₂, or ²H₂): A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule, therefore, has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, **Gas W is deuterium gas, D₂.**\n\n5.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   The reaction is now: `X + D₂O → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate)`. This confirms X is a deuterated compound and a powerful reducing agent.\n    *   Clue: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" Powerful reducing hydrides are common in organic chemistry.\n    *   Clue: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. To reduce it to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms (e.g., a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), you need a very powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is such a reagent, while the less reactive sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is not.\n    *   Therefore, the \"very close analog\" is **LiAlH₄**. This means substance **X is the deuterated version, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Verify the full reaction:**\n    *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD (soluble) + 4D₂ (W)`.\n    *   This reaction is famously violent. It produces a gas, D₂ (W), and a gelatinous precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide Al(OD)₃ (G). The LiOD remains dissolved in the excess D₂O. This perfectly matches the description.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1). It is present as 4 atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al, Z=13). It is present as 1 atom. The mass number of its most common isotope is 27.\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements. We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two types.\n    *   Mass from lightest element (Deuterium): `4 atoms * 2 amu/atom = 8 amu`.\n    *   Mass from heaviest element (Aluminum): `1 atom * 27 amu/atom = 27 amu`.\n    *   Total cumulative mass = `8 + 27 = 35`.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the physical properties of Substance B.**\n    The melting point of substance B is given as \"very close to 277 K\". Converting Kelvin to Celsius:\n    Temperature (°C) = Temperature (K) - 273.15\n    Temperature (°C) = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This melting point is significantly different from that of ordinary water (H₂O), which is 0 °C. However, it is almost identical to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O, where D is the isotope deuterium, ²H), which is 3.82 °C. This is a strong indicator that **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Deduce the identity of Substance G and the nature of the reaction.**\n    Substance G is a precipitate which, upon heating, releases B (D₂O). This is a characteristic thermal decomposition reaction of a deuterated metal hydroxide, which breaks down to form a metal oxide and heavy water. The general form of this reaction is `M(OD)ₓ → Metal Oxide + x D₂O`. Thus, **Substance G is a deuterated metal hydroxide.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the reaction that forms G and W.**\n    Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, producing gas W and precipitate G (the deuterated hydroxide). Since the product G contains deuterium (D), the reactants (X and/or Y) must also contain deuterium. We are told X contains a \"heavier isotope,\" which we can now identify as deuterium. The reaction with a liquid Y to form a deuterated hydroxide strongly suggests that **liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.** The reaction is `X + D₂O → W (gas) + G (precipitate)`.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify Gas W.**\n    The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\" Let's examine potential candidates, keeping in mind that the reaction involves deuterium.\n    *   Consider deuterium gas (D₂). A single deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons.\n    This perfectly fits the description. The violent reaction of a substance with heavy water producing a gas strongly points to the evolution of hydrogen (in this case, deuterium gas). Thus, **W is D₂.**\n\n*   **Step 5: Identify Substance X.**\n    We have gathered the following clues about Substance X:\n    *   It contains deuterium (LiAlD₄).\n    *   Its non-deuterated analog is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n    *   It is a very powerful reducing agent, as shown by the clue: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (general formula R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. Reducing a keto acid to a product with only 2 oxygens (for example, a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH) requires the reduction of both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups. This type of reduction requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   The most powerful common hydride reducing agent used in organic chemistry capable of this transformation is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" is itself, and its deuterated version is Substance X.\n    Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, LiAlD₄.**\n\n*   **Step 6: Verify the entire process with X = LiAlD₄.**\n    The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD (soluble) + 4 D₂ (W)`\n    *   The reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   It produces a gas, D₂ (W).\n    *   It produces a precipitate, Al(OD)₃ (G).\n    *   When heated, the precipitate G decomposes: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`.\n    All the clues are consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Step 7: Perform the final calculation.**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D, Z=1).\n    *   The lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen.\n    *   The heaviest element by atomic number is Aluminum.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers for the specific isotopes present.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Aluminum. Its common isotope is ²⁷Al. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative atomic mass = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from D) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step deduction of the identities of substances X, Y, W, G, and B based on the provided chemical properties and reactions.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of Substance B is given as \"very close to 277 K\". Let's convert this to degrees Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. While the melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C, the melting point of heavy water (D₂O, where D is the isotope deuterium) is 3.82 °C. This is an excellent match. Therefore, **Substance B is heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the formation of B from G:** Substance G is a precipitate that releases B (D₂O) when heated. This is a classic thermal decomposition reaction of a deuterated metal hydroxide, which breaks down to a metal oxide and heavy water. This implies that **Substance G is a deuterated metal hydroxide** (of the form M(OD)ₓ).\n\n3.  **Analyze the main reaction:** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W ... and a precipitate G forms\".\n    *   Since the products involve deuterium (in G and B), the reactants must contain this isotope.

It is therefore highly probable that **liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.**\n\n4.  **Identify Gas W:** We are told that a molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's check the most likely gaseous product. The reaction of a deuteride with heavy water releases deuterium gas.\n    *   A deuterium atom (D, or ²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A deuterium gas molecule (D₂) therefore contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   Since the number of protons (2) equals the number of neutrons (2), **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n5.  **Identify Substance X:** We have several crucial clues for X:\n    *   It contains deuterium.\n    *   Its \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\".\n    *   It's a very potent reducing agent. This is deduced from the clue: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (general formula R-C(=O)-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms.

This requires a much stronger reducing agent than, for example, sodium borohydride (NaBH₄).

    "Based on the detailed chemical clues provided, let's deduce the identity of Substance X step-by-step and then perform the required calculation.\n\n1.  **Identifying Substance B:** The first crucial clue is the melting point of Substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius: `277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C`. This value is nearly identical to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C, and significantly different from that of regular water (H₂O), which is 0 °C.

The clue \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\" implies the reduction of both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group (since a keto acid like pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH, contains 3 oxygens). This level of reduction requires one of the most powerful hydride reagents.\n    *   The most famous strong reducing agent fitting this description is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   Therefore, its deuterated analog, Substance X, must be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n6.  **Verifying the Chemistry:** The reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O is:\n    `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃(s) (G) + LiOD(aq) + 4D₂(g) (W)`\n    This reaction is famously violent, produces a gas (W=D₂), and forms a gelatinous precipitate (G=Al(OD)₃), fully consistent with all the problem's statements.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄), using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen.
