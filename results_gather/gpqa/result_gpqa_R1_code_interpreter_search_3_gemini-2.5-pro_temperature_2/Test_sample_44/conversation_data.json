    "*   **1. Understand the Basics**\n    *   **System**: We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Being spin-1/2 particles, they are fermions. The key property of identical fermions is that they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**.\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: No two identical fermions can occupy the same single-particle quantum state. For an electron in a potential well, a state is defined by its energy level (principal quantum number, `n`) and its spin projection (`m_s`). Since `m_s` can be +1/2 (spin-up, ↑) or -1/2 (spin-down, ↓), each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles.\n    *   **Energy Levels**: The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy for a single particle in such a well is given by:\n        E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\n        where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    *   **Energy Unit E**: The problem conveniently defines a base energy unit E = (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2). Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be simplified to:\n        E_n = n^2 * E\n        *   E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n        *   E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n        *   E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n        *   E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n        *   and so on.\n\n*   **2. Calculate the Ground State Energy**\n    *   To find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with our four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   The n=1 level can hold two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   The n=2 level can hold two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   This accommodates all four particles.\n    *   **Configuration**:\n        *   2 particles in the n=1 state (Energy = E_1 = 1E each)\n        *   2 particles in the n=2 state (Energy = E_2 = 4E each)\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy (E_ground)**:\n        E_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n*   **3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2 in the ground state) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n    *   **Configuration**:\n        *   2 particles remain in the n=1 state (Energy = E_1 = 1E each)\n        *   1 particle remains in the n=2 state (Energy = E_2 = 4E)\n        *   1 particle is promoted to the n=3 state (Energy = E_3 = 9E)\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited)**:\n        E_1st_excited = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n*   **4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n    *   **Ground state energy**: 10E\n    *   **First excited state energy**: 15E (from promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3).\n    *   Let's find the energies of other possible excited configurations:\n        *   **Possibility (a)**: Promote one particle from a lower level. Let's move a particle from n=1 to the next available level, n=3.\n            *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n            *   Energy = (1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**\n        *   **Possibility (b)**: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n            *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3.\n            *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E\n        *   **Possibility (c)**: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4 (instead of n=3).\n            *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n            *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E\n\n    *   Comparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n    *   **Total Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited)**: **18E**\n\n*   **5. Conclusion**\n    *   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
