    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq) of Planet1 and Planet2, which can be expressed as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n### **2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `A` is the planet's bond albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n### **3. Formulating the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe can write the equilibrium temperature for each planet:\n*   For Planet1: T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))\n*   For Planet2: T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A` is constant). When we take the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, these common terms cancel out:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a1)) * ((2 * a2) / R_star))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes. Our next step is to find the ratio a2 / a1.\n\n### **4. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n\nThe problem provides Doppler shift data, which we can use to determine the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude, `K`, for the star.\n\nThe formula relating the Doppler shift (`Δλ`) to radial velocity (`v_r`) is:\nv_r = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\n\nThe maximum value `v_r_max` is the RV semi-amplitude `K`.\n*   K1 = c * (Δλ_1 / λ₀)\n*   K2 = c * (Δλ_2 / λ₀)\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\nK1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude `K` of the star is also related to the planet's mass (`M_p`), the star's mass (`M_star`), and the semi-major axis (`a`). For a circular orbit and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_p << M_star`), the formula is:\n\nK ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nWhere `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n### **5. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\n\nWe need to find the ratio a2 / a1. Let's rearrange the formula for `K` to solve for `a`:\nK² ≈ M_p² * G / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow, let's form the ratio a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K2²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K1²)]\n\nThe terms `G` and `M_star` are the same for both systems and cancel out:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) / (M_p1² / K1²)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n### **6. Plugging in the Values**\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   Planet masses: M_p1 = 7 M_earth, M_p2 = 5 M_earth.\n    *   Ratio: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   Doppler shifts: Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å, Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å.\n    *   Ratio of RV amplitudes: K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow substitute these ratios into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n### **7. Final Calculation of the Temperature Ratio**\n\nNow we can compute the final temperature ratio using the result from Step 3:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nLet's convert this fraction to a decimal to compare with the options.\n```python\nprint(15 / 28)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_output>\nThe result is approximately 0.536. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which can be expressed as `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature `T_eq` of a planet is given by:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n    Where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `A` is the planet's bond albedo.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures:** We need to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`. Let's write the expression for each planet:\n    *   `T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))`\n    *   `T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))`\n\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both) and possess the same albedo (so `A1 = A2`). When we take the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, these common terms will cancel out:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a1)) * ((2 * a2) / R_star))`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\n    This simplification shows that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes. Our next task is to find `a2 / a1`.\n\n4.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** The problem provides Doppler shift data, which is used to calculate the star's radial velocity (RV) variation. The maximum Doppler shift corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the RV curve, denoted by `K`. The formula linking the shift `Δλ` and `K` is `K = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)`.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    `K1 / K2 = (c * Δλ_1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ_2 / λ_0) = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\n    The RV semi-amplitude `K` induced by a planet is also related to the masses of the planet (`M_p`) and star (`M_star`), and the semi-major axis (`a`). For a circular orbit and assuming `M_p << M_star`, the formula is:\n    `K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n    Where `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (`a2 / a1`):** We need to rearrange the formula for `K` to solve for `a`:\n    `K² ≈ M_p² * G / (M_star * a)`\n    `a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)`\n\n    Now we can form the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K2²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K1²)]`\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, `G` and `M_star` are constants that cancel out:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) / (M_p1² / K1²)`\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²`\n\n6.  **Substitute Given Values:**\n    *   Planet masses: `M_p1 = 7 M_earth`, `M_p2 = 5 M_earth`. The ratio `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`.\n    *   Doppler shifts: `Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å`, `Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å`. The ratio `K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`.\n\n    Now plug these ratios into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = (5/7)² * (3/4)²`\n    `a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)`\n    `a2 / a1 = 225 / 784`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Now we use the result from Step 3:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\n    To compare this with the given options, we'll convert the fraction to a decimal.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the final decimal value for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures.\n# The ratio is sqrt(a2/a1), which we found to be 15/28.\nratio = 15 / 28\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_output>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. This value corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",

    "This problem requires us to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets. Let's break down the steps to solve this.\n\n### **Step 1: The Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `A` is the albedo of the planet.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n### **Step 2: Simplify the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`. Let's write out the expressions for both planets:\n\n`T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))`\n`T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))`\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both) and have the same albedo (so `A_1 = A_2`). When we take the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, these common terms cancel out:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (2 * a_2 / R_star))`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\nThis key simplification shows that the ratio of the temperatures depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes. Our next task is to find `a_2 / a_1`.\n\n### **Step 3: Relate the Semi-Major Axis to the Given Data**\n\nWe can find the semi-major axis using the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude (`K`) of the star caused by an orbiting planet is related to the planet's mass (`M_p`), the star's mass (`M_star`), and the semi-major axis (`a`). For a circular orbit and assuming the planet's mass is much less than the star's mass (`M_p << M_star`), the formula is:\n\n`K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n\nLet's solve this for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\n`K^2 ≈ M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)`\n`a ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n\n`a_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_1^2)]`\n\nThe gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Ratios of Mass and RV Semi-Amplitude**\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of the planet masses from the given data:\n*   `M_p1 = 7` Earth masses\n*   `M_p2 = 5` Earth masses\n*   `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n\nNext, let's find the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes (`K`). The value of `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (`Δλ`) because `K = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)`, where `c` and `λ_0` are constants for both planets. Therefore, the ratio `K_1 / K_2` is equal to the ratio `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n*   `Δλ_1 = 0.03` Å\n*   `Δλ_2 = 0.04` Å\n*   `K_1 / K_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Final Ratio**\n\nNow we substitute these ratios back into our equations.\n\n1.  **Calculate `a_2 / a_1`:**\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784`\n\n2.  **Calculate the temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`:**\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\nTo compare this fraction with the options, let's convert it to a decimal.\n```python\nprint(15 / 28)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_output>\nThe result is approximately 0.536.
