    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nTo determine if a compound is optically active, we need to assess its chirality. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. If a molecule is chiral, it will be optically active. An achiral molecule is optically inactive.\n\nThe most common indicators of chirality are:\n1.  **Presence of chiral centers (stereocenters):** A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Absence of symmetry elements:** A molecule with a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i) is achiral, even if it contains chiral centers. Such compounds are called meso compounds.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** Cl-CH=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to look for chiral centers (a carbon with four different substituents).\n        *   C1 is sp² hybridized (part of a C=C double bond), so it cannot be a chiral center.\n        *   C2 is also sp² hybridized and cannot be a chiral center.\n        *   The carbons in the methyl and ethyl groups are not bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. Furthermore, the molecule itself is planar around the double bond, and this plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a very complex name, but we can deduce its properties from the stereochemical descriptors. The name indicates specific stereochemistry at positions 3a and 7a, which are (R) and (S) respectively.\n    *   A compound with stereocenters having opposite configurations (one R, one S) is often a meso compound if the rest of the molecule is symmetric with respect to these centers. The core structure is a derivative of a bridged bicyclic system (norbornane-type). Let's assume the core `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione` corresponds to `endo-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride`, which has a plane of symmetry and is a meso compound. The stereocenters corresponding to 3a and 7a would be equivalent by symmetry.\n    *   The substituent is `8-(chloromethylene)`, which is `=CHCl` attached to the bridging carbon (C7 of norbornane, or C8 in this nomenclature). The `E` descriptor refers to the geometry at this double bond. This substituent group, `C=CHCl`, is itself planar. If it is attached to the bridge of the symmetric core, the plane of symmetry of the core that contains the bridge carbon atom is preserved.\n    *   The `(3aR, 7aS)` designation on a symmetric backbone strongly suggests a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral (a meso compound) and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. It has two chiral centers, at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** We are given the (2R, 3S) stereoisomer. Let's draw its Fischer projection.\n        ```\n          COOH\n          |\n      H --|-- CH₃  (C2)\n          |\n      H --|-- CH₃  (C3)\n          |\n          COOH\n        ```\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. The top half is the mirror image of the bottom half. This is a classic example of a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral (meso) and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. Again, two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the (2R, 3R) diastereomer. Let's draw its Fischer projection.\n        ```\n          COOH\n          |\n      H --|-- CH₃  (C2)\n          |\n      CH₃--|-- H   (C3)\n          |\n          COOH\n        ```\n    *   This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral. Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer, and they are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's check for chiral centers. C1 is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H\n        2.  -OH\n        3.  -CH₂- (C6 of the ring)\n        4.  -CH= (C2 of the ring)\n    *   To confirm C6 and C2 are part of different groups, we trace the path around the ring from C1. Path 1: -CH=CH-CH₂-CH₂-. Path 2: -CH₂-CH₂-CH=CH-. The paths are identical in atom sequence but different in bond type starting from C1. The groups attached to C1 are distinct. Thus, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name explicitly gives the (R) configuration, meaning this is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The molecule has no internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at C1, C3, and C5. The designation `(1s,3s,5s)` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups have the same relative configuration, meaning they are all on the same side of the ring (all cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's visualize the more stable chair conformation, where all three large -OH groups are in equatorial positions. This molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) perpendicular to the average plane of the ring. More importantly, it possesses three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H bond on the other side of the ring.\n    *   The presence of any plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** Based on IUPAC naming, the parent chain is butan-1-one with a methyl group at C3. A cyclopentyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon (C1). The structure is: (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂.\n    *   **Analysis:** We search for chiral centers.\n        *   Cyclopentyl ring: Contains only CH₂ groups, so no chiral centers.\n        *   Carbonyl carbon: sp², not chiral.\n        *   -CH₂- group: not chiral.\n        *   -CH(CH₃)₂ group: The carbon is bonded to H, two identical CH₃ groups, and the rest of the molecule. Since it's bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and is achiral. It can adopt conformations that possess a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** Inactive\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-...-dione:** Inactive (meso)\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** Inactive (meso)\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** **Active**\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** **Active**\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** Inactive\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** Inactive\n\nThere are two compounds that will exhibit optical activity: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid and (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of a single chiral center guarantees chirality. Molecules with multiple chiral centers can be achiral if they have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion; these are called meso compounds.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is Cl-CH=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). The two carbons involved in the double bond are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. There are no other carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the double bond). Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This molecule has two stereocenters, at positions 3a and 7a. The core structure is a bridged bicyclic system that is symmetric. The stereochemical descriptors are (R) and (S) for the two bridgehead carbons to which the anhydride ring is fused. An (R,S) combination on a symmetric molecule often results in a meso compound. This molecule possesses an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. In the (2R,3S) isomer, there is a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. This is a classic example of a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral. Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is the diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 (C1), which bears the hydroxyl group, is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a vinyl group within the ring (-CH=CH-), and an alkyl group within the ring (-CH₂-CH₂-). Thus, C1 is a chiral center. The (R) designation indicates that we are considering a specific enantiomer. Since the molecule is chiral, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has three hydroxyl groups, all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all cis). When the ring is in its chair conformation (with all three OH groups equatorial), the molecule has a C₃ axis of rotation and three vertical planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry contains one C-OH bond and bisects the opposite C-C bond. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. We need to check for any chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon is sp², so it's not chiral. The cyclopentyl ring has only CH₂ groups. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and a -CH₂C(=O)- group. Since it's bonded to two identical groups (CH₃), it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no chiral centers and is achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n*   Optically inactive: (3aR,7aS,E)-...-dione\n*   Optically inactive: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Optically active**: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Optically active**: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Optically inactive: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n*   Optically inactive: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are two compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An optically active compound is a chiral compound, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.
