    "Here's a detailed thinking process to solve this organic synthesis problem.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's draw the structure and analyze the substituent positions:\n*   The parent name is benzene.\n*   The substituents are:\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position C1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position C2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe substituents have the following directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho/para-director. It is very bulky.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe final molecule has a 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern. This is often challenging to synthesize directly because the directing effects of the groups can conflict. For example, if you have the 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene intermediate, both -OEt and -tBu are ortho/para directors. A subsequent nitration would preferentially occur at C4 or C6, not at C3. This suggests a more complex strategy is required, likely involving blocking groups or functional group interconversions.\n\n**2. Analyze the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nWe need to evaluate each option (A, B, C, D) to see if it leads to the desired product in high yield.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitrobenzene.\n    ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl -> Aniline.\n    iii) Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> ???\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). Friedel-Crafts reactions (like this alkylation) do not work on rings with strongly deactivating groups. The lone pair on the nitrogen of aniline acts as a Lewis base and complexes with the AlCl3 catalyst, forming a highly deactivating anilinium-like species (-NH2+-AlCl3), which prevents the reaction. So, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n    ii) tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitration. The t-Bu group is an o,p-director, but because it's so bulky, nitration heavily favors the para position. The major product would be **p-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n    The target molecule has the t-Bu group and the NO2 group ortho to each other (at C2 and C3, relative to OEt at C1). This synthesis route starts by placing them para to each other. It's very difficult to rearrange this para relationship to the required ortho/meta relationship. Therefore, this sequence will not produce the desired product in high yield. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n    ii) tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> p-tert-butylnitrobenzene (as in Option B).\n    iii) p-tert-butylnitrobenzene + SO3/H2SO4 -> Sulfonation. This step is possible. Both t-Bu (o,p-director) and NO2 (m-director) would direct the sulfonation to the position ortho to the t-Bu group. This would form **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    iv) ... + NaNO2/HCl -> ???\n    Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction, which requires an aniline (a primary aromatic amine). The intermediate at step (iii) does not have an amino group. This step is impossible at this stage in the sequence. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    This option appears the most complex, but also the most plausible, as it employs a blocking group strategy, which is often necessary for complex substitution patterns.\n    i) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene.** (Standard start).\n    ii) **tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 -> p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** This is a key step. The bulky t-Bu group directs the sulfonation to the para position. This -SO3H group now \"blocks\" the para position, forcing subsequent substitutions elsewhere. The -SO3H group is also a meta-director and can be removed later (desulfonation).\n    iii) **p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.** In this step, the t-Bu group directs ortho (to C2) and the -SO3H group directs meta (also to C2). They cooperate to direct the nitration to the position ortho to the t-butyl group. This is an excellent way to force ortho substitution.\n    iv) **... + Fe/HCl -> 4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid.** This is a standard reduction of the nitro group to an amino group.\n    v) **... + NaNO2/HCl -> Diazotization.** The newly formed amino group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+). This is a versatile intermediate.\n    The subsequent steps in the listed sequence are convoluted and appear to contain a misplaced reaction (step vi). Let's deduce the necessary remaining steps from the list of reagents to transform the intermediate from step (iv) into the final product.\n    **Let's propose a logical sequence using the remaining reagents from Option C to achieve the synthesis of the target precursor, 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.**\n    This seems impossible with the reagents and intermediates generated. Let's reconsider the problem from a different viewpoint. The only viable strategy shown in any option is the blocking group strategy of option C. Let's trace it and see if we can find a plausible path even if the listed order seems strange.\n\n    **Re-evaluating the path for Option C:**\n    Let's assume the synthesis creates an aniline precursor that is then converted to the final product. Let's say we have successfully made `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline`. This can be converted to the target as follows:\n    1.  `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline` + `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization, step v)\n    2.  `...` + `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (hydrolysis of diazonium salt to phenol, step vii) -> `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`\n    3.  `...` + `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis, step ix) -> `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`.\n    This works. So, the problem reduces to synthesizing **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** using steps `i, ii, iii, iv, vi, viii`.\n    Let's try to build this aniline:\n    -   `i, ii, iii` gives `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    -   Here, `NO2` and `tBu` are *meta*. In our target aniline, they are *ortho*. This starting intermediate from step `iii` cannot lead to the target aniline.\n\n    Let's try one more time, carefully, as there might be a subtle point. What if the product of nitration of p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (step iii) is used as the final nitro group?\n    1.  i, ii, iii -> `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. This has the `tBu` and `NO2` in a meta relationship. We need them ortho in the final product. This pathway is incorrect.\n\n    **Conclusion by Elimination and Plausibility:**\n    Options A, B, and D contain fatal, indisputable flaws early in their sequences.\n    *   A: FC on aniline.\n    *   B: Wrong regiochemistry (para).\n    *   D: Wrong regiochemistry and impossible step (diazotization without an amine).\n\n    Option C presents the only chemically sound *strategy* for overcoming the regiochemical problem, by using a sulfonic acid blocking group to force an ortho-substitution that would otherwise be a minor product. While the sequence of transformations (steps iv through viii) seems convoluted or potentially erroneously ordered, the foundational strategy is correct. Given that the other three options are clearly incorrect based on fundamental principles, Option C must be the intended answer, even if the written sequence is imperfect. Such complex multi-step synthesis problems in a multiple-choice format often test the recognition of the key strategic step—in this case, the use of the -SO3H blocking group.\n\nFinal check: The core idea of blocking the para position of tert-butylbenzene with SO3H, then nitrating the ortho position is the most viable path towards an intermediate where the tert-butyl group is ortho to another functional group. No other option provides a path to this crucial arrangement. Therefore, C is the best answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a complex multi-step synthesis problem that requires a careful analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions and the directing effects of various substituents. The goal is to find the sequence that yields **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nLet's draw the structure and analyze the relationship between the substituents:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) is at position C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) is at position C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) is at position C3.\n\nThe key relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to synthesize directly due to competing directing effects.\n\n### **2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's evaluate each option step-by-step based on the principles of organic chemistry.\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n*   Step i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii) Reduction of nitrobenzene gives aniline.\n*   Step iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. **This step fails.** The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair of the amino group in aniline. This forms a complex (-NH2⁺-AlCl₃) which is a very strong deactivating group, preventing the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   Step i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene gives tert-butylbenzene.\n*   Step ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. However, due to its large steric bulk, it strongly directs the incoming nitro group to the **para** position. The major product is 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene.\n*   This sequence establishes a para relationship between the t-butyl and nitro groups. The final product requires them to be ortho. This regiochemical problem cannot be easily fixed in subsequent steps. Thus, Option B will not give a high yield of the desired product.\n\n**D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n*   This sequence also begins by forming 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (steps i and ii) and then proceeds to sulfonate it (step iii).\n*   Step iv) involves the use of NaNO2/HCl. This is a reagent used to convert a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺). The product after step iii is 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, which does not contain an amino group.\n*   Therefore, step iv is an impossible reaction for the given substrate. Thus, Option D is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\nThis sequence employs a more sophisticated strategy involving a blocking group.\n*   Step i) Benzene -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n*   Step ii) Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky t-Bu group directs the sulfonation to the less hindered **para** position, yielding **p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The -SO₃H group now \"blocks\" the para position. This is a key strategic step.\n*   Step iii) Nitration of p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   The t-Bu group is an ortho,para-director, but the para position is blocked by -SO₃H. So, it directs to the ortho position.\n    *   The -SO₃H group is a meta-director, which also directs to the position ortho to the t-Bu group.\n    *   Both groups work together to direct the incoming nitro group to the position **ortho to the tert-butyl group**. This is the only way to achieve this specific substitution with high yield. The product is **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. In this intermediate, the crucial ortho relationship between the t-butyl group and a new substituent is established.\n\nWhile the exact order and purpose of the subsequent listed steps (iv-ix) might seem confusing or contain typos (e.g., a second nitration at step vi), the initial strategy (steps i-iii) is the only one presented that can correctly install the substituents with the required regiochemistry, overcoming the normal directing effects. The rest of the steps would logically involve:\n*   Reduction of the nitro group to an amine (using `Fe/HCl`).\n*   Removal of the sulfonic acid blocking group (using `dilute H2SO4`).\n*   And functional group conversions via a diazonium salt (using `NaNO2/HCl` and `H3O+`) to install the hydroxyl group, followed by etherification (using `NaOH/EtBr`) to get the ethoxy group.\n\nBy elimination, and by recognizing the essential blocking group strategy that is unique to this option, Option C is the only plausible route.\n\n<<<C>>>",

Direct nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)ethoxybenzene would not work, as both -OEt and -tBu are ortho,para-directors and would direct a new substituent to positions 4 or 6, not position 3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's analyze the structure:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) is at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) is at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) is at position 3.\n\nThe key spatial relationships between the groups are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern is challenging to synthesize directly because the directing effects of the substituents often conflict. A simple, stepwise electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is unlikely to work.

Due to the steric hindrance of the t-butyl group, the sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) is directed to the **para** position. The product is **p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.

While the subsequent steps (iv-ix) might seem scrambled or contain typos (as is common in complex problems), the foundational strategy shown in steps (i), (ii), and (iii) is the only one that could lead to the correct family of isomers. The other options fail on fundamental principles. A plausible continuation would involve reduction of the nitro group, a second controlled nitration (using the amino group's directing effect, likely via an acetamide intermediate), removal of the sulfonic acid blocking group (desulfonation), and conversion of the amine to the ethoxy group via a diazonium salt. Option C contains all the necessary types of reagents for such a sequence.\n\nBy the process of elimination and by identifying the only valid synthetic strategy, Option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
