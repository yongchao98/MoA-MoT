    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:**\n    The problem describes a two-step radiative decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> (denoted as 3s) to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0> (the ground state, 1s). This decay occurs via an intermediate state. Since it involves two dipole transitions, there will be two emitted photons.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State using Selection Rules:**\n    Electric dipole (E1) transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers (n, l, m):\n    *   Δn = n_final - n_initial: can be any integer.\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1.\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1.\n\n    *   **First Transition (Decay from |3,0,0>):**\n        *   Initial state: |i> = |3, 0, 0>.\n        *   The change in orbital angular momentum must be Δl = ±1. Since l_initial = 0, the intermediate state must have l_intermediate = 1.\n        *   The decay must be to a lower energy state, so n_intermediate < 3. The most probable E1 transition is to the closest available energy level, which is n=2.\n        *   Thus, the intermediate state has n=2 and l=1. Let's call this state |2,1,m'>.\n        *   For the magnetic quantum number m, the selection rule is Δm = m_intermediate - m_initial = m' - 0 = 0, ±1. So, the possible values for m' are -1, 0, and +1.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n    *   **Second Transition (Decay from the intermediate state to |1,0,0>):**\n        *   Let the intermediate state be |2,1,m'>.\n        *   The final state is |f> = |1,0,0>.\n        *   Let's check the selection rules:\n            *   Δl = l_final - l_intermediate = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n            *   Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m'. This implies Δm must be 0 (if m'=0), -1 (if m'=1), or +1 (if m'=-1). All these possibilities are allowed by the selection rules.\n        *   So, all three states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> can decay to the final state |1,0,0>.\n\n3.  **Identify the Possible Decay Routes:**\n    Based on the selection rules, there are three possible cascade routes from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0>:\n    *   Route 1: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n    *   Route 2: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n    *   Route 3: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n    The options provided in the question correspond to these routes.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) for each Route:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route |i> → |k> → |f> is given by the product of the branching ratios for each step:\n    P(route) = BR(i → k) × BR(k → f)\n\n    *   **First Step Branching Ratio: BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>)**\n        The branching ratio for a decay to a specific final state |k> from an initial state |i> is the ratio of the partial decay rate to that state (Γ_{i→k}) to the total decay rate from the initial state (Γ_{i,total}).\n        The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (l=0). The interaction responsible for the decay (the electric dipole operator, averaged over all photon polarizations and emission directions) does not have a preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the available magnetic sublevels of the |2,1> state.\n        This means the transition rates Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) are equal for m' = -1, 0, and +1.\n        Let Γ_m' = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>). Then Γ_{-1} = Γ_{0} = Γ_{1}.\n        The total rate of decay from |3,0,0> to the |2,1> level is Γ_{total} = Γ_{-1} + Γ_{0} + Γ_{1} = 3Γ_{0}.\n        The branching ratio for decaying into a specific m' state is:\n        BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = Γ_{m'} / Γ_{total} = Γ_{0} / (3Γ_{0}) = 1/3.\n        So, the probability of the first step leading to any specific m' state is 1/3.\n\n    *   **Second Step Branching Ratio: BR(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>)**\n        The intermediate state is |2,1,m'> (a 2p state). We need to consider all possible E1 decays from this state. A decay must go to a lower energy state (n=1). In the n=1 shell, only l=0 is possible. The transition from l=1 to l=0 is allowed (Δl = -1). Therefore, the only possible E1 decay channel for the 2p state is to the 1s state, |1,0,0>.\n        Since this is the only possible decay route, its branching ratio is 1.\n        BR(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) = 1 for any m'.\n\n    *   **Total Probability for a Specific Route:**\n        The total probability for any one of the three specific routes is:\n        P(route) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    Let's check the options provided:\n    *   A) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> (Valid), Probability: 1/4 (Incorrect)\n    *   B) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> (Valid), Probability: 1/3 (Correct)\n    *   C) Route: >→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> (Valid, assuming start is |3,0,0>), Probability: 2/3 (Incorrect)\n    *   D) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> (Valid), Probability: 1/4 (Incorrect)\n\n    The only option that presents a valid route with the correct corresponding probability is B.\n\nUsing LaTeX for the final answer:\nThe allowed two-step dipole transition routes are |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,m'\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle where m' can be -1, 0, or 1. The probability for the atom to follow any of these specific routes is the same, calculated as the product of branching ratios.\nThe probability for the first step, going from the spherically symmetric |3,0,0\\rangle state to any of the three degenerate |2,1,m'\\rangle states, is \\frac{1}{3} for each m'. The second step, from |2,1,m'\\rangle to |1,0,0\\rangle, is the only E1 decay possible, so its probability (branching ratio) is 1.\nTherefore, the probability of the specific cascade |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle is \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem involves a two-step radiative decay in a hydrogen atom, from the state |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩ to |n=1, l=0, m=0⟩. The transitions are electric dipole transitions, which are governed by specific selection rules. We need to determine the correct intermediate state and the probability of that specific decay path.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions:**\n    The selection rules for the quantum numbers (n, l, m) are:\n    *   Δn = n_final - n_initial: can be any integer.\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1.\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1.\n\n2.  **Determine the intermediate state:**\n    The decay proceeds in two steps: |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.\n\n    *   **First transition:** From |i⟩ = |3,0,0⟩ to the intermediate state |k⟩ = |n',l',m'⟩.\n        *   Applying the Δl selection rule: Since l_initial = 0, the intermediate state must have l' = 1 (because Δl = 1-0 = +1).\n        *   For a decay, the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number must decrease: n' < 3. The options suggest the intermediate state has n'=2, which is allowed and the most probable destination for an E1 transition from n=3.\n        *   So, the intermediate state is of the form |2,1,m'⟩.\n        *   Applying the Δm selection rule: Δm = m' - m_initial = m' - 0 = m'. Since Δm can be 0, ±1, the possible values for m' are -1, 0, and +1.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** From the intermediate state |k⟩ = |2,1,m'⟩ to the final state |f⟩ = |1,0,0⟩.\n        *   Let's check if this is an allowed transition.\n        *   Δl = l_final - l'_intermediate = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   Δm = m_final - m'_intermediate = 0 - m'. This can be 0 (for m'=0), -1 (for m'=1), or +1 (for m'=-1). All these possibilities are allowed by the selection rules.\n        *   So, all three potential intermediate states can indeed decay to the final |1,0,0⟩ state.\n\n3.  **Calculate the probability of a specific decay route:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade, for example, |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the first step: P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩)**\n        The initial state, |3,0,0⟩ (a 3s state), is spherically symmetric. The electric dipole interaction, when averaged over all possible photon emission directions and polarizations, does not have a preferred direction in space. The three possible final states, |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩, are degenerate in energy in the absence of an external field. Consequently, the transition probability to each of these three sublevels is identical.\n        The only allowed E1 decay from the 3s state is to a 2p state (since for n=1, l=1 is not possible). So, the total probability of decay from 3s must be distributed among the available 2p states.\n        Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability of the atom decaying into any one *specific* m' state is 1/3.\n        Therefore, P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = 1/3.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the second step: P(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)**\n        The atom is now in a 2p state (|2,1,m'⟩). To decay, it must transition to a lower energy state, which is the n=1 level. The only state in the n=1 level is the 1s state, |1,0,0⟩. The transition 2p → 1s is an allowed E1 transition (as verified in step 2). Since this is the *only* possible E1 decay channel for the 2p state, the branching ratio for this transition is 1 (i.e., the probability is 100%).\n        Therefore, P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = 1.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total probability:**\n    The total probability for the cascade via the |2,1,0⟩ intermediate state is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    P(Total Route) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\n    P(Total Route) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) Route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ has a probability of 1/3, but the option says 1/4. Incorrect.\n    *   B) Route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ has a probability of 1/3. The option matches this.

    "This problem describes a two-step cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via electric dipole (E1) transitions, which are governed by specific selection rules. We must identify the valid intermediate state and calculate the probability of that specific decay path.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions:**\n    For an atom to undergo a transition by emitting a single photon (an E1 process), the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n = n_{final} - n_{initial}$, can be any integer.\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial}$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial}$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n\n2.  **Step 1: The first transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.**\n    *   **Change in l:** The initial state has $l=0$. According to the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   **Change in n:** The decay must be to a state of lower energy, so $n'$ must be less than 3. The options suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$, which is allowed and is the most probable E1 decay. So, the intermediate state is a $2p$ orbital.\n    *   **Change in m:** The initial state has $m=0$. The selection rule is $\\Delta m = m' - m = m' - 0 = m'$. Since $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the possible values for $m'$ in the intermediate state are $-1, 0, 1$.\n    *   This means the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Step 2: The second transition from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.**\n    *   We need to verify that this transition is allowed.\n    *   **Change in l:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l'_{intermediate} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   **Change in m:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m'_{intermediate} = 0 - m'$. This is allowed since for $m' = \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, the change $\\Delta m$ will be $\\{1, 0, -1\\}$, which satisfies the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   Therefore, all three possible intermediate states can decay to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an E1 transition. All the routes proposed in the options are physically possible.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of a specific route.**\n    We need to find the probability of one specific path, for instance, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$. The total probability of a cascade is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step: $P_1 = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle)$**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (it's an s-orbital). In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. The decay is mediated by the electric dipole operator. When averaged over all possible photon emission directions and polarizations, the transition probability is the same for each of the degenerate final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n        The 3s state can only decay via E1 to a 2p state (since there is no 1p state). Thus, the total probability of decay from 3s to 2p is 1 (or normalized to the total decay rate). This total probability is split equally among the three available final $m'$ sublevels.\n        Therefore, the probability of decaying to any *specific* sublevel is $1/3$.\n        So, $P_1 = 1/3$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step: $P_2 = P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$**\n        The atom is now in the state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ (a 2p orbital). For it to decay, it must move to a lower energy level. The only level below $n=2$ is the ground state $n=1$. The only state in the $n=1$ level is $|1,0,0\\rangle$. As we verified in point 3, the transition $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is an allowed E1 transition.\n        Since this is the *only* possible E1 decay channel for the $2p$ state, the probability of this transition occurring (its branching ratio) is 1.\n        So, $P_2 = 1$.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for the specific cascade $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is:\n        $P_{total} = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is a valid two-dipole transition route, and its associated probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches option B.\n    By the same logic, routes A and D are also valid routes, but their probabilities are also $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, options A and D are incorrect. Option C has the correct route but an incorrect probability.\n\nFinal Answer, formatted in LaTeX as requested:\nThe decay proceeds via the intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. Based on the dipole selection rules ($\\Delta l=\\pm 1, \\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$), a transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ must lead to a state with $l'=1$ (e.g., $|2,1,m'\\rangle$). The subsequent transition from $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is also an allowed dipole transition ($\\Delta l = -1$).\nThe route is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\nThe probability for the first step, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$, is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This is because the initial state is spherically symmetric, and the transition probability is equally distributed among the three possible final magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\nThe probability for the second step, $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, is $1$, as this is the only available E1 decay channel for the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state.\nThe total probability for this specific cascade is the product of the individual probabilities: $P = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires understanding the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions in a hydrogen atom and calculating the probability of a specific two-step decay path.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understand the Process:** The hydrogen atom starts in the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ and ends in the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.

This means there is an intermediate state.\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Dipole Transition 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Dipole Transition 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Recall Dipole Selection Rules:** Electric dipole (E1) transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers $(n, l, m)$:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), energy must be released, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State $|n', l', m'\\rangle$:**\n    *   **First Transition:** from $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n        *   **Change in l:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ to satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n        *   **Change in n:** The energy must decrease, so $n' < 3$. For a state with $l'=1$ to exist, we need $n' \\ge 2$. Thus, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n        *   **Change in m:** The initial state has $m=0$. For the intermediate state, $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = m'$. Since $\\Delta m$ can be $0, \\pm 1$, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle,$ and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** from $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   We must check if this step is allowed from the possible intermediate states identified above, i.e., from $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n        *   **Change in l:** The transition is from $l'=1$ to the final state's $l=0$. This gives $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n        *   **Change in m:** The transition is from $m'$ to the final state's $m=0$. This gives $\\Delta m = 0-m'$. Since $m'$ can be $-1,0,1$, $\\Delta m$ can be $1,0,-1$, which is also allowed.\n        *   Therefore, all the options listed (A, B, D) present physically valid decay routes.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route:**\n    Let's calculate the probability for the route specified in option B: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$. The total probability is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) for each step.\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 1: P($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$)**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. It can decay to any of the three degenerate $p$-orbitals of the $n=2$ level: $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle,$ and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state and the isotropic nature of the decay process (averaged over all emission directions), the probability of decaying into any of these three sublevels is equal. Since these are the only possible final states for the first step, the total probability is divided equally among them.\n        Therefore, the probability of decaying into the specific state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 2: P($|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$)**\n        The atom is now in the state $|2,1,0\\rangle$. The only energy level below $n=2$ is the $n=1$ level. The only state in the $n=1$ level is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The transition from $|2,1,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is an allowed E1 transition (as confirmed in step 3).

    "This problem requires analyzing a two-step radiative decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. The decay occurs through two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Understand Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:**\n    For a transition to occur via the emission of a single photon (an E1 process), the quantum numbers must change according to specific rules:\n    *   Change in principal quantum number ($\\Delta n$): Can be any integer, but for decay (emission), energy must decrease, so $n_{\\text{final}} < n_{\\text{initial}}$.\n    *   Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number ($\\Delta l$): $\\Delta l = l_{\\text{final}} - l_{\\text{initial}} = \\pm 1$.\n    *   Change in magnetic quantum number ($\\Delta m$): $\\Delta m = m_{\\text{final}} - m_{\\text{initial}} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow \\text{Intermediate State } |n', l', m'\\rangle$\n    *   The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (as $\\Delta l$ must be $\\pm 1$).\n    *   Applying the energy rule: The energy must decrease, so $n'<3$. For a state with $l'=1$ to exist, we must have $n' \\ge l'+1=2$. Thus, the only possible principal quantum number for the intermediate state is $n'=2$.\n    *   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: Since $m=0$, the change is $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = m'$. As $\\Delta m$ can be $0, \\pm 1$, the possible values for the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate state are $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, +1\\}$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are the three degenerate sublevels of the 2p orbital: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Transition:** $\\text{Intermediate State } |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow \\text{Final State } |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Let's check if this transition is allowed by the E1 selection rules.\n    *   The initial state for this step is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ and the final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Change in $l$: $\\Delta l = l_{\\text{final}} - l_{\\text{initial}} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   Change in $m$: $\\Delta m = m_{\\text{final}} - m_{\\text{initial}} = 0 - m'$. For $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, the change $\\Delta m$ will be in $\\{+1, 0, -1\\}$, which satisfies the rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   So, a transition from any of the three 2p intermediate states to the 1s ground state is allowed. This means all routes mentioned in options A, B, and D are physically possible.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of a Specific Decay Route:**\n    We need to find the probability (which corresponds to the branching ratio) of one specific path. Let's calculate it for the route given in option B: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step, P(1):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction for the atom to decay. The atom can decay to any of the three degenerate 2p sublevels ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$). The probability is distributed equally among these three possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of decaying into any *one specific* sublevel, such as $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is $1/3$.\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step, P(2):** The atom is now in the state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ (a 2p orbital). The only allowed E1 decay from the n=2 shell is to the n=1 shell (the ground state), as this is the only state with lower energy. As established in step 3, the transition to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state is allowed. Since this is the *only* available channel for E1 decay, its probability (branching ratio) is 1.\n        $P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$\n\n    *   **Total Probability:** The total probability for this cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each independent step:\n        $P_{\\text{total}} = P(1) \\times P(2) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability: The calculated probability is $1/3$, but the option gives $1/4$. Incorrect.\n    *   B) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability: The calculated probability is $1/3$, which matches the option. Correct.\n    *   C) Route: Missing initial state, but assuming $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability: The calculated probability is $1/3$, but the option gives $2/3$. Incorrect.\n    *   D) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability: The calculated probability is $1/3$, but the option gives $1/4$. Incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid decay path with the correct corresponding probability is B.\n\nFinal Answer, formatted in LaTeX as requested:\nThe transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is consistent with the electric dipole selection rules. The probability of the first step, from the spherically symmetric $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the specific $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state, is $\\frac{1}{3}$ due to the equal probability of transitioning to any of the three degenerate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states. The probability of the second step, from $|2,1,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$, is $1$ because this is the only available E1 decay channel. The total probability for this specific cascade is the product of these probabilities, which is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
