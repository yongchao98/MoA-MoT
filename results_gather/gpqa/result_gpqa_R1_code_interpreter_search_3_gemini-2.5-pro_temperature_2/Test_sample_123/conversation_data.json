    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Particle Decay**\n\nThe problem involves the decay of unstable particles. The number of particles, `N`, remaining after a time `t` from an initial population `N₀` follows the exponential decay law:\n\n`N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_mean)`\n\nwhere `τ_mean` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the frame of reference where time `t` is measured.\n\n**2. Apply Special Relativity Concepts**\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The particles are moving at relativistic speeds. According to the theory of special relativity, time for a moving particle passes slower relative to a stationary observer (the lab frame). The mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame (`τ'`) is dilated compared to its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime `τ`). The relationship is given by:\n\n    `τ' = γ * τ`\n\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n*   **Particle Travel Time:** The particles are created at the center of a spherical detector with a radius `L = 30 m`. They travel at an ultra-relativistic velocity `v`, so `v ≈ c` (the speed of light). The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall, as measured in the lab frame, is:\n\n    `t_lab = L / v ≈ L / c`\n\n**3. Set up the Equations for Both Scenarios**\n\nThe decay equation in the lab frame can be written by substituting the dilated lifetime `τ'` and the travel time `t_lab`:\n\n`N(t_lab) / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ') = exp(-(L/c) / (γτ))`\n\nThis equation gives the fraction of particles that survive the journey to the detector wall.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the wall, `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n\n`1/3 = exp(-(L/c) / (20 * τ))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n`ln(1/3) = -(L/c) / (20 * τ)`\n`-ln(3) = -(L/c) / (20 * τ)`\n`ln(3) = (L/c) / (20 * τ)`   (Equation 1)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?`\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the wall, `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n\n`2/3 = exp(-(L/c) / (γ₂ * τ))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n`ln(2/3) = -(L/c) / (γ₂ * τ)`\n`-ln(3/2) = -(L/c) / (γ₂ * τ)`\n`ln(3/2) = (L/c) / (γ₂ * τ)`   (Equation 2)\n\n**4. Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`)**\n\nWe have two expressions for the term `(L/c) / τ`, which is a constant because the detector size `L` and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` do not change.\n\nFrom Equation 1: `(L/c) / τ = 20 * ln(3)`\nFrom Equation 2: `(L/c) / τ = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:\n\n`γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\nSolving for `γ₂`:\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\nNow, we can calculate the numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given Lorentz factor from the first scenario\ngamma1 = 20\n\n# We derived the relationship: gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n# where ln(3/2) is ln(1.5)\ngamma2 = gamma1 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n```output\n54.19039016147426\n```\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

    "This is a problem that involves the concepts of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and radioactive decay.\n\n**1. Set up the foundational equation:**\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive after a certain time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_mean)`\nwhere:\n*   `N` is the number of particles remaining.\n*   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n*   `t` is the time elapsed in the observer's frame (the lab frame).\n*   `τ_mean` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the same observer's frame.\n\n**2. Incorporate Special Relativity:**\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is dilated with respect to its proper lifetime (`τ_proper`), which is its lifetime in its own rest frame. The relationship is `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Time of Flight:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius `L` in the lab frame is `t_lab = L / v ≈ L / c`.\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get the fraction of particles reaching the detector wall:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-(L/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\nLet's define a constant `K = (L/c) / τ_proper`. This constant combines the fixed properties of the experiment (detector size) and the particle (its proper lifetime). The equation simplifies to:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n**3. Analyze the two scenarios:**\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`.\n*   Fraction surviving `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`.\n\nPlugging these values in:\n`1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\nTo solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Lorentz factor `γ₂ = ?`\n*   Fraction surviving `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`.\n\nPlugging these values in with the `K` we just found:\n`2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n`ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\nNow, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n**4. Calculate the final value:**\n\nWe can now compute the numerical value for `γ₂`.\nUsing `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\nFinal check of the logic: To have more particles survive, they need to experience less time during their flight. According to time dilation, a higher Lorentz factor means time passes slower for the particle. Therefore, we expect the required Lorentz factor `γ₂` to be greater than `γ₁`, which it is (54 > 20). The answer is physically reasonable.\n\nAmong the given choices, 54 is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's the thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Concepts:** The problem combines two key concepts:\n    *   **Radioactive (Exponential) Decay:** The number of particles `N` that have not decayed after a time `t` is given by the formula `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_mean)`, where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `τ_mean` is the mean lifetime of the particle.\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** From our perspective in the lab, a fast-moving particle's internal clock runs slow. Its lifetime appears longer to us than its lifetime in its own rest frame (its proper lifetime). The relationship is `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`, where `τ_lab` is the lifetime observed in the lab, `τ_proper` is the particle's intrinsic proper lifetime, and `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n2.  **Set up the Equation for the Lab Frame:** We will analyze the situation from the frame of reference of the detector (the lab frame).\n    *   **Time of Flight (`t`):** The particles are created at the center and travel to the inner wall, a distance equal to the radius `L = 30 m`. They are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which means their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. So, the time it takes them to reach the wall in the lab frame is `t_lab = L / v ≈ L / c`.\n    *   **Mean Lifetime (`τ_mean`):** The mean lifetime we must use in the decay formula is the one observed in the lab frame, which is the time-dilated lifetime: `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n\n    Substituting these into the decay equation gives us the fraction of particles (`N/N₀`) that survive the journey to the wall:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(L/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Scenario:**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Fraction of surviving particles `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`.\n\n    Plugging these values into our equation:\n    `1/3 = exp(-(L/c) / (20 * τ_proper))`\n\n    The term `(L/c) / τ_proper` contains values that are constant for both scenarios (the detector size `L` and the particle's proper lifetime `τ_proper` don't change). Let's solve for this combined constant term. Taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -(L/c) / (20 * τ_proper)`\n    `-ln(3) = -(L/c) / (20 * τ_proper)`\n    `20 * ln(3) = (L/c) / τ_proper`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Scenario:**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₂ = ?` (this is what we need to find).\n    *   Fraction of surviving particles `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`.\n\n    Using the same general equation:\n    `2/3 = exp(-(L/c) / (γ₂ * τ_proper))`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    We can now substitute the expression for the constant term `(L/c) / τ_proper` that we found in Step 3 into the equation from Step 4:\n    `2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)`\n\n    Now, we solve for `γ₂`. Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    `ln(2) - ln(3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    `-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    `ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n    Rearranging the equation to isolate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    To get the final number, we'll compute the value of the expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Derived formula for the new Lorentz factor (gamma2)\n# gamma2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\ngamma_1 = 20\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * math.log(3) / math.log(3/2)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n```output\n54.19039016147426\n```\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately **54.19**.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThis problem involves two main concepts from modern physics:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** Unstable particles decay over time following an exponential law. The fraction of particles remaining `(N/N₀)` after a time `t` is given by `N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_mean)`, where `τ_mean` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the frame where `t` is measured.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** For a particle moving at a relativistic speed, time passes slower compared to a stationary observer. Its mean lifetime as measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is \"dilated\" (lengthened) compared to its lifetime in its own rest frame (`τ_proper`).

Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab = L / v ≈ L / c`.\n*   **Mean Lifetime (`τ_mean`):** The mean lifetime relevant to the decay during the flight is the one observed in the lab frame, which is the dilated lifetime: `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation gives us the fraction of particles that survive the trip to the detector wall:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab) = exp(-(L/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\nLet's simplify by noting that `L`, `c`, and `τ_proper` are all constants in this problem. We can group them into a single constant, `K = (L/c) / τ_proper`. The governing equation becomes:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n**3.

    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Underlying Physics**\n\nThe problem combines two core concepts from physics:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** Unstable particles decay randomly, but for a large population, the fraction of particles `(N/N₀)` that survive after a time `t` follows the exponential decay law: `N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_mean)`. Here, `τ_mean` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the reference frame where time `t` is measured.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** From the perspective of a stationary observer (in the lab), a fast-moving particle's internal clock runs slower. Its mean lifetime appears to be lengthened. This \"dilated\" lifetime (`τ_lab`) is related to its intrinsic lifetime in its own rest frame (`τ_proper`) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n\n**2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\n\nWe need to analyze the situation from the reference frame of the laboratory (the detector).\n\n*   **Time of Flight (t):** The particles are created at the center and must travel the radius `L = 30 m` to reach the detector wall. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is nearly the speed of light `c`.
