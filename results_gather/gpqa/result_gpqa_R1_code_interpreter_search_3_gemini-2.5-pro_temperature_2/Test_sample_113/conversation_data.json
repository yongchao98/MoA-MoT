    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a ketone (butan-2-one) into a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile).\n    *   The mechanism of cyanohydrin formation involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone.\n    *   This attack forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   To obtain the final stable hydroxyl (-OH) group in the product, this alkoxide intermediate must be protonated.\n    *   Therefore, reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺). Among the choices, H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion) is a strong acid and serves as an excellent proton source for this step.\n    *   The overall reaction is the addition of HCN across the carbonyl double bond. Using NaCN requires a source of acid (like H₃O⁺) to generate HCN in situ or to protonate the intermediate.\n    *   NaHSO₃ is incorrect; it forms bisulfite addition products, which is a different reaction.\n    *   Thus, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), while the rest of the molecule, including the hydroxyl group, remains unchanged.\n    *   This transformation is known as the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be carried out under either strongly acidic or strongly basic conditions, typically with heating.\n    *   The question shows the reaction proceeds in the presence of water (H₂O) and reagent B. This indicates either acid-catalyzed or base-catalyzed hydrolysis.\n    *   Looking at the options for B:\n        *   HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is a standard method to convert nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction proceeds by adding water across the carbon-nitrogen triple bond, first forming an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid and an ammonium salt (NH₄Cl in this case).\n        *   CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid under typical conditions.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent B for this hydrolysis is a strong acid, **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the correct reagent for the first reaction is A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   The correct reagent for the second reaction is B = HCl.\n    *   Matching these with the given options, we find that option A provides the correct set of reagents.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "*   **Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n    1.  **Analyze the first reaction:**\n        *   The reaction is: `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`.\n        *   This reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one).\n        *   The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN onto the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃`.\n        *   For the reaction to yield the final hydroxyl (-OH) group, this alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated.\n        *   Reagent 'A' must be a proton source (an acid). The general way to write a strong acid in an aqueous solution is H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion). An acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ would provide this.\n        *   Looking at the options for A, H₃O⁺ is a suitable choice. NaHSO₃ would lead to a different product (a bisulfite addition product), so it is incorrect.\n        *   Therefore, reagent **A must be H₃O⁺**.\n\n    2.  **Analyze the second reaction:**\n        *   The reaction is: `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`.\n        *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis. The rest of the molecule, including the hydroxyl group, is preserved.\n        *   Nitrile hydrolysis is typically carried out under strong acidic or strong basic conditions with heating.\n        *   The options for reagent 'B' are HCl and CH₃COOH.\n        *   HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is commonly used to catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed.\n        *   CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze this reaction to completion.\n        *   Therefore, the most appropriate reagent for this hydrolysis is a strong acid.\n        *   Hence, reagent **B must be HCl**.\n\n    3.  **Conclusion:**\n        *   From the analysis, we have determined that A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n        *   Matching these reagents with the given choices, we find that option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",

The cyanide ion (`CN⁻`) from `NaCN` acts as a nucleophile.\n    2.  The `CN⁻` attacks the partially positive carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    3.  This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, forming a new C-C bond and a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n    4.  To obtain the final stable hydroxyl (-OH) group in the product, this negatively charged oxygen atom in the alkoxide intermediate must be protonated (accept a proton, H⁺).\n*   **Determining Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons.\n    *   `H₃O⁺` (hydronium ion) represents a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄ in water).

The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n*   **Conditions:** Nitrile hydrolysis is a robust reaction that typically requires vigorous conditions, either a strong acid or a strong base, usually with heating. The presence of `(H₂O)` in the equation confirms it is a hydrolysis reaction where water is the reactant, and reagent B is the catalyst.\n*   **Determining Reagent B:** We need a suitable catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n    *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid.
