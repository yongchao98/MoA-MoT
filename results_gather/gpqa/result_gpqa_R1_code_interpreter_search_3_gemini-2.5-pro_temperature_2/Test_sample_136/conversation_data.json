    "An essential principle of particle accelerators like the synchrocyclotron is that charged particles gain energy by being accelerated across an electric field. In a synchrocyclotron, a proton crosses the accelerating gap between the \"dees\" twice during each revolution. The total energy gained is the cumulative sum of the energy boosts from each crossing.\n\nHere is the reasoning to determine the number of revolutions:\n1.  **Energy Gain per Crossing**:\n    The energy gained by a proton (with charge `q=e`) each time it crosses the gap is given by `ΔE = q * U(t)`, where `U(t)` is the instantaneous voltage at the time of crossing. The voltage is given by `U(t) = U₀ cos(2πνt + Φ₀)`. For stable, continuous acceleration (the principle of phase stability), the proton must cross the gap at a consistent phase. This phase is known as the synchronous phase, `Φs`. The problem gives an initial phase `Φ₀ = π/4`, which we can assume to be the synchronous phase `Φs` for which the acceleration is stable.\n    Therefore, the energy gained in a single crossing is:\n    `ΔE = e * U₀ * cos(Φs)`\n\n2.  **Energy Gain per Revolution**:\n    Since the proton crosses the accelerating gap twice in one full revolution, the total energy gained per revolution (`ΔT_rev`) is:\n    `ΔT_rev = 2 * ΔE = 2 * e * U₀ * cos(Φs)`\n\n3.  **Total Number of Revolutions**:\n    The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (`T_initial ≈ 0`) and reaches a final kinetic energy of `T_final = 950 MeV`. The total final kinetic energy is the sum of the energy gained in each revolution multiplied by the total number of revolutions, `N`.\n    `T_final = N * ΔT_rev`\n    `N = T_final / ΔT_rev`\n    `N = T_final / (2 * e * U₀ * cos(Φs))`\n\n4.  **Calculation**:\n    We are given the following data:\n    *   Final kinetic energy, `T_final` = 950 MeV = 950 * 10⁶ eV.\n    *   Peak voltage, `U₀` = 190 kV = 190 * 10³ V.\n    *   Synchronous phase, `Φs` = `Φ₀` = π/4 radians.\n    *   The charge `e` is the elementary charge.\n\n    When we use `T_final` in eV and `U₀` in V, the energy gain `e * U₀` can be directly expressed in eV. So we can write:\n    `N = (950 * 10⁶ eV) / (2 * (190 * 10³ eV) * cos(π/4))`\n    `N = 950 * 10⁶ / (380 * 10³ * cos(π/4))`\n    We know that `cos(π/4) = √2 / 2 ≈ 0.7071`.\n    `N = 950 * 1000 / (380 * (√2 / 2))`\n    `N = 950 * 1000 / (190 * √2)`\n    `N = (950 / 190) * (1000 / √2)`\n    `N = 5 * (1000 / √2) = 5000 / √2`\n    `N = 2500 * √2`\n    `N ≈ 2500 * 1.41421356 ≈ 3535.5`\n\n    To obtain a precise result, let's execute a small python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nTf = 950e6  # Final kinetic energy in eV\nU0 = 190e3  # Peak voltage in V (resulting in U0 eV energy gain for a charge e)\nphi_s = math.pi / 4  # Synchronous phase in radians\n\n# Energy gain per revolution is 2 * (energy gain per pass)\n# Energy gain per pass is U0 * cos(phi_s) in eV\ndelta_T_rev = 2 * U0 * math.cos(phi_s)\n\n# Total number of revolutions N is the total energy divided by energy gain per revolution\nN = Tf / delta_T_rev\n\nprint(f\"{N:.4f}\")\n```\nThe result of this calculation is approximately 3535.5339.\n\nThe number of revolutions must be an integer.
