    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2, denoted as T_eq(4) / T_eq(2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * [ (1 - A) / (4) ]^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / a)\n    Where:\n    *   `T_star` is the temperature of the star.\n    *   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures:** We need to find the ratio T_eq(4) / T_eq(2).\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = { T_star * [ (1 - A_4) / (4) ]^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / a_4) } / { T_star * [ (1 - A_2) / (4) ]^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / a_2) }\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:**\n    *   The planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are constant and cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, so `A_4` = `A_2`. The term `[(1 - A) / 4]^(1/4)` also cancels out.\n    *   This leaves us with:\n        T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = sqrt(1 / a_4) / sqrt(1 / a_2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)\n\n5.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a):\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This implies that the ratio of the squares of the periods is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their semi-major axes:\n    (P_2 / P_4)² = (a_2 / a_4)³\n\n6.  **Solve for the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₄):**\n    To isolate `a₂ / a₄`, we take the cube root of both sides of the equation from step 5:\n    a₂ / a₄ = (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3)\n\n7.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio Equation:** Now, substitute the expression for `a₂ / a₄` back into the simplified temperature ratio from step 4:\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = sqrt( (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3) )\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = [ (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n    By the rules of exponents, we multiply the powers (2/3 * 1/2 = 1/3):\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)\n\n8.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   The period of Planet 2 (P₂) corresponds to the value 2.\n    *   The period of Planet 4 (P₄) corresponds to the value 3.5.\n    *   The ratio P₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5.\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the period ratio into the equation from step 7:\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    We can perform this calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods P2 / P4\nperiod_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\nThe calculation (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) results in approximately 0.8299. Rounding to two decimal places gives 0.83. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
