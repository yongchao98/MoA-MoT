Understand the Normalization Condition**\nIn quantum mechanics, the wave function Ψ(x) describes the state of a particle. The probability of finding the particle in a small interval dx is given by |Ψ(x)|² dx. For the particle to exist somewhere in the allowed space, the total probability must be 1. This is the normalization condition:\n∫ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\nThe integral is taken over the entire region where the particle can be found.\n\n**2.

    "The user wants to determine the value of a constant 'a' in a given wave function. This is a normalization problem in quantum mechanics.\n\n**1. The Principle of Normalization**\nThe fundamental principle for any wave function Ψ is that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the space it's allowed to be must be equal to 1. This is mathematically expressed by the normalization condition:\n∫ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\nwhere the integral is taken over the entire space where the particle can exist.\n\n**2. Defining the Probability Density |Ψ(x)|²**\nThe wave function given is Ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i.\nTo find |Ψ(x)|², we must multiply the wave function by its complex conjugate, Ψ*(x). The complex conjugate is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nΨ*(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i\n\nNow, let's compute the product |Ψ(x)|² = Ψ*(x) * Ψ(x):\n|Ψ(x)|² = [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i ] * [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i ]\nThis multiplication is of the form (A + Bi)(A - Bi), which simplifies to A² + B².\nHere, A = a / sqrt(1 + x) and B = 0.5.\nSo, |Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (0.5)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**3.
