    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\n\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\n\nIf you lack the related knowledge, you can use the Google Search Tool to search the web and get the information.\nYou can call a search query with the format of <search>your search query</search>, e.g., <search>Who is the current president of US?</search>. The searched results will be returned between <information> and </information>.\nOnce the search query is complete, stop the generation. Then, the search platform will return the searched results.\n\nIf you need to search the web, do not generate code in the same response. Vice versa. You can also solve the question without code and searching, just by your textual reasoning.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code or search queries to solve the problem.\n\n    question: A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in the following potential, as a function of (r,θ): V (r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\nFind the energy spectrum.\n\nA) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nC) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
