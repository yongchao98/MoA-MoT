    "*   **1. Identify the Physical System:**\n    The potential energy given is $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. \"Isotropic\" means the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three directions.\n\n*   **2. Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The time-independent Schrödinger equation can be solved for this potential. By separating variables in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$, the problem breaks down into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators. The total energy is the sum of the energies of these three oscillators.\n    The energy of a 1D harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i$ is a non-negative integer quantum number.\n    For a 3D system, the total energy is:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    We can define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$.\n    So the energy eigenvalues are given by the formula:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n*   **3. Identify the Excited States:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest possible energy state, which occurs when $n=0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This is the next energy level, corresponding to $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **4. Calculate the Degeneracy (Number of Independent Eigenfunctions):**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum up to the same value of $n$. We need to find the number of ways to choose three non-negative integers that sum to $n=3$ for the third excited state.\n\n    This is a combinatorial problem (\"stars and bars\").

One number is 3, the others are 0: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) -> 3 states.\n    2.  One number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) -> 6 states.\n    3.
