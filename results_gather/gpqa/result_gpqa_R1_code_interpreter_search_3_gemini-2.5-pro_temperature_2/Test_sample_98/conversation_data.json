    "This question requires identifying a compound from a list of four options based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectral data.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\nThe FTIR spectrum provides key information about the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n1.  **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The peak is broad due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the carboxylic acid molecules.\n2.  **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid (typically found between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n\nAll four options provided are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them. This means the decision must be made based on the more detailed structural information from the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data\nThe 1H NMR data gives crucial information about the connectivity of atoms in the molecule, particularly through the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the signals.\n1.  **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds with attached protons. All candidate structures are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all options.\n2.  **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern indicates that a single proton is being coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to one adjacent proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to two equivalent adjacent protons (n=2).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Coupling to three equivalent adjacent protons (n=3).\n    Therefore, we are looking for a proton (`-CH-`) that is adjacent to a `CH` group, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group.\n3.  **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern indicates a proton is coupled to:\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to one adjacent proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to two equivalent adjacent protons (n=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to another group of two equivalent adjacent protons (n=2).\n    Therefore, we are looking for a proton (`-CH-`) that is adjacent to a `CH` group and two different `CH₂` groups.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Structures of the Candidate Compounds\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the key protons in each candidate molecule. We need to find a molecule that exhibits BOTH a `dtq` and a `dtt` pattern. The order of the splitting (e.g., dtq vs. tqd) doesn't matter, only the set of multiplicities.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   Structure: `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n*   Proton at C3: Is a `-CH-`. It's adjacent to `H` at C2 (1H), the `CH₃` group on C3 (3H), and the `CH₂` group at C4 (2H). This proton's signal would be a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**, which matches the multiplicity of the required `dtq`.\n*   However, there is no proton in this molecule coupled to a `CH` and two `CH₂` groups. Thus, there is **no `dtt`** signal.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   Structure: `(CH₃)₂CH(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   This structure does not have any proton that fits the environment needed for a `dtq` or a `dtt`. For example, H(3) is coupled to H(4) (1H), `CH₂` at C2 (2H), and a `CH₃` (3H), so it would be a `dtt` or `tqd`, but there's an H(4) as well. H(3) is coupled to `CH₂(2)` (2H), `C3-Me` (3H) and `H(4)` (1H). So it's a `tqd` signal. H(4) is coupled to H(3) (1H) and two `CH₃` groups (6H), which would be a doublet of septets (`ds`). This molecule does not match.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   Structure: `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)` where Et = `-CH₂CH₃`\n*   **Proton at C3:** This `-CH-` is adjacent to:\n    *   `H` at C4 (1H) → doublet\n    *   `CH₂` at C2 (2H) → triplet\n    *   `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2H) → triplet\n    *   This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **Proton at C4:** This `-CH-` is adjacent to:\n    *   `H` at C3 (1H) → doublet\n    *   `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2H) → triplet\n    *   `CH₃` group at C5 (3H) → quartet\n    *   This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other required signal.\n*   Since this molecule has protons that produce both of the described splitting patterns, it is a very strong candidate.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   Structure: `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)(Et)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Proton at C3:** This `-CH-` is adjacent to H at C2 (1H), the `CH₂` at C4 (2H), and the `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2H). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   However, let's search for a `dtq`. No single proton is adjacent to a `CH`, a `CH₂` and a `CH₃`. For instance, the diastereotopic protons of the `CH₂(4)` group are each coupled to H(3) (1H), the other proton of the `CH₂(4)` group (1H, geminal coupling), and the `CH₃(5)` group (3H). This would result in a `doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq)`, not a `dtq`.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR splitting patterns, only compound C, **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, has protons that would exhibit both a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\".\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a structure elucidation problem that requires a careful analysis of the provided spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR) to distinguish between four possible isomers.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of FTIR Data\n\nThe FTIR spectrum gives us information about the functional groups present in the molecule.\n1.  **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹**: This is a characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid dimers.\n2.  **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹**: This peak is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The position (1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is typical for the carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR**: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options provided (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group class but does not distinguish between the isomers. We must use the 1H NMR data for that.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of 1H NMR Data\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum provides detailed information about the carbon-hydrogen framework of the molecule, especially through the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the proton signals.\n\n1.  **No vinyl-hydrogens**: This tells us there are no protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H). All four candidate structures are saturated, consistent with this observation.\n\n2.  **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This complex splitting pattern means that a single proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   **Doublet (d)**: Coupling to **one** neighboring proton (based on the n+1 rule, 1+1=2 lines).\n    *   **Triplet (t)**: Coupling to **two** equivalent neighboring protons (2+1=3 lines).\n    *   **Quartet (q)**: Coupling to **three** equivalent neighboring protons (3+1=4 lines).\n    Therefore, we are looking for a methine proton (`-CH-`) that is adjacent to a `CH` group, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group.\n\n3.  **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This pattern indicates another, different proton is coupled to:\n    *   **Doublet (d)**: Coupling to **one** neighboring proton.\n    *   **Triplet (t)**: Coupling to **two** equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   **Another Triplet (t)**: Coupling to another, different set of **two** equivalent neighboring protons.\n    Therefore, we are looking for a methine proton (`-CH-`) that is adjacent to a `CH` group and two different `CH₂` groups.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating Each Candidate Structure\n\nWe must find the single structure that contains protons matching *both* the `dtq` and `dtt` patterns.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   The proton at C3 is adjacent to a `CH` (at C2), a `CH₂` (at C4), and a `CH₃` (on C3). This proton would indeed give a **dtq** signal.\n*   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is adjacent to one `CH` group and two `CH₂` groups. Therefore, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   The proton at C3 is adjacent to a `CH₂` (at C2), a `CH` (at C4), and a `CH₃` (on C3). This would give a **dqt** signal (or `tdq`), matching the multiplicity of the `dtq` signal.\n*   The proton at C4 is adjacent to a `CH` (at C3) and two `CH₃` groups (an isopropyl group). It would be split into a doublet by the C3-H and a septet by the six protons of the two methyl groups, resulting in a **doublet of septets (ds)**. This does not match the required `dtt`. This option is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (let's name it based on its structure: 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nThe structure, written out from the formula, is:\n`CH₃(5) - CH(c)(C₂H₅) - CH(b)(C₂H₅) - CH₂(a) - COOH(1)`\n\n*   **Analyze Proton H(b)** (the proton at position 3):\n    *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂(a)` group (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the `CH(c)` proton (1 proton) -> gives a **doublet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2 protons) -> gives another **triplet**.\n    *   The combined splitting pattern is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n*   **Analyze Proton H(c)** (the proton at position 4):\n    *   It is adjacent to the `CH(b)` proton (1 proton) -> gives a **doublet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the terminal `CH₃(5)` group (3 protons) -> gives a **quartet**.\n    *   The combined splitting pattern is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other observed signal.\n\nSince this molecule contains protons that account for *both* of the unique, complex splitting patterns described, it is the correct structure.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nThe structure is: `CH₃ - CH₂ - CH(c)(C₂H₅) - CH(b)(C₂H₅) - COOH(a)`\n\n*   **Analyze Proton H(c)** (the proton at C3): It is adjacent to `CH(b)` (1 proton), the `CH₂` of the main chain (at C4), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl group. This would give a **dtt** signal.\n*   **Analyze Proton H(b)** (the proton at C2): It is adjacent to `CH(c)` (1 proton) and the `CH₂` of its ethyl group. It is not adjacent to a methyl group. Its signal would be a **doublet of triplets (dt)**, not a `dtq`. This option is incorrect.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nOnly structure C, `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`, correctly predicts the presence of both a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This question requires a step-by-step elucidation of a chemical structure using provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum\n\nThe Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum provides information about the functional groups present in the molecule.\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is a result of intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration.

All four provided options are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the class of compound but does not differentiate between the isomers. To do that, we must analyze the ¹H NMR data.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\nThe proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) spectrum gives detailed information about the hydrogen atoms' environments within the molecule, particularly their connectivity, which is revealed by signal splitting (multiplicity).\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds.

Let's draw its structure and label the key protons:\n`HOOC(1)-CH₂(a)-CH(b)(C₂H₅)-CH(c)(C₂H₅)-CH₃(d)`\n*   **Analyze proton H(b) at C3:** It is adjacent to the `CH₂(a)` group (2H), which will split it into a **triplet**. It is also adjacent to proton H(c) (1H), which will split it into a **doublet**.

According to the n+1 rule:\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to **one** neighboring proton (a CH group).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to **two** equivalent neighboring protons (a CH₂ group).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Coupling to **three** equivalent neighboring protons (a CH₃ group).\n    We are therefore looking for a methine proton (`-CH-`) that is directly bonded to carbons that hold one, two, and three protons, respectively.\n*   **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern means another proton in the molecule is coupled to:\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to **one** neighboring proton (a CH group).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to **two** equivalent neighboring protons (a CH₂ group).\n    *   **Another Triplet (t):** Coupling to another, different set of **two** equivalent neighboring protons (a second, non-equivalent CH₂ group).\n    We are looking for a methine proton (`-CH-`) that is adjacent to another `CH` group and two different `CH₂` groups.\n\nThe correct structure must be the only one that has protons corresponding to **both** of these complex splitting patterns.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure\n\nLet's analyze the key proton environments in each option.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH** (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid): This structure contains a proton that would give a `dtq` signal, but it lacks any proton that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH** (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid): The proton on the carbon bearing the two methyl groups (C4) would be a doublet of septets, which does not match either required pattern.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH** (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):\nLet's draw this structure and label the key protons:\n`HOOC(1)-CH₂(a)-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH₃(d)`\n\n*   **Analysis of Proton H(b) at position 3:** This proton is adjacent to:\n    1.  The `CH₂(a)` group (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n    2.  Proton `H(c)` (1 proton) -> gives a **doublet**.\n    3.  The `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2 protons) -> gives another **triplet**.\n    The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n*   **Analysis of Proton H(c) at position 4:** This proton is adjacent to:\n    1.  Proton `H(b)` (1 proton) -> gives a **doublet**.\n    2.  The `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n    3.  The terminal `CH₃(d)` group (3 protons) -> gives a **quartet**.\n    The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second observed signal.\n\nSince this structure accounts for both required splitting patterns, it is the correct compound.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH** (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid): This structure has a proton that would give a `dtt` signal, but it lacks any proton that could produce a `dtq` signal. The proton at C2 would be a doublet of triplets.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly structure C, `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`, has proton environments that perfectly match both the \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" and the \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" signals described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
