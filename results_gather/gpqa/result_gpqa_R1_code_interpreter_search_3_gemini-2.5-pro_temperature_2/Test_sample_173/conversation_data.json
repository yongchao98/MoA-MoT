    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State**\n*   The initial nucleus is at rest.\n*   Its mass is M.\n*   Its rest-mass energy is `M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\n**2. Understand the Final State (After Fission)**\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Fragment 1 is the \"more massive fragment\". We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can now find their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n**4. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before fission equals the total energy after.\n    *   Initial Energy `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV` (since the nucleus is at rest).\n    *   Final Energy `E_final = E1 + E2`, where `E1` and `E2` are the total energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of the fragments.\n    *   `E_final = (T1 + m1*c^2) + (T2 + m2*c^2)`.\n    *   The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is `T_total = T1 + T2`.\n    *   `M*c^2 = T_total + (m1 + m2)*c^2`\n    *   `T_total = M*c^2 - (m1 + m2)*c^2 = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before fission equals the total momentum after.\n    *   Initial Momentum `p_initial = 0` (since the nucleus is at rest).\n    *   Final Momentum `p_final = p1 + p2`.\n    *   Conservation requires `p1 + p2 = 0`, which means the fragments move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_c = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_c = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nFrom this, we find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T1_c / T2_c = m2 / m1`\nSince `m1 = 2 * m2`, the ratio `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\nSo, `T1_c / T2_c = 1/2`, which means `T2_c = 2 * T1_c`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_c + T2_c = 3 GeV`\n`T1_c + (2 * T1_c) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_c = 3 GeV`\n`T1_c = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**6. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy (T1)**\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nFrom conservation of momentum, `p1^2 = p2^2 = p^2`. So `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n\nRearrange this equation:\n`E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2 - m2*c^2)(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n\nWe know the following values:\n*   `E1 + E2 = E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`\n*   `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nSubstitute these into the equation:\n`(E1 - E2) * (300) = (198 - 99) * (198 + 99)`\n`(E1 - E2) * 300 = (99) * (297)`\n`E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a new system of two linear equations:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdd the two equations to solve for `E1`:\n`2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1 = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1 = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**7.

Let's substitute these values:\n`(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV - 99 GeV) * (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`(E1 - E2) * 300 = (99) * (297)`\n`E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdding the two equations yields:\n`2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe correct kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1_correct = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1_correct = 1005 MeV`\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nDifference = `T1_correct - T1_classical`\nDifference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### **1. Identify Given Information and Conserved Quantities**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus: `E_i = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy, and its initial momentum is `p_i = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Let `m1` be the more massive fragment: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`. This means the sum of their rest-mass energies is `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`.\n\n*   **Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the fission equals the total energy after. `E_i = E_f`.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the fission equals the total momentum after. Since `p_i = 0`, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nFirst, find the rest-mass energy for each fragment.\nWe know `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (300 GeV) = 297 GeV`.\nWe also know `m1 = 2 * m2`, which implies `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first:\n`(2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment, `m1`:\n`m1*c^2 = 2 * (99 GeV) = 198 GeV`\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\n\nThe energy converted from mass into kinetic energy (Q-value) is:\n`Q = T1 + T2 = (M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`. Since the momentum magnitudes `p` are equal for both fragments:\n`T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n`T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### **5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1 Value**\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nSince `p1 = p2`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`(E1)^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (E2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`(E1)^2 - (E2)^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2 - m2*c^2)(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n\nFrom conservation of total energy, `E1 + E2 = E_initial = 300 GeV`. We substitute this and the rest-mass energies:\n`(E1 - E2) * (300) = (198 - 99) * (198 + 99)`\n`(E1 - E2) * 300 = (99) * (297) = 29403`\n`E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a system of two equations to find `E1`:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdding both equations together gives:\n`2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1 = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1 = 1005 MeV`\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = `T1 - T1_classical`\nDifference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<C>>>"
