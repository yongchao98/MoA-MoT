    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the provided 1H NMR data.\nThe problem describes the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n*   The fact that all signals are singlets indicates that the observed protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with. This is common in highly substituted benzene rings where the remaining aromatic protons are isolated, and the alkyl protons are on methyl groups.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR spectra of the individual options.\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each potential compound, paying close attention to symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14 (Correct)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has high symmetry (D2h point group). It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14 (Correct)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry. There is no simple plane that makes protons or methyl groups equivalent in the way Durene is.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyl groups) is in a different chemical environment than the proton at C6 (between a methyl group and a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon). They will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** Based on their positions, there are three distinct sets of methyl groups. Experimental data confirms this, showing **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1).\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H + 1H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H + 3H + 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14 (Correct)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry (C2v point group) that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other, but not to the C1/C4 pair. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H.\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H + 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14 (Correct)\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) produces a quartet for the CH2 protons and a triplet for the CH3 protons due to spin-spin coupling. The problem explicitly states the alkyl signals are **all singlets**. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds. This immediately eliminates option A.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the proposed mixtures based on the combined spectra.\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives:\n*   Two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   Three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's test the remaining options (B, C, and D).\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets). The combined spectrum would have three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio (assuming no signal overlap). This contradicts the data of \"two signals... in a 1:1 ratio\".\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets). This would also result in three aromatic singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio (assuming no signal overlap). This also contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   Durene contributes **one 2H singlet**.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes **one 2H singlet**.\n        *   Since their chemical structures are different, these two singlets will appear at slightly different chemical shifts. The result is **two singlets**, each integrating to 2H. The integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This perfectly matches the provided data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:**\n        *   Durene contributes **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n        *   Assuming the three signals do not overlap, the combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the provided data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum for a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>",

This will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups. The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (both are ortho to the C2 methyl), the C2 methyl is unique, and the C5 methyl is unique.

    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14. All options fit this.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1. This means the two compounds in the mixture each contribute signals of equal total proton count in this region.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** Three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   **Key Clue:** The fact that all signals are *singlets* indicates a high degree of substitution and/or symmetry. Protons are not adjacent to non-equivalent protons. Alkyl groups are likely methyl groups (-CH3) which are singlets unless adjacent to other protons. Ethyl groups would produce triplets and quartets, so `1,4-diethylbenzene` can be eliminated immediately. This rules out option A.\n\n2.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Remaining Compound:**\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent.

This gives **two singlets** (1H each).\n        *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically different methyl groups. This gives **three singlets** (with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H, a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2/C3 are equivalent but different from the first pair.

This contradicts the data.\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Aromatic: One 2H singlet (from durene) + two 1H singlets (from isodurene) = **three** aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. For a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a **1:1** integration ratio (2H:2H). This matches the data.\n        *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. The combination results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.
