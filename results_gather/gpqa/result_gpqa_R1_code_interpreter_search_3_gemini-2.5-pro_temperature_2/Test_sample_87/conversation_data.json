    "*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the experimental setup and observations.**\n    *   **Antigen Delivery:** GFP-tagged rotavirus inner capsid proteins are delivered orally to mice. Rotavirus is a gut pathogen, so this route of administration mimics a natural infection.\n    *   **Antigen Fate:** Some protein is degraded by stomach acid or trapped in mucus, which is expected. However, some successfully reaches the secondary lymphoid organs.\n    *   **Immune Response Location:** The fluorescence is detected in Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are a critical component of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which are secondary lymphoid organs responsible for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens. This is where the immune system is encountering the viral protein.\n    *   **Cellular Activity:** Within the Peyer's patches, a \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. Cell proliferation (clonal expansion) is a hallmark of an adaptive immune response, where lymphocytes that recognize the antigen are stimulated to divide.\n    *   **Genetic Analysis:** The key piece of data is that sequencing the *variable heavy chain gene* from these proliferating cells shows *high variability*. The variable region of an antibody's heavy chain is what determines its specificity for an antigen.\n\n*   **Step 2: Evaluate the possible immunological processes based on the evidence.**\n    *   The process must explain high genetic variability specifically in the *variable* region of the heavy chain gene in *proliferating lymphocytes* within a *secondary lymphoid organ* (Peyer's patch) *after* exposure to an antigen.\n\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is part of the innate immune system. It involves a cascade of proteins that tag pathogens for destruction. It does not involve genetic changes in lymphocytes. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells within specialized structures called germinal centers, which form in secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) after antigen stimulation. SHM introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This generates a diverse pool of B cells, and those with mutations that increase their antibody's affinity for the antigen are selected to survive and proliferate. This process perfectly explains the finding of \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of a \"proliferating cell population\" in the \"Peyer's patches\".\n\n    *   **C) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that *creates the initial diversity* of B cell receptors before the B cells ever encounter an antigen. It occurs in developing B cells within the *primary* lymphoid organ (the bone marrow). While it generates variability, it is not a process that happens in response to antigen in a secondary lymphoid organ. The cells arriving at the Peyer's patch have already undergone VDJ recombination. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers, often alongside SHM. However, CSR changes the *constant region* of the heavy chain gene, which switches the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA). This alters the antibody's effector function but does *not* affect the *variable region* or antigen-binding specificity. The question specifies that variability was found in the *variable* heavy chain gene. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclude the most likely process.**\n    *   Based on the analysis, somatic hypermutation is the only process that fits all the observations: it occurs in secondary lymphoid organs, in proliferating B cells, after antigen encounter, and it specifically creates high variability in the variable region of immunoglobulin genes to improve antigen binding affinity.\n\n<<<B>>>",
