    "This problem requires a two-part calculation for a titration process. First, we need to determine the state of the solution at 25% titration and calculate its pH. Second, we need to determine the state of the solution at the equivalence point and calculate its pH.\n\n**Part 1: Initial Dilution and Equivalence Point Volume**\n\n1.  **Dilution of Acetic Acid:**\n    *   Initial volume of acetic acid (V_acid_initial) = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Initial concentration of acetic acid (C_acid_initial) = 0.05 M\n    *   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Final volume of diluted acid (V_acid_final) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n    *   Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2:\n        *   (0.05 M) * (20.00 cm³) = C_acid_final * (40.00 cm³)\n        *   C_acid_final = (0.05 * 20.00) / 40.00 = 0.025 M\n    *   So, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n2.  **Initial Moles of Acetic Acid:**\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume (in L)\n    *   Moles_acid = 0.025 mol/L * 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n\n3.  **Volume of NaOH to Reach Equivalence Point:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of acid = moles of base.\n    *   Moles_acid = Moles_NaOH = 0.001 mol\n    *   Volume_NaOH = Moles_NaOH / Concentration_NaOH\n    *   Volume_NaOH_eq = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n**Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Conditions at 25% Titration:**\n    *   This is the point where 25% of the initial acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.\n    *   A buffer solution is formed, containing the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   Moles of NaOH added = 0.25 × Moles_acid = 0.25 × 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol\n    *   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ (conjugate base) formed = Moles of NaOH added = 0.00025 mol\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid) remaining = Initial moles -

    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of pH at two different points during the titration of a diluted weak acid with a strong base.\n\n**Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume after adding water (V₂): 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the final concentration (M₂).\n    *   M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate pH at 25% Titration**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻).

    "This problem requires a two-part calculation for the titration of acetic acid with sodium hydroxide. First, we find the pH at 25% titration (in the buffer region), and second, we find the pH at the equivalence point.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**1. Calculate the Concentration of the Diluted Acetic Acid**\nThe initial 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. We use the dilution formula, M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, to find the new concentration (M₂).\n*   Initial Concentration (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂): 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final Concentration (M₂): (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\nSo, the titration involves titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\nAt this point, 25% of the weak acid has been neutralized, forming its conjugate base. The solution is a buffer, and its pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Given Ka = 1.85 × 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n*   **Determine the ratio of [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base (A⁻) to remaining acid (HA) is 25:75, which simplifies to 1:3.\n    *   So, [A⁻]/[HA] = 1/3.\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - log(3)\n    *   pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, **pH ≈ 4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n\n*   **Find moles of acid and total volume:**\n    *   Initial moles of acid = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (acid solution) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n\n*   **Find the concentration of acetate ([A⁻]):**\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**.\n\n*   **Calculate pH from hydrolysis:**\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb = Kw / Ka.\n    *   Kb = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   The hydroxide concentration [OH⁻] is found using [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [A⁻]).\n    *   [OH⁻] = √( (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ) ≈ √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n    *   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated pH values are **4.26** at 25% titration and **8.52** at the equivalence point. These values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
