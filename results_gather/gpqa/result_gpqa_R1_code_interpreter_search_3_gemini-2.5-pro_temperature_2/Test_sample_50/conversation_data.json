    "This problem can be solved using the method of image charges.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** We have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge is outside the sphere, so `d > R`.\n\n2.  **Grounded Sphere Condition:** A \"grounded\" conducting sphere means its electric potential is held at zero (V = 0).\n\n3.  **Method of Image Charges:** To satisfy the boundary condition (V = 0 on the sphere's surface), we can replace the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere will be identical to the original problem.\n\n4.  **Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    *   For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (also from the center) are given by the standard formulas:\n        *   `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n        *   `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   The image charge is located along the same line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Potential Energy (U):** The potential energy of the system is the work done by an external force to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is stored as potential energy.\n\n    There are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n    **Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done against the electric force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`. This force is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'` on the real charge `q`.\n\n    *   Let the charge `q` be at an arbitrary position `x` from the center as it's brought in from infinity.\n    *   The image charge `q'` will be at `b(x) = R^2/x`, and its magnitude will be `q'(x) = -(R/x)q`.\n    *   The distance between the charge `q` at `x` and its image `q'` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force on charge `q` due to the sphere (i.e., due to the image charge) is:\n        `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-Rq/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n        `F(x) = -k * R * q^2 / x * 1 / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2 = -k * R * q^2 / x * x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n        `F(x) = -k * R * q^2 * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n        This is an attractive force (negative sign).\n\n    *   The potential energy `U` is the work done to bring the charge `q` from `∞` to `d`.\n        `U = - ∫_∞^d F(x) dx` (The negative sign is because U is the work done by an external agent, which is `-F`).\n        `U = - ∫_∞^d [-k * R * q^2 * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = k * R * q^2 ∫_∞^d [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n    *   To solve the integral, we use substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, then `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n        `U = k * R * q^2 * ∫ (1/u^2) (du/2)`\n        `U = (1/2) * k * R * q^2 * [-1/u]`\n        `U = (1/2) * k * R * q^2 * [-1 / (x^2 - R^2)]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n        `U = (1/2) * k * R * q^2 * [(-1 / (d^2 - R^2)) - (-1 / (∞^2 - R^2))]`\n        `U = (1/2) * k * R * q^2 * [-1 / (d^2 - R^2) - 0]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    **Method 2: Using the Potential `U = (1/2) qV_induced`**\n    The total energy of a system of charges and conductors is given by `U = (1/2) Σ q_i * V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges.\n\n    *   In our case, the energy of the system is the energy of the charge `q` in the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n    *   The potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced charges on the sphere is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n        `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n        `V_induced = k * (-R/d * q) / (d - b)`\n        `V_induced = k * (-Rq/d) / (d - R^2/d) = k * (-Rq/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `V_induced = -k * R * q / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   The energy formula includes a factor of 1/2 because the source of the potential (the induced charge) is itself created by the presence of `q`.\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * R * q / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Both methods yield the same result.

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The problem describes a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere. The sphere has a radius `R`, and the charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Image Charges:** This problem can be simplified by replacing the conducting sphere with a fictitious \"image charge\". The purpose of the image charge is to create an electric potential that satisfies the boundary condition of the original problem, which is that the potential on the surface of the grounded sphere is zero (V = 0). For the region outside the sphere, the electric field and potential due to the charge `q` and the image charge are identical to the field and potential in the original problem.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Position:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is placed along the line connecting the center and `q`. Its properties are given by standard formulas:\n    *   Magnitude of the image charge: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   Position of the image charge (distance from the center): `b = R^2 / d`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done by an external force to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at `d`. This work is done against the electrostatic force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere. This force is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'` on the real charge `q`.\n\n    A straightforward way to calculate the energy of this interaction is using the formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n    Where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` that is created by all *other* charges, which in this case are the induced charges on the sphere. This potential is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n    Let's calculate `V_induced`:\n    *   The charge creating the potential is the image charge, `q' = - (R/d) * q`.\n    *   The location of the charge `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The location of the image charge `q'` is at distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center.\n    *   The distance between the charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `distance = d - b = d - R^2/d`.\n    *   Let's simplify the distance: `distance = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n\n    Now, we find the potential `V_induced` at `d` due to `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / distance`\n    `V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n\n    The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n    `V_induced = - (k * R * q) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy (U):**\n    Now substitute `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [- (k * R * q) / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *Note on the 1/2 factor:* The factor of 1/2 is crucial. It arises because the induced charge distribution (represented by the image charge) is itself created by the presence of `q`. As `q` is brought in from infinity, the induced charges build up. The work is not simply `qV_final`, but an integral over the process, which results in the factor of 1/2.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression for the potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    Let's examine the given choices:\n    A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect.\n    B) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect (misses the 1/2 factor and has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator).\n    C) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect (has `R^2` instead of `R`).\n    D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - Correct.\n\nThe calculated formula exactly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem requires us to find the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a nearby grounded conducting sphere.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Setup**: We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is fixed at zero (V=0). We are looking for the total potential energy of this arrangement.\n\n2.  **Method of Image Charges**: This is a classic electrostatics problem that is most easily solved using the method of image charges. The principle is to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a simple, fictitious \"image\" point charge inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential is zero on the surface of the sphere (at a distance `R` from the center).\n\n3.  **Find the Image Charge and its Position**:\n    For a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the corresponding image charge `q'` and its position `b` (measured from the center along the same line as `d`) are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Position of the image charge: `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   Magnitude of the image charge: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy**:\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n\n    A direct way to calculate this energy is to consider the energy of the charge `q` in the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere.
