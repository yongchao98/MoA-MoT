    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-).\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their initial amounts.**\n    The solution is prepared by dissolving KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O in water.\n    *   KH2PO4 is a salt that dissociates completely into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate ion).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O is a hydrated salt that dissociates completely into 2 Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate ion), and 2 H2O.\n    *   Therefore, the principal phosphate species initially present are H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.**\n    *   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.2000 L.\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   The concentration of each species is its moles divided by the total volume (0.2000 L).\n\n3.  **Recognize the buffer system.**\n    The solution contains a weak acid (H2PO4-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). This pair constitutes a buffer solution. The pH of this buffer is determined by the equilibrium associated with the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4):\n    H2PO4⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + HPO4²⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸.\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+].**\n    We can use the expression for Ka2 to find the [H+] in the buffer.\n    Ka2 = ([H⁺] * [HPO4²⁻]) / [H2PO4⁻]\n    Rearranging this equation to solve for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n    Since H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ are a weak acid/base pair, their dissociation/hydrolysis is minimal. We can approximate their equilibrium concentrations with their initial concentrations calculated in step 2.\n\n5.  **Determine the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4³⁻].**\n    The orthophosphate ion (PO4³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4²⁻):\n    HPO4²⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + PO4³⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8 x 10⁻¹².\n\n6.  **Calculate the [PO4³⁻].**\n    From the equilibrium expression for Ka3:\n    Ka3 = ([H⁺] * [PO4³⁻]) / [HPO4²⁻]\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4³⁻]:\n    [PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻]) / [H⁺]\n    We will use the [H⁺] calculated in step 4 and the initial concentration of [HPO4²⁻] from step 2 (as its concentration change due to this third dissociation is negligible).\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given constants ---\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000.0  # Volume in Liters\nmass_KH2PO4_g = 1.00  # Mass of KH2PO4 in grams\nmw_KH2PO4_g_mol = 136.09  # Molar mass of KH2PO4 in g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O_g = 1.00  # Mass of Na2HPO4*2H2O in grams\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O_g_mol = 177.99  # Molar mass of Na2HPO4*2H2O in g/mol\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations ---\n# Moles of H2PO4- from KH2PO4\nmoles_H2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4_g / mw_KH2PO4_g_mol\n# Initial concentration of H2PO4-\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_H2PO4 / volume_L\n\n# Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4*2H2O\nmoles_HPO4 = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O_g / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O_g_mol\n# Initial concentration of HPO4^2-\nconc_HPO4 = moles_HPO4 / volume_L\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] ---\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4)\n\n# --- Step 6: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] ---\n# [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\nconc_PO4 = (Ka3 * conc_HPO4) / conc_H_plus\n\nprint(f\"Concentration of H2PO4- (M): {conc_H2PO4}\")\nprint(f\"Concentration of HPO4^2- (M): {conc_HPO4}\")\nprint(f\"Concentration of H+ (M): {conc_H_plus}\")\nprint(f\"Concentration of PO4^3- (M): {conc_PO4}\")\n\n```\nConcentration of H2PO4- (M): 0.0367403924_61_829_596\nConcentration of HPO4^2- (M): 0.028091465812686105\nConcentration of H+ (M): 8.110294117647059e-08\nConcentration of PO4^3- (M): 6.236681023249788e-07\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻) is approximately 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",

Let's break down the process.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the primary species:** The solution is made by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O) in water.\n    *   KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely into K⁺ and the dihydrogen phosphate ion, H₂PO₄⁻.\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissociates completely into 2Na⁺ and the hydrogen phosphate ion, HPO₄²⁻.\n    *   Therefore, the solution contains a mixture of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻), forming a buffer system.\n\n2.  **Calculate initial concentrations:** First, we need to find the molar concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.\n    *   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.2000 L\n    *   Molar mass of KH₂PO₄ = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 177.99 g/mol\n\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = (1.00 g) / (136.09 g/mol)\n    *   Initial [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume (L)\n\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = (1.00 g) / (177.99 g/mol)\n    *   Initial [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume (L)\n\n3.  **Determine the governing equilibrium for pH:** The pH of this buffer solution is governed by the equilibrium between the acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻).
