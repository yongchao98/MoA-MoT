    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\n1.  Z is a hydrocarbon with a general formula of CxHy.\n2.  The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let's use this to find the empirical formula.\n    Mass % of H = (Mass of H / Total Mass) * 100\n    14.28 = (y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H)) * 100\n    Using approximate atomic masses (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1):\n    0.1428 ≈ y / (12x + y)\n    Solving for the ratio y/x:\n    0.1428 * (12x + y) ≈ y\n    1.7136x + 0.1428y ≈ y\n    1.7136x ≈ 0.8572y\n    y/x ≈ 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2\n    This suggests the empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n3.  Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a fully saturated hydrocarbon. The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CnH2n+2, and for a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CnH2n.\n4.  The empirical formula CH2 (which corresponds to a molecular formula of (CH2)n = CnH2n) matches the general formula for a cycloalkane. Let's verify the mass fraction for CnH2n:\n    Mass % H = (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857 or 14.2857%. This is a perfect match.\n5.  Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane. The problem also states that Z is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This is a very strong candidate for Z.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reactions and Mixtures**\n\n1.  **Hydrogenation:**\n    *   Hydrogenation of Mixture X gives only Z (Cyclohexane).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Mixture Y gives only Z (Cyclohexane).\n    *   This implies that all components of both mixtures (the two liquids in X and the two liquids in Y) must have the same carbon skeleton, which is a six-membered ring. They are all C6 compounds based on this skeleton.\n\n2.  **Mixture Y:**\n    *   It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Substance Z (Cyclohexane, C6H12) is one of its components.\n    *   Let the other component be D. Since hydrogenation of D gives Cyclohexane (C6H12), and D does not decolorize bromine water, the most plausible candidate for D is **Benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic (doesn't react with Br2 water under normal conditions) and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = an equimolar mixture of **Cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **Benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   They undergo disproportionation when heated with platinum to form Mixture Y. A disproportionation reaction is a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it involves hydrogen transfer.\n    *   The overall reaction can be written as:\n        A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   Since the reactants (Mixture X) and products (Mixture Y) are both equimolar, it's a 1:1 reaction.\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass (specifically, atoms), we can balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        (Total H in A) + (Total H in B) = (H in Cyclohexane) + (H in Benzene)\n        (Total H in A) + (Total H in B) = 12 + 6 = 18\n\n4.  **Identify Components of Mixture X (A and B):**\n    *   Both A and B are C6 compounds with a six-membered ring skeleton.\n    *   They decolorize bromine water, so they must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds). They are cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n    *   They do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 18.\n    *   Let's consider possible C6 cyclic unsaturated compounds:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One double bond, not conjugated. This is a possible candidate.\n        *   **1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Two double bonds which are conjugated. This is ruled out by the problem statement.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Two double bonds separated by two CH2 groups. They are not conjugated. This is a possible candidate.\n    *   Let's see if we can combine these candidates to have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n        If A is Cyclohexene (C6H10), it has 10 H atoms. To get a total of 18, B must have 18 - 10 = 8 H atoms.\n        If B is 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8), it has 8 H atoms.\n    *   This combination fits perfectly: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **Cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction is a hydrogen transfer from the diene to the ene:\n        C6H8 (1,4-Cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (Cyclohexene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 (Benzene) + C6H12 (Cyclohexane)\n        The diene loses 2 hydrogens to become aromatic benzene, and the ene gains these 2 hydrogens to become the saturated cyclohexane. This is a known and plausible catalytic reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid 1 (A) is Cyclohexene (C6H10), which has **10 hydrogen atoms**.\n*   Liquid 2 (B) is 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8), which has **8 hydrogen atoms**.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = **18**.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon. The problem states its mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%.\n    *   The mass percentage of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon with the general formula CxHy is given by: Mass % H = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1) * 100.\n    *   Let's test common hydrocarbon formulas:\n        *   Alkanes (CnH2n+2): For hexane (C6H14), %H = 14 / (6*12 + 14) = 14/86 = 16.3%.\n        *   Cycloalkanes (CnH2n): For cyclohexane (C6H12), %H = 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.2857%. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   The formula CnH2n for a saturated hydrocarbon corresponds to a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states Z is a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a common cycloalkane solvent.\n    *   Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Mixtures and Reactions:**\n    *   **Hydrogenation:** The fact that both Mixture X and Mixture Y produce only Z (cyclohexane) upon hydrogenation implies that all constituent compounds in both mixtures are based on a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   **Mixture Y:**\n        *   It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n        *   One liquid is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n        *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are either saturated (like cyclohexane) or aromatic.\n        *   The other component of Y must hydrogenate to cyclohexane (Z). The only C6 aromatic compound is benzene (C6H6), which does not react with bromine water under normal conditions and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n        *   Thus, **Mixture Y consists of equimolar amounts of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them A and B) that undergoes disproportionation on a platinum catalyst to form Mixture Y.\n    *   The reaction is: `A + B  ---(Pt, heat)--->  cyclohexane (C6H12) + benzene (C6H6)`\n    *   A disproportionation reaction in this context is a hydrogen-transfer reaction where one molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation. Since both A and B have a C6 skeleton, the carbon atoms are balanced (C6 + C6 -> C6 + C6).\n    *   For hydrogen: The total number of hydrogen atoms in molecules A and B must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n        Total H atoms = H atoms in cyclohexane + H atoms in benzene\n        Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   So, the sum of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules of Mixture X is 18.\n\n4.  **Identify the components of Mixture X:**\n    *   The components of Mixture X decolorize bromine water, so they must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds). They are cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes with a C6 ring.\n    *   A critical piece of information is that there are \"no conjugated multiple bonds\".\n    *   Let's consider possible C6 cyclic unsaturated compounds:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10): Has one double bond, so no conjugation issue.\n        *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8): Has two double bonds separated by a single bond. They are conjugated. This is ruled out.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8): Has two double bonds separated by two single bonds. They are not conjugated. This is a valid candidate.\n    *   We need two molecules from our list of valid candidates (cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene) whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   If we take one molecule of cyclohexene (C6H10) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8):\n        Total H atoms = 10 (from cyclohexene) + 8 (from 1,4-cyclohexadiene) = 18.\n    *   This combination fits all the criteria. The disproportionation reaction would be:\n        `C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene)  --->  C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)`\n        In this reaction, the 1,4-cyclohexadiene acts as a hydrogen donor (gets oxidized to benzene), and the cyclohexene acts as a hydrogen acceptor (gets reduced to cyclohexane).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Mixture X consists of two liquids: cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in these two liquids.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H in C6H10) + (H in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem can be solved by systematically identifying the chemical species in each mixture based on the reactions and properties described.\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, let's denote its formula as CₓHᵧ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%, or 0.1428.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as: `(y * Atomic Mass of H) / (x * Atomic Mass of C + y * Atomic Mass of H) = 0.1428`. Using atomic masses C ≈ 12 and H ≈ 1: `y / (12x + y) ≈ 0.1428`.\n    *   Rearranging the formula gives `y ≈ 0.1428 * (12x + y)`, which simplifies to `y ≈ 1.714x + 0.1428y`, and then `0.8572y ≈ 1.714x`. The ratio `y/x` is approximately 2.\n    *   This suggests an empirical formula of (CH₂)ₙ. The general formula CₙH₂ₙ corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This means Z must be a fully saturated molecule. Therefore, Z cannot be an alkene; it must be a **cycloalkane**.\n    *   Let's check the mass fraction for a cycloalkane (CₙH₂ₙ): Mass % H = `(2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.286%`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Z is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. We can therefore confidently identify Z as cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does *not* decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One of the components is Z, which we identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. Cyclohexane is saturated and fits this description.\n    *   Let the other component be D. The hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the hydrogenation of D must also yield cyclohexane, so D must have a C₆ ring structure.\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water and has a C₆ ring that hydrogenates to cyclohexane, the only possible substance is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not react with bromine water under these conditions.\n    *   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Transformation from Mixture X to Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture X is treated with platinum when heated to form Mixture Y in a disproportionation reaction. A disproportionation reaction is a type of redox reaction where one reactant is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it's a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule loses hydrogen (oxidation) and another gains hydrogen (reduction).\n    *   The reaction is: Mixture X → Mixture Y\n        Let Mixture X consist of two liquids, A and B. The reaction is: `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (A + B) must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n    *   Therefore, the sum of the hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Identity of Components of Mixture X (for consistency check):**\n    *   Mixture X consists of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated (contain double bonds). They are formed from C₆ rings because they are hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n    *   A key constraint is that there are \"no conjugated multiple bonds\".\n    *   Possible C₆ unsaturated cyclic compounds:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀): Has one double bond (not conjugated). This is a valid candidate.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈): Has two non-conjugated double bonds. This is a valid candidate.\n        *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈): Has conjugated double bonds, so it is ruled out.\n    *   We need two of these molecules whose total hydrogen count is 18. The combination of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits perfectly: 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction is indeed `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`, where cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene. This confirms our reasoning.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (A and B) is equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (cyclohexane and benzene), which is 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: Mass % H = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1) * 100.\n    *   We are given Mass % H = 14.28%. We can recognize this value as being very close to 1/7 (1/7 ≈ 14.2857%).\n    *   If the ratio of H atoms to total mass is 1/7, then `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`. This simplifies to `7y = 12x + y`, which leads to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The empirical formula is CH₂ and the general molecular formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This means Z is a fully saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane (an alkane would be CₙH₂ₙ₊₂).\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only one* substance Z, which implies all components share the same carbon skeleton.\n    *   Z is described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ (with n=6) and all other descriptions.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water\". This indicates that its components are either saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   We already know that one of the liquids in Y is substance Z, which is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n    *   The other component must also produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. This means it must also have a C₆ ring structure.\n    *   Since this second component does not react with bromine water and is not cyclohexane, it must be the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene resists addition reactions like with Br₂ water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction from Mixture X to Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y through a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. A disproportionation reaction is a redox reaction in which a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation, it means one molecule donates hydrogen atoms (gets oxidized) while another accepts them (gets reduced).\n    *   The reaction is: Mixture X → Mixture Y. Let the two liquids in Mixture X be A and B.\n    *   So, `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene)`\n    *   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n    *   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms: The total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of Mixture X) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total H in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of Mixture X is 18.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Verification:**\n    *   The problem states that Mixture X decolorizes bromine water (so its components are unsaturated) and has no conjugated double bonds. Let's see if we can find two molecules that fit this and the reaction scheme.\n    *   Our reactants A and B must be C₆ cyclic compounds with double bonds, and their total H count must be 18. Plausible candidates without conjugated bonds are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Checking the hydrogen count: 10 (from cyclohexene) + 8 (from 1,4-cyclohexadiene) = 18. This matches our conclusion from the atom balance.\n    *   In the disproportionation, the 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) loses two hydrogens to become benzene (C₆H₆), and the cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) gains these two hydrogens to become cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). All conditions of the problem are met.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem can be solved by systematically identifying the compounds involved based on the chemical properties and reactions described.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. We can use this to find the empirical formula of Z.\n    *   The value 14.28% is equivalent to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `(y × 1.008) / (x × 12.01 + y × 1.008)`. Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), we get `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7y ≈ 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y ≈ 12x`, or `y ≈ 2x`.\n    *   This means the empirical formula for Z is CH₂, and the molecular formula is of the form CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen\". This indicates that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told that Z is a widely used solvent.

Therefore, Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, and Z (cyclohexane) is one of them.\n    *   Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water\", meaning its components are either saturated (like cyclohexane) or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Mixture Y yields only Z (cyclohexane).
