    "This problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction proceeding via a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the mechanism step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. Bromine is a good leaving group.\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the active species is the amide ion, NH₂⁻), and condensed ammonia serves as both the solvent and a source of protons for the final step.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The conditions (aryl halide with a strong base) are characteristic of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called an aryne (in this case, benzyne).\n\n### Step 2: The Elimination Step - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) is a strong base that will abstract an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n1.  **Position 2**, which has a deuterium (D) atom.\n2.  **Position 6**, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\nThis leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n**Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6**\n1.  The amide ion removes a proton (H⁺) from the C6 position.\n2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 rapidly eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at the C2 position. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n```\n    Br                       (intermediate)\n   / \\D                      / \\D\n  |   |--H  + NH2-  ===>     |   |      ===> Product(s)\n  |   |                      |  (benzyne)\n   \\ / H                      \\ / H\n```\n\n**Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium from C2**\n1.  The amide ion removes a deuteron (D⁺) from the C2 position.\n2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 rapidly eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed in this step, the resulting intermediate is a non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n```\n    Br                         (intermediate)\n   / \\D                        / \\\n  |   |--H  + NH2-  ===>       |  (benzyne)|   ===> Product(s)\n  |   |                        |   |--H\n   \\ / H                       \\ / H\n```\n**Note on Kinetics:** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the kinetic isotope effect, abstraction of the proton (Pathway A) is significantly faster than the abstraction of the deuteron (Pathway B). However, Pathway B is still a possible reaction and will occur to some extent. Since the question asks for the number of *possible* products, we must consider all mechanistically viable routes.\n\nSo, we have two different benzyne intermediates being formed: **3-deuterobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n### Step 3: The Addition Step - Formation of Final Products\nThe nucleophilic amide ion (NH₂⁻) now attacks the reactive benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent to yield the final aniline products.\n\n**Addition to 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\nThe triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The amide ion can attack either end of the triple bond:\n*   **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH₂) attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The product is aniline with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the D at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n*   **Attack at C6:** The amino group (-NH₂) attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The product is aniline with the -NH₂ group at C6 (position 2 relative to the D) and the D at C2 (position 3 relative to the -NH₂ group). This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nSo, Pathway A leads to two distinct products: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n**Addition to Benzyne (from Pathway B):**\nThe intermediate is a standard, non-deuterated benzyne. The amide ion attacks the triple bond. Regardless of which carbon of the triple bond is attacked, the result after protonation is the same due to symmetry.\n*   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The product formed is simply **aniline**, with no deuterium.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we find that three distinct organic products can be formed:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving an elimination-addition reaction mechanism that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom (a good leaving group) at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. The other hydrogen at position 6 is also *ortho* to the bromine.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base. The active species is the amide anion, NH₂⁻.\n    *   **Conditions:** An aryl halide reacting with a very strong base points towards an elimination-addition mechanism via a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: The Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The strong base NH₂⁻ removes a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the bromine leaving group. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions: C2 (with a deuterium) and C6 (with a hydrogen). This leads to two competing elimination pathways.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1. This process forms a reactive benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *Note: Due to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is broken more easily and thus faster than the C-D bond. This is the major pathway.*\n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2, followed by the loss of Br⁻ from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, the resulting intermediate is a standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n        *Note: Although slower than Pathway A, this reaction is still possible. Since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider this minor pathway as well.*\n\n    So, we have formed two different benzyne intermediates: 3-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n3.  **Step 2: The Addition (Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH₂⁻), now attacks the highly strained triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then immediately protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** The NH₂⁻ ion can attack either end of the C1-C6 triple bond.\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH₂) adds to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. Protonation yields a product where the -NH₂ group and the D are adjacent. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** The amino group adds to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation yields a product where the -NH₂ group and the D are separated by one carbon. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from Benzyne (from Pathway B):** The NH₂⁻ ion attacks the standard benzyne intermediate. Regardless of whether it attacks C1 or C2 of the triple bond, subsequent protonation yields the same single product, **aniline** (which contains no deuterium).\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Products**\n    By considering all possible mechanistic steps, we have identified three distinct, possible organic products:\n    1.  Aniline\n    2.  2-deuterioaniline\n    3.  3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>",
