    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is an equilibrium between two isomers, known as tautomers. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** Its structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4, and double bonds between carbons 2-3 and 5-6. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the α-carbons) are C-2, C-3, C-5, and C-6. These carbons are part of a double bond and have no hydrogen atoms attached. Since there are no α-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups. These carbons have α-hydrogens. In fact, these hydrogens are quite acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily tautomerizes to its enol form, which is the aromatic and very stable compound phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism. Therefore, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is HO-CH(CH₃)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the central carbon (C-2). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        Since the central carbon is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers and shows optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is the *trans* isomer of CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. An achiral molecule like dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism. Therefore, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation**\n    *   A = benzoquinone\n    *   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n    *   This combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where a chemical compound exists in two or more interconvertible forms that are in equilibrium. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. This process requires the presence of an α-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen atom can migrate to the carbonyl oxygen, forming a hydroxyl group (-OH), while the single bond between the α-carbon and the carbonyl carbon becomes a double bond (C=C).\n\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. It occurs when a compound is chiral, meaning its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at opposite positions (1 and 4) and C=C double bonds in between (at positions 2-3 and 5-6). To show keto-enol tautomerism, there must be hydrogen atoms on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the α-carbons). In benzoquinone, the α-carbons are C2, C3, C5, and C6. These carbons are part of double bonds and have no attached hydrogen atoms. Since there are no α-hydrogens, **benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are α-carbons to two carbonyl groups each. These carbons are -CH₂- groups and therefore have α-hydrogens. These hydrogens are particularly acidic and readily participate in tautomerization. In fact, the enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic and highly stable compound, so the equilibrium strongly favors this tautomer. Thus, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the -OH group. The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is a planar molecule due to the C=C double bond. It possesses a plane of symmetry that cuts through the C=C double bond. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and cannot be optically active. Furthermore, it has no chiral centers. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This question has two parts. Let's analyze each part separately.\n\n**Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?**\n\nTautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, involves the interconversion of a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). This process requires the presence of at least one hydrogen atom on the α-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups opposite each other and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (α-carbons) are part of the double bonds. As such, these carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. Since there are no α-hydrogens, keto-enol tautomerism cannot occur.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are α-carbons. Each of these α-carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. The presence of these α-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo tautomerism to form its enol, which is phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), an aromatic and very stable compound.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Which compound will show optical isomerism?**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the central carbon (carbon-2), which is attached to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   Group 1: -H (hydrogen)\n    *   Group 2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n    *   Group 3: -CH₃ (methyl)\n    *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and will show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene with an ester group on each carbon of the double bond (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃). The molecule is planar around the double bond and possesses a center of symmetry. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. Dimethyl fumarate has no chiral centers.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the two parts:\n*   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem asks us to identify two specific compounds from given pairs based on their chemical properties: one that does not exhibit tautomerism, and one that does show optical isomerism.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\n**Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers (tautomers). The most common form is **keto-enol tautomerism**, which requires the presence of an **α-hydrogen**—a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. The α-carbon must be sp³-hybridized.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone, C₆H₄O₂):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at opposite positions (1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **α-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   **Analysis:** These α-carbons are part of the C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized, not sp³-hybridized. The hydrogens attached to these carbons (vinylic hydrogens) are not acidic enough to participate in standard keto-enol tautomerism. Furthermore, any tautomerization would disrupt the conjugated system. The transformation to its related dihydroxy compound, hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂), is a reduction reaction, not an isomeric equilibrium. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (C₆H₆O₃):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups.\n    *   **α-Carbons:** The carbons between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups. These are sp³-hybridized α-carbons.\n    *   **Analysis:** The hydrogens on these carbons are α-hydrogens. They are particularly acidic because they are situated between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. This compound readily undergoes tautomerization to form its highly stable aromatic enol form, **phloroglucinol** (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Thus, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.**\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\n**Optical isomerism** occurs in **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃):**\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the -OH group. The four groups attached to it are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four attached groups are different, C2 is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore **will show optical isomerism.**\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a *trans*-alkene. The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond. It possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism.**\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks us to identify two compounds based on their properties. We need to find:\nA.

The compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate that **will** show optical isomerism.\n\nLet's break down each part.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism Analysis\n\n**Tautomerism** is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more interconvertible forms that are in equilibrium. The most common form is **keto-enol tautomerism**, which involves the migration of a proton and a shift of a double bond. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an **α-hydrogen**, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at opposite positions (positions 1 and 4) and double bonds between carbons 2-3 and 5-6. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the α-carbons) are carbons 2, 3, 5, and 6. These carbons are part of the double bonds (they are sp² hybridized) and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.

The carbons located between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups. These are α-carbons, and they possess α-hydrogens. In fact, these hydrogens are quite acidic because the negative charge of the resulting anion can be delocalized over two carbonyl groups. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily shows tautomerism**, equilibrating with its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n\n**Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis\n\n**Optical isomerism** occurs in **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

The molecule is therefore chiral and **will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule's structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the C=C double bond. The molecule is planar around the double bond and possesses a center of symmetry. Any molecule that has a plane or center of symmetry is achiral. Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it **will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining our findings:\n*   **A** = benzoquinone\n*   **B** = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
