    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and its Precursor**\n    *   The product in both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a type of cyclic ester known as a delta-lactone, which is a six-membered ring containing an ester group.\n    *   The IUPAC name indicates a pyran ring (6-membered ring with one oxygen atom, labeled as position 1) with a carbonyl group (`=O`) at position 2 and an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`) at position 4.\n    *   Lactones are formed by the intramolecular cyclization of hydroxycarboxylic acids. To find the precursor, we can conceptually \"break\" the ester bond of the lactone. Breaking the `O(1)-C(2)` bond and adding a water molecule (`H-OH`) gives the open-chain hydroxy acid.\n    *   This process reveals the precursor to be `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n        *   Lactone: `O(1)-C(2)(=O)-C(3)H2-C(4)H(Et)-C(5)H2-C(6)H2`\n        *   Open-chain precursor: `HOOC(1')-CH2(2')-CH(Et)(3')-CH2(4')-CH2(5')-OH`\n    *   The stereocenter in the lactone is at C4. This carbon corresponds to C3 in the `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` chain. The cyclization reaction (intramolecular esterification) does not affect this chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting acid directly determines the stereochemistry of the final lactone. An (R)-acid will produce an (R)-lactone, and an (S)-acid will produce an (S)-lactone.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Starting Materials and Reducing Agents**\n    *   The options provide isomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid` as the starting materials (A and B). This is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free (`-COOH`) and the other is an isobutyl ester (`-COOCH2CH(CH3)2`).\n    *   The structure is: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`. This molecule has a chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n    *   The problem involves two different reducing agents, and their chemoselectivity is the key to solving the problem.\n        *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** A moderately strong reducing agent that selectively reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters. It does *not* typically reduce carboxylic acids. The acid proton is simply removed by the basic hydride.\n        *   **BH₃ (Borane):** A reducing agent that is highly selective for carboxylic acids, reducing them rapidly to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    *   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group (`-COOiBu`) of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`), while leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) untouched.\n    *   **Transformation:** `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`  ---(LiBH₄)---> `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    *   The intermediate formed is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. Upon acidic workup (H⁺), this intermediate cyclizes to form the final lactone product.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The product is the (R)-lactone. As established, this must come from the (R)-hydroxy acid. Since the reduction step does not alter the stereocenter, the starting material A must have had the (R) configuration.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    *   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`), while leaving the ester group (`-COOiBu`) untouched.\n    *   **Transformation:** `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu` ---(BH₃)---> `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`\n    *   The intermediate formed is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`. This hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification upon workup, eliminating isobutanol to form the same lactone product.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The product is the (S)-lactone. This means the intermediate hydroxy-ester must have been (S), and therefore the starting material B must have had the (S) configuration.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion**\n    *   Starting material A is the (R)-isomer.\n    *   Starting material B is the (S)-isomer.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product and its Formation**\n\nThe product in both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. Such lactones are formed by the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of a hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n\nLet's deduce the structure of the open-chain precursor by conceptually \"breaking\" the ester bond of the lactone and adding a water molecule.\n*   The lactone is `(R)-` or `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   Breaking the bond between the ring oxygen (position 1) and the carbonyl carbon (position 2) gives a linear molecule.\n*   The resulting precursor is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n*   The chiral center in the lactone is at C4 (the carbon with the ethyl group). This corresponds to C3 in the open-chain precursor. The cyclization reaction does not affect this chiral center.\n*   Therefore, `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one` must be formed from `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n*   Similarly, `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one` must be formed from `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Starting Materials and Reducing Agents**\n\nThe starting materials are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has two reducible functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOCH2CH(CH3)2`). The key to the problem is the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a moderately strong reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will reduce an ester to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid is usually just deprotonated and not reduced.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This is a unique reducing agent that shows high selectivity for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while esters react much more slowly.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** `LiBH₄` will selectively reduce the ester group of the starting material, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu` --(LiBH₄)--> `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2-OH`\n*   **Intermediate:** The reaction forms `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. This intermediate then cyclizes upon acidic workup (H⁺) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The final product is the `(R)`-lactone. As established in Step 1, this must come from `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. Since the reduction step does not affect the stereocenter, the starting material A must also have the `(R)` configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** `A` is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** `BH₃` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material, leaving the ester group intact.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu` --(BH₃)--> `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`\n*   **Intermediate:** The reaction forms `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`. Upon workup, this hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification, forming the stable six-membered lactone and eliminating isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The final product is the `(S)`-lactone. This means the intermediate hydroxy-ester must have been `(S)`, which in turn means the starting material B must have had the `(S)` configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** `B` is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be the **(R)-isomer**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be the **(S)-isomer**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires understanding the selectivity of two different reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃), and how they act on a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group. We also need to track the stereochemistry throughout the reactions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the product and its precursor**\n\nThe product in both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone).

This compound is a delta-lactone, which is a six-membered cyclic ester. Lactones are formed via the intramolecular cyclization of a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid and a hydroxyl group.\n\n*   To determine the open-chain precursor, we can conceptually break the ester bond within the ring. This involves cleaving the bond between the ring oxygen (position 1) and the carbonyl carbon (position 2) and adding a water molecule.\n*   This \"hydrolysis\" yields `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    *   Precursor Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH`\n*   The chiral center in the lactone is at the carbon atom at position 4 (the one with the ethyl group). This same carbon is the chiral center in the open-chain precursor (at position 3).\n*   The cyclization reaction (intramolecular esterification) does not create or destroy the chiral center, nor does it invert its configuration.\n*   Therefore, to form the `(R)`-lactone, the precursor must be `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n*   Similarly, to form the `(S)`-lactone, the precursor must be `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material and the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe options for starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). The key to solving this problem lies in the specific selectivity of the two reducing agents used.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** This is a moderately strong reducing agent.

    "This problem requires understanding the chemoselectivity of different reducing agents and how stereochemistry is preserved during these reactions.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Product and Identify the Precursor**\n\nThe product of both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, known as a delta-lactone. Lactones are formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a molecule that contains both a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\nTo find the immediate precursor, we can conceptually perform a hydrolysis (add water across the ester bond) of the lactone ring. This breaks the ester linkage and reveals the open-chain hydroxy-carboxylic acid: `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n\n*   **Structure of the precursor:** `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH`\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The lactone product has a stereocenter at the C4 position (the carbon atom with the ethyl group). This stereocenter corresponds to the C3 position of the open-chain precursor. The cyclization reaction does not affect this chiral center. Therefore, `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one` is formed from `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`, and the `(S)`-lactone is formed from the `(S)`-acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material and the Reducing Agents' Selectivity**\n\nThe proposed starting material is an isomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has two functional groups that can be reduced:\n1.  A carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end.\n2.  An isobutyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂`) at the other end.\n\nThe key to solving the problem is the different reactivity of the two reducing agents:\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** A selective reducing agent that reduces aldehydes, ketones, and **esters** to alcohols. It does not readily reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** A highly selective reducing agent that rapidly reduces **carboxylic acids** to alcohols, while reacting much more slowly with esters.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** `LiBH₄` will selectively reduce the **ester group** of the starting material to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched. This directly forms the `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` precursor identified in Step 1.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product is the `(R)`-lactone. As we established, this requires the `(R)`-precursor. Since the reduction reaction does not affect the chiral center, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** `BH₃` will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid group** of the starting material to a primary alcohol. This initially forms an intermediate hydroxy-ester (`isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`). This intermediate then undergoes an intramolecular transesterification to form the final lactone product (eliminating isobutanol).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product is the `(S)`-lactone. Since this reaction also does not affect the original chiral center, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemistry of the products:\n*   Starting Material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
