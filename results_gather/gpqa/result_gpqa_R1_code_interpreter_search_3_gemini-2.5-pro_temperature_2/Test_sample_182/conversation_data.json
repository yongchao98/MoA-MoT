    "Here's a step-by-step process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the structure of the reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to draw its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is attached to the ring. By convention, the carbon atom with the principal functional group (the carboxylic acid) is designated as C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO) is attached to C2 of the ring.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5 of the ring.\n\nBased on this, we can sketch the structure and determine its molecular formula.\n\n*   **Carbon count**:\n    *   Cyclohexene ring: 6 carbons\n    *   Carboxylic acid group (-COOH): 1 carbon\n    *   Formyl group (-CHO): 1 carbon\n    *   Vinyl group (-CH=CH2): 2 carbons\n    *   Total carbons (C) = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10\n\n*   **Hydrogen count**:\n    *   Ring hydrogens: C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H2) -> 7 H\n    *   Functional group hydrogens: -COOH (1 H), -CHO (1 H), -CH=CH2 (3 H) -> 5 H\n    *   Total hydrogens (H) = 7 + 5 = 12\n\n*   **Oxygen count**:\n    *   Carboxylic acid group (-COOH): 2 oxygens\n    *   Formyl group (-CHO): 1 oxygen\n    *   Total oxygens (O) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the reaction and the product**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (Red P + HI). This is a very strong reducing agent. Its function is to reduce almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturations (double/triple bonds) to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon parts.\n\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond (-CH=CH- -> -CH2-CH2-).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a single bond (-CH=CH2 -> -CH2-CH3).\n*   The carbon-carbon ring structure (the cyclohexane backbone) remains intact.\n\nThe final product will be a saturated, monocyclic alkane derivative (an alkyl-substituted cyclohexane). Since the carbon skeleton is preserved, the product will also have 10 carbon atoms.\nThe general molecular formula for a cycloalkane (a saturated hydrocarbon with one ring) is **CnH2n**.\nSince our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula is **C10H20**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or pi (π) bonds in a molecule. The formula for a molecule with the formula CxHy is:\n\n**IHD = (2C + 2 - H) / 2**\n\nFor our product with the molecular formula **C10H20**:\n*   C = 10\n*   H = 20\n\nIHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = (20 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = 2 / 2\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the IHD by inspecting the structure of the product. The product is an alkyl-substituted **cyclohexane**.\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of pi (π) bonds = 0 (the molecule is fully saturated)\n\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\nIHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 5 (This is the IHD of the reactant)\nC) 3\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Structure Determination**:\n    *   The base structure is `cyclohex-3-ene`, which is a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond. A ring counts as one degree of unsaturation, and a double bond counts as another.\n    *   The principal functional group is `-carboxylic acid` (-COOH), which is located at position 1. This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   At position 2, there is a `-formyl` group (-CHO), which is an aldehyde. This group also contains a C=O double bond.\n    *   At position 5, there is a `-vinyl` group (-CH=CH2). This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula Calculation**:\n    *   **Carbons (C)**: 6 from the ring + 1 from -COOH + 1 from -CHO + 2 from the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H)**: A detailed count based on the structure shows 12 hydrogens. The formula is C10H12.\n    *   **Oxygens (O)**: 2 from -COOH + 1 from -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n    *   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n*   **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Reactant (for confirmation)**:\n    *   The IHD formula for CₓHᵧOₙ is IHD = x - y/2 + 1.\n    *   IHD_reactant = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n    *   Alternatively, counting from the structure: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in aldehyde) = 5.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**.\n\n*   **Reagent Function**: This is a powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   **Transformations**:\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    2.  The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    3.  The carbon-carbon double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n    4.  The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a single bond (the vinyl group -CH=CH2 becomes an ethyl group -CH2-CH3).\n\n### **3. Determine the Product**\n\n*   **Structure**: The original carbon skeleton, which is a 10-carbon structure with one ring, remains. However, all double bonds are gone, and all oxygen atoms are removed. The product is a fully saturated alkyl-substituted cyclohexane.\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Since the product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) and the number of carbons is conserved (C=10), its general formula is CnH2n.\n*   Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD indicates the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the molecular formula (C10H20)**\n    *   IHD = C - H/2 + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    *   **IHD = 1**\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the structure**\n    *   The product is an alkyl-substituted **cyclohexane**.\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of π (pi) bonds = 0 (the molecule is fully saturated)\n    *   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1 for the final product.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem requires a two-step approach: first, determining the structure of the product formed in the reaction, and second, calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for that product.\n\n### **Part 1: Determining the Product**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant:** The starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's analyze its structure:\n    *   `cyclohex-3-ene`: A six-membered carbon ring with one C=C double bond.\n    *   `-carboxylic acid` (-COOH): This is the main functional group, attached at position 1. It contains a C=O double bond.\n    *   `2-formyl` (-CHO): An aldehyde group at position 2. It contains a C=O double bond.\n    *   `5-vinyl` (-CH=CH₂): A vinyl group at position 5. It contains a C=C double bond.\n    The carbon skeleton of the reactant contains one ring and a total of 10 carbon atoms.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI** (hydroiodic acid). This is a very strong reducing agent. It is known for performing complete reductions of most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds down to the corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n\n3.  **Predict the Transformations:**\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced, converting the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) into an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   The six-membered ring structure itself remains intact.\n\n4.  **Structure of the Product:** The product is a fully saturated, substituted cyclohexane ring. Since no carbon atoms are lost in the reaction, the product will still have 10 carbon atoms. It will be an alkyl-substituted cyclohexane, which is a monocyclic alkane. The molecular formula for a generic monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) is **CnH2n**. Since our product has 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### **Part 2: Calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also called the degree of unsaturation) tells us the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate it for the product (C₁₀H₂₀):\n\n**Method 1: Using the IHD Formula**\nThe formula for a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ is:\nIHD = (2x + 2 - y) / 2\nPlugging in the values for the product, C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   x = 10\n*   y = 20\nIHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = (20 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = 2 / 2\n**IHD = 1**\n\n**Method 2: Based on the Structure**\nThe product is an alkyl-substituted **cyclohexane**.\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of pi (π) bonds = 0 (the molecule is fully saturated, meaning no double or triple bonds).\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\nIHD = 1 + 0\n**IHD = 1**\n\nBoth methods confirm that the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the final product is 1.\n\nComparing this result to the options provided:\nA) 0\nB) 5 (This is the IHD of the reactant)\nC) 3\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n1.  Determine the chemical structure and molecular formula of the reactant, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n2.  Understand the chemical reaction that occurs when this reactant is treated with red phosphorus and excess HI.\n3.  Determine the structure and molecular formula of the resulting product.\n4.  Calculate the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant Structure**\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene` is a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **Principal Functional Group:** `-carboxylic acid` (-COOH) is at position 1. This group contains one C=O double bond.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   A `formyl` group (-CHO, an aldehyde) is at position 2. This group contains one C=O double bond.\n    *   A `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) is at position 5. This group contains one C=C double bond.\n\nLet's calculate the molecular formula (CₓHᵧO₂):\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 from the ring + 1 from -COOH + 1 from -CHO + 2 from the vinyl group = **10 carbons**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 from -COOH + 1 from -CHO = **3 oxygens**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** A careful count of hydrogens on the structure gives 12.\n*   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (Red P + HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent that performs the following transformations:\n*   It reduces all carbon-oxygen double bonds (ketones, aldehydes).\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon double and triple bonds to single bonds.\n*   In essence, it removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all multiple bonds, converting the molecule to its corresponding alkane, while preserving the carbon skeleton.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product Structure**\n\nApplying the reduction to our reactant:\n*   The six-membered ring remains.\n*   The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring becomes a C-C single bond, resulting in a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a fully saturated, substituted cyclohexane. The carbon skeleton is conserved, so the product still has 10 carbon atoms. Since the product is a monocyclic, saturated hydrocarbon (a cycloalkane), its general formula is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\nFor our product (n=10), the molecular formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD (or degree of unsaturation) can be calculated in two ways:\n\n**Method 1: Using the Molecular Formula**\nFor a molecule CₓHᵧ, the IHD is calculated as:\nIHD = x - (y/2) + 1\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\n**Method 2: Based on the Structure**\nThe IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\nFor the product (a substituted cyclohexane):\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of pi bonds = 0 (the molecule is fully saturated, meaning it has no double or triple bonds).\nIHD = Number of rings + Number of pi bonds\nIHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nBoth methods give an IHD of 1.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem requires us to determine the product of a chemical reaction and then calculate its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This accounts for one ring and one pi (π) bond.\n*   **-carboxylic acid (-COOH):** This is the main functional group, located at position C1. It contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which is another π bond.\n*   **2-formyl (-CHO):** An aldehyde group at position C2. It also contains a C=O double bond (a π bond).\n*   **5-vinyl (-CH=CH₂):** A vinyl group at position C5. It contains a C=C double bond (a π bond).\n\nSo, the reactant has **1 ring** and **4 π bonds**, giving it an IHD of 5.\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This reagent combination is a very powerful reducing agent used for complete reduction. It will:\n1.

All π bonds have been eliminated, and all oxygen atoms have been removed. The only feature contributing to the IHD is the cyclohexane ring itself.\n\nSince the carbon skeleton is preserved, the product still has 10 carbon atoms. As a saturated monocyclic alkane (cycloalkane), its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ.
