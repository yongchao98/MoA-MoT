    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:** We have two inertial frames of reference:\n    *   The \"Galaxy frame\" (let's call it S), which we can consider the stationary frame.\n    *   The \"ejecta frame\" (let's call it S'), which is the moving frame.\n\n2.  **List the Known Quantities:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time interval measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`.

Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   The distance traveled in any frame is calculated as `distance = velocity × time`. In the Galaxy's frame, this formula is `d = v × Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object. This effect is called **time dilation**. The time `Δt` measured in the stationary Galaxy frame is related to the proper time `Δt₀` measured in the moving ejecta frame by the following equation:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   The term `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   First, we substitute the time dilation formula into the distance formula:\n        `d = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n    *   Now, we substitute the expression for the Lorentz factor:\n        `d = v * (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt₀`\n    *   We can compute this value step by step.
