    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the components:** The solution is a mixture of a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2).\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial moles of each reactant:** The number of moles is calculated by multiplying the molarity (M) by the volume in liters (L).\n\n    *   **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid):**\n        *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n        *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n        *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 mol/L * 0.500 L = 0.05 mol\n\n    *   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid):**\n        *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n        *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n        *   HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates: HCl -> H+ + Cl-.\n        *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L * 0.400 L = 0.08 mol\n        *   Moles of H+ from HCl = 0.08 mol\n\n    *   **Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide):**\n        *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n        *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n        *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it completely dissociates: Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2OH-. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of hydroxide ions (OH-).\n        *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L * 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n        *   Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 = 2 * 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n3.  **Perform the neutralization reactions:** When acids and bases are mixed, they react to neutralize each other. The reaction between the strong acid and the strong base occurs first and goes to completion.\n\n    *   **Step 1: Strong Acid vs. Strong Base Reaction**\n        *   Reaction: H+ + OH- -> H2O\n        *   Initial moles of H+ (from HCl) = 0.08 mol\n        *   Initial moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.18 mol\n        *   Since there are more moles of OH- than H+, all the H+ from HCl will be consumed.\n        *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\n    *   **Step 2: Weak Acid vs. Remaining Strong Base Reaction**\n        *   Now, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH). This reaction also goes to completion because a strong base is involved.\n        *   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n        *   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol\n        *   Moles of OH- available = 0.10 mol\n        *   Since there are more moles of OH- than CH3COOH, all the CH3COOH will be consumed.\n        *   Moles of OH- remaining (in excess) = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n        *   Moles of acetate (CH3COO-) formed = 0.05 mol\n\n4.  **Determine the composition of the final solution:** After all reactions, the solution contains:\n    *   Excess OH- = 0.05 mol (from the strong base)\n    *   CH3COO- = 0.05 mol (the conjugate base of the weak acid)\n    *   Spectator ions: Cl-, Ba2+\n\n5.  **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:** The pH of the final solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH-). The contribution of OH- from the hydrolysis of the weak base CH3COO- is negligible in the presence of a much larger concentration of OH- from the strong base.\n\n    *   First, calculate the total volume of the solution:\n        *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n    *   Next, calculate the concentration of OH-:\n        *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n        *   [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L\n\n6.  **Calculate pH:** To get the final pH, we first calculate the pOH from the [OH-] and then use the relationship pH + pOH = 14. A Python script can perform this calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Moles Calculation\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500\nmoles_h_from_hcl = 0.2 * 0.400\nmoles_oh_from_ba_oh2 = 2 * (0.3 * 0.300)\n\n# Step 3: Neutralization Reactions\noh_after_hcl_reaction = moles_oh_from_ba_oh2 - moles_h_from_hcl\noh_final_excess = oh_after_hcl_reaction - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Step 5 & 6: Concentration and pH calculation\ntotal_volume_L = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\nconc_oh = oh_final_excess / total_volume_L\npoh = -math.log10(conc_oh)\nph = 14 - poh\n\nprint(f\"{ph:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n12.62\n\n<<<C>>>",
