    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data and Identify the Products**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of salts A and B is heated, and the resulting gas mixture is passed through three tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture from the changes in the mass of these tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced. This tells us that the original salts did not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing agents, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube is equal to the mass of the element that binds to the copper, which is oxygen.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas (in which case, moles of O₂ = 0.025 mol) or from another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O. If N₂O reacts (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO), the 0.80g mass gain would correspond to 0.05 moles of N₂O. As we will see, both possibilities lead to the same conclusion about the initial salts.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After the three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to the previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   Since the original salts contain N, H, and O (as deduced below), this inert gas is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nFrom the products, we can find the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen comes from the 0.2 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 0.2 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = 0.4 mol H.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and in the substance that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms from H₂O = 0.2 mol H₂O × 1 O/H₂O = 0.2 mol O.\n    *   Moles of O atoms reacted with Cu = 0.05 mol O.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol O.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Nitrogen is the final unreacted gas, N₂. Any N₂ produced from N₂O reacting with Cu would also end up here. The total moles of N atoms in the gaseous products corresponds to the total moles of N atoms in the final 0.1 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 0.1 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂ = 0.2 mol N.\n\nLet's check if the total mass of these elements matches the initial mass.\n*   Mass H = 0.4 mol × 1 g/mol = 0.4 g\n*   Mass N = 0.2 mol × 14 g/mol = 2.8 g\n*   Mass O = 0.25 mol × 16 g/mol = 4.0 g\n*   Total Mass = 0.4 + 2.8 + 4.0 = 7.2 g. This matches the initial mass perfectly.\n\n**3. Identify the Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts contain only Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. They must be salts that decompose into only gaseous products upon heating. This points to ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions. The most common are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. Let's say there were `x` moles of salt A and `x` moles of salt B.\nThe total number of moles of each atom in the mixture can be expressed as:\n*   Total N atoms = x × (N_atoms_in_A + N_atoms_in_B) = 0.2\n*   Total H atoms = x × (H_atoms_in_A + H_atoms_in_B) = 0.4\n*   Total O atoms = x × (O_atoms_in_A + O_atoms_in_B) = 0.25\n\nFrom these equations, we can find the ratio of atoms in the combined \"formula unit\" of (A+B):\nN : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSo, the combined formula of one unit of A and one unit of B is (N₄H₈O₅). We need to partition these atoms into two plausible salt molecules, A and B. A logical way to split this formula is:\n*   Salt A: N₂H₄O₂\n*   Salt B: N₂H₄O₃\n\nLet's check if these formulas correspond to known salts:\n*   N₂H₄O₂ is NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite).\n*   N₂H₄O₃ is NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate).\n\nThis is a very plausible pair of salts.\n\nWe can find the value of `x` (moles of each salt) using any of the elemental equations. For example, using nitrogen:\n*   x × (N_atoms in NH₄NO₂ + N_atoms in NH₄NO₃) = 0.2\n*   x × (2 + 2) = 0.2\n*   4x = 0.2  =>  x = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the original mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃. This is consistent with all the data provided in the problem.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂):** The formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃):** The formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of each tube and the corresponding mass changes to identify the gaseous products.**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced by the decomposition.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = mass / molar mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight of the tube did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This implies the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent and reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, which means the gas reacted with Cu by donating oxygen atoms. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted.\n        *   Molar mass of O is 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms = mass / molar mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   A common gas that would do this under these conditions is dinitrogen monoxide (N₂O), via the reaction N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This implies 0.05 mol of N₂O was present.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all the reactions, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas (at standard temperature and pressure - STP) remained.\n        *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = volume / molar volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   Given the elements we've identified (H, O, and likely N from N₂O), this inert gas must be nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n    We can now sum up all the atoms found in the products to determine the composition of the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.2 mol of H₂O. Moles of H atoms = 0.2 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = 0.4 mol H.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with Cu. Moles of O atoms = (moles from H₂O) + (moles that reacted with Cu) = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol O.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** The final gas is 0.1 mol of N₂. Where did it come from? The reaction in tube №3 (N₂O → N₂ + [O]) shows that the 0.05 mol of N₂O produced 0.05 mol of N₂. This means the other 0.05 mol of N₂ must have been produced directly from the initial decomposition. So, total moles of N atoms = 0.1 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂ = 0.2 mol N.\n\n    *   **Mass check:** Let's verify if the total mass of these elements matches the initial mass of the mixture.\n        *   Mass H = 0.4 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g\n        *   Mass O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g\n        *   Mass N = 0.2 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g\n        *   Total Mass = 0.4 g + 4.0 g + 2.8 g = 7.20 g. This perfectly matches the initial mass.\n\n3.  **Identify salts A and B.**\n    The problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This means we had 'x' moles of salt A and 'x' moles of salt B. The salts are composed of N, H, and O. Common salts that decompose upon heating to form only gaseous products are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n\n    Let's identify the decomposition reactions based on our products:\n    *   We produced N₂ directly, and also H₂O. The reaction for this is the decomposition of ammonium nitrite: **NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O**.\n    *   We produced N₂O and H₂O. The reaction for this is the decomposition of ammonium nitrate: **NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O**.\n\n    So, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n    Let's check if the molar amounts are consistent. We had 0.05 mol of N₂ produced directly and 0.05 mol of N₂O.\n    *   From the stoichiometry, 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ would produce 0.05 mol of N₂. This fits.\n    *   From the stoichiometry, 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ would produce 0.05 mol of N₂O. This also fits.\n    *   This confirms we had an equimolar mixture of 0.05 mol of each salt.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of atoms in the salts.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n\n    *   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n        *   Number of N atoms = 2\n        *   Number of H atoms = 4\n        *   Number of O atoms = 2\n        *   Total atoms in Salt A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\n\n    *   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n        *   Number of N atoms = 2\n        *   Number of H atoms = 4\n        *   Number of O atoms = 3\n        *   Total atoms in Salt B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9\n\n    *   **Total atoms in both salts = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem describes the heating of a salt mixture and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products by passing them through a series of tubes. The mass change in each tube helps us identify the components of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent, which means it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds directly to the mass of water produced by the decomposition.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.2 mol H₂O**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were produced. This is a crucial clue that the original salts **do not contain carbon**.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper (Cu) is a reducing agent. The problem states that CuO was formed, which means a gas in the mixture acted as an oxidizing agent, donating its oxygen to the copper. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen atoms transferred to the copper.\n    *   Molar Mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol O**.\n    *   The gas that donated this oxygen must be an oxide. Since carbon is absent, it must be a nitrogen oxide. A common decomposition product that fits this is dinitrogen monoxide (N₂O). The reaction is: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This indicates that **0.05 mol of N₂O** was present in the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.1 mol**.\n    *   Given that the salts contain nitrogen (from N₂O), this inert gas is most likely **nitrogen (N₂) **.\n\n### **2.

Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts contain only N, H, and O and decompose completely into gases. These properties are characteristic of ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find reactions that produce the gases we've identified (N₂, N₂O, H₂O).\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) decomposition:** NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) decomposition:** NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n\nThese two reactions perfectly match our findings. If we assume the salts are **Ammonium Nitrite** and **Ammonium Nitrate**, let's check the stoichiometry:\n*   We produced 0.05 mol of N₂, which requires 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n*   We produced 0.05 mol of N₂O, which requires 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\nThis scenario fits the \"equimolar mixture\" condition perfectly. Thus, Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃ (or vice-versa).\n\n### **4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of both salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",

The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O is ~18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.2 mol H₂O**.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which turns cloudy in the presence of acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, which means **no acidic gases (and therefore no carbon)** were in the products. The original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing agents. The problem states CuO is formed, so the gas must have donated oxygen. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted.\n        *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) is ~16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol O**.\n        *   The gas that donated this oxygen is likely a nitrogen oxide. The common thermal decomposition product that fits this is dinitrogen monoxide (N₂O). The reaction is: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This implies that **0.05 mol of N₂O** was present.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of an inert gas is left. At Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.1 mol**.\n        *   Given the elements involved (N, H, O), this inert gas is **nitrogen (N₂)**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n    We can now calculate the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g of salts A and B.\n\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the water.\n        *   0.2 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = **0.4 mol H**.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the water and the dinitrogen monoxide.\n        *   (from H₂O) + (from N₂O) = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol O**.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** Nitrogen is in the N₂O that reacted and in the final N₂ gas.\n        *   0.05 mol N₂O contains 0.05 × 2 = 0.1 mol N atoms.\n        *   The final 0.1 mol of N₂ gas contains 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 mol N atoms.\n        *   Wait, this interpretation is incorrect. Let's reconsider. The final 0.1 mol of N₂ includes the N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction.\n        *   Let's tally the gases *before* they reacted: 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O. The remaining gas that doesn't react is N₂. In tube #3, 0.05 mol of N₂O turns into 0.05 mol of N₂. If the total N₂ at the end is 0.1 mol, then the original gas mixture must have contained **0.05 mol of N₂** to begin with (0.05 original + 0.05 from N₂O = 0.1 total).\n        *   Therefore, total N atoms = (from 0.05 mol N₂) + (from 0.05 mol N₂O) = (0.05×2) + (0.05×2) = **0.2 mol N**.\n\n    Let's verify the total mass:\n    ```python\n    mass_H = 0.4 * 1.0  # Moles * Molar Mass of H\n    mass_N = 0.2 * 14.0 # Moles * Molar Mass of N\n    mass_O = 0.25 * 16.0# Moles * Molar Mass of O\n    total_mass = mass_H + mass_N + mass_O\n    print(f\"Calculated total mass is: {total_mass} g\")\n    ```\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B**\n    We need two salts containing only H, N, and O that are known to thermally decompose to produce N₂, N₂O, and H₂O. The most common examples are ammonium salts:\n    *   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** decomposition: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** decomposition: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\n    The problem states the mixture was **equimolar**. Let's assume we started with 'x' moles of each salt.\n    *   `x` moles of NH₄NO₂ produces `x` moles of N₂.\n    *   `x` moles of NH₄NO₃ produces `x` moles of N₂O.\n    *   Our analysis showed that 0.05 mol of N₂ and 0.05 mol of N₂O were produced. This means **x = 0.05 mol**.\n    *   This is perfectly consistent, confirming that salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n    The question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n    *   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n        *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**\n    *   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n        *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**\n\n    The total number of atoms is the sum of the atoms in both salt formulas:\n    Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
