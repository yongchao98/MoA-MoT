    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the molecule using the most abundant isotopes of its constituent atoms.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** The peak at m/z = 158, with a relative abundance of 32%, is the M+2 peak. The ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (~32%) is approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive indicator of the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of isotopes 35Cl (~75%) and 37Cl (~25%)).\n*   **Molecular Formula Calculation:** All the given options are isomers with the formula C7H5ClO2. Let's verify the molecular weight for this formula.\n    *   MW (using ³⁵Cl) = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + 35 + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches the M+ peak.\n    *   MW (using ³⁷Cl) = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + 37 + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158. This matches the M+2 peak.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule contains one chlorine atom and has a molecular formula of C7H5ClO2. All four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl region and corresponds to the C=O stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid carbonyl, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This rules out **B) Phenyl chloroformate** (which is an ester/acid chloride and lacks an O-H group) and **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (which is a phenol and an aldehyde; a phenolic O-H stretch is typically less broad than a carboxylic acid O-H). We are left with options A and C.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is characteristic of the highly deshielded acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The 's' indicates it's a singlet (no adjacent protons), and '1H' confirms it represents one proton. This is consistent with both A and C.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The key information here is the pattern:\n    *   There are a total of 4 aromatic protons (2H + 2H), which fits a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The signals are two **doublets ('d')**, each integrating to **two protons ('2H')**. This specific pattern arises from a high degree of symmetry and is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. In a para-substituted ring, the two protons ortho to one substituent are chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are also equivalent. Each set of protons splits the other, resulting in two doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The aromatic ring is para-substituted.\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is a para-substituted benzene ring. This structure would produce the observed pattern of two doublets for the four aromatic protons.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is an ortho-substituted benzene ring. This structure lacks symmetry and has four chemically distinct aromatic protons, which would result in a much more complex splitting pattern (not two simple doublets of 2H each).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBy combining all the evidence:\n*   MS shows the formula is C7H5ClO2.\n*   IR identifies a carboxylic acid group.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and reveals a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nOnly **4-chlorobenzoic acid** fits all of these spectral characteristics.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a classic spectroscopy problem where we use different analytical techniques to piece together a chemical structure. Let's break down the evidence from each source.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotope for each element.\n*   **M⁺+2 Peak:** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units higher than the molecular ion. Its intensity is 32% of the M⁺ peak (the base peak, 100%).\n*   **Interpretation:** The intensity ratio of the M⁺ peak to the M⁺+2 peak is approximately 100:32, or about 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**. Chlorine has two common isotopes: ³⁵Cl (75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (24.2% abundance), which results in this ~3:1 ratio for M⁺:(M⁺+2).\n*   **Molecular Formula Check:** All the options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. Let's calculate the mass:\n    *   Mass with ³⁵Cl = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + 35 + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 amu. This matches the M⁺ peak.\n    *   Mass with ³⁷Cl = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + 37 + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158 amu. This matches the M⁺+2 peak.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular formula of C₇H₅ClO₂ and contains one chlorine atom. All four options are consistent with this data.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad signal is a classic hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration found in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O stretch. The position (~1720 cm⁻¹) is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids:\n    *   B) Phenyl chloroformate is an acid chloride/ester. **Eliminated.**\n    *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde is an aldehyde and a phenol. **Eliminated.**\n*   We are now left with A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is definitive for the highly deshielded acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. Its integration of 1H confirms this. This is consistent with both remaining options.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** We have two signals in the region typical for protons on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Integration:** The signals integrate to 2H each, for a total of 4 aromatic protons. This matches a disubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The pattern consists of two distinct **doublets**. This symmetrical pattern is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent, and the two protons on the other side are also equivalent. Each set of protons splits the adjacent set into a doublet.\n*   **Conclusion from NMR:** The substitution pattern on the benzene ring is para (1,4).\n    *   A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid has a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. This structure would produce two doublets for the aromatic protons, perfectly matching the data.\n    *   C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid has a 1,2- (ortho) substitution pattern. This structure lacks symmetry, and all four aromatic protons would be chemically different, leading to a much more complex spectrum with four distinct signals and splitting patterns, not two simple doublets.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nCombining all the data, the only structure that fits all the evidence is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n*   **MS:** Correct molecular formula and confirms one Cl atom.\n*   **IR:** Confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, most importantly, establishes the 1,4- (para) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\n<<<A>>>",

Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺) peak at m/z = 156:** This indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most common isotopes of its elements.\n*   **M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with 32% intensity:** The M⁺ peak has 100% relative abundance, so the ratio of M⁺ to M+2 is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This is a very strong and characteristic isotopic signature for the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule. (Natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (using ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular formulas of the options, all of which are C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Molecular Weight = (7 * 12.01) + (5 * 1.01) + 35.45 + (2 * 16.00) ≈ 156.5 g/mol. Using the most abundant isotopes: (7*12)+(5*1)+35+(2*16) = **156**. The data fits.\n    *   All four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is the classic \"hairy beard\" signal characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl of a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate the options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   B) Phenyl chloroformate is an ester/acid chloride. It lacks the carboxylic acid O-H group. **Eliminated.**\n    *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde is an aldehyde and a phenol. It does not have a carboxylic acid group. **Eliminated.**\n*   This leaves us with two possibilities: **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** and **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n### 3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The integration for one proton (1H) confirms this. This is consistent with both remaining options.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Let's analyze the pattern:\n    *   **Symmetry:** There are only two signals for the four aromatic protons (2H + 2H = 4H total). This indicates a high degree of symmetry in the molecule.\n    *   **Splitting:** The pattern of two doublets is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The two protons ortho to the first substituent are chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the second substituent are also equivalent. Each set of equivalent protons is split by the other, resulting in two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The benzene ring is para-substituted.\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** has this 1,4- (para) substitution and would give exactly this symmetrical pattern of two doublets.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** has 1,2- (ortho) substitution. This is an unsymmetrical molecule, and all four aromatic protons would be chemically different, leading to a much more complex spectrum with four distinct signals, not two simple doublets.\n\n### Final Decision\nAll pieces of spectral evidence point to a single structure. The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal identify the compound as a carboxylic acid. The mass spectrum confirms a molecular weight of 156 containing one chlorine atom. The ¹H NMR aromatic pattern is definitively that of a 1,4- (para) disubstituted ring. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at `m/z = 156` represents the molecular weight of the molecule using the most abundant isotopes of its constituent atoms.\n*   **M⁺+2 Peak:** There is a significant peak at `m/z = 158` (2 mass units higher) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak (100%). This `M⁺` to `M⁺+2` ratio of approximately 3:1 is a definitive isotopic signature for the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule. (This is due to the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes: ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular formula containing one chlorine atom, and its weight with ³⁵Cl is 156 amu. All four options are isomers with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which is consistent with this data.\n\n### 2.

The MS confirms the presence of chlorine and the correct molecular weight. The IR confirms a carboxylic acid functional group. Finally, the ¹H NMR unequivocally establishes the 1,4- (para) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<A>>>",
