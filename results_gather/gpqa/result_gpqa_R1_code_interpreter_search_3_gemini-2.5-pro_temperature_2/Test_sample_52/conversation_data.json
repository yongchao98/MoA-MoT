    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Basic Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by two other functional groups. The aromatic part of the molecule will therefore have the formula -C6H4-.\n\n2.  **Identify Functional Groups from FTIR:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an \"ester group.\" An ester group has the general formula R-COO-R'. This group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:** This is the most detailed piece of information.\n    *   **Aromatic-H Signals (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring can have an ortho (1,2-), meta (1,3-), or para (1,4-) substitution pattern. A para-substituted ring with two different substituents will show two signals for the aromatic protons (typically two doublets), as there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. An ortho or meta substitution pattern would typically produce four or three signals, respectively (unless the substituents are identical, which they are not, based on the other signals). Therefore, the \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" strongly suggests a **para (1,4-) substitution pattern**.\n\n    *   **Vinyl-H Signals (2 signals, one doublet (d) and one doublet of quartets (dq)):** Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** attached to a group with no adjacent protons, such as the aromatic ring.\n        *   Let's label the protons: `Aryl-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c)`\n        *   The proton `H(a)` is split only by `H(b)`, resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   The proton `H(b)` is split by `H(a)` (making a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group `CH3(c)` (making a quartet). The combined effect is a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This confirms one of the substituents is a propenyl group, which has the formula -C3H5. This group also accounts for one of the methyl (-CH3) signals.\n\n    *   **-CH3 Signals (2 signals):** We have identified one methyl group as part of the propenyl substituent. The second methyl signal must belong to the other substituent, the ester group.\n\n    *   **No -CH2 Signals:** This is a crucial piece of information. It means there are no methylene (-CH2-) groups in the molecule. Since we have an ester group (R-COO-R') and a second methyl signal, the methyl group must be directly attached to the ester's oxygen, forming a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)**. If it were an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), for example, there would be a -CH2- signal.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:** Based on the analysis, we can assemble the fragments:\n    *   A para-substituted benzene ring: -C6H4-\n    *   A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n    *   A methyl ester group: -COOCH3\n\n    The complete structure is **methyl 4-propenylbenzoate** (or its isomer, 4-propenylphenyl acetate, which has the same formula).\n\n5.  **Determine the Chemical Formula:** Now we sum the atoms from all the fragments to find the molecular formula.\n    *   From the benzene ring (-C6H4-): 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n    *   From the methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 2 Carbons, 3 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens (1+1+3)\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 2 + 3 = 11\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 3 + 5 = 12\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    A) C12H12O2\n    B) C11H14O2\n    C) C12H14O2\n    D) C11H12O2\n\nThe calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure**: The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means the base of the molecule is a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The aromatic ring fragment itself contributes **-C6H4-** to the overall formula.\n\n2.  **Interpret the FTIR Spectrum**: The FTIR spectrum shows an absorption peak for an **ester group**. An ester functional group has the general formula R-COO-R' and contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectrum**: This provides the most detailed information for assembling the molecular structure.\n    *   **Aromatic-H signals (2 signals)**: In a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four aromatic protons is a strong indication of a **para (1,4) substitution pattern**. In this arrangement, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons, leading to two signals (often two doublets).\n    *   **Vinyl-H signals (2 signals)**: These are hydrogens on a carbon-carbon double bond. The splitting patterns are key:\n        *   **One doublet (d)**: This proton is being split by only one neighboring proton.\n        *   **One doublet of quartets (dq)**: This proton is split by two groups of neighbors: one single proton (causing the doublet) and a group of three protons (a -CH3 group, causing the quartet).\n        *   This specific `d` and `dq` pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** attached to the aromatic ring. This fragment contributes **-C3H5** and accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   **–CH3 signals (2 signals)**: We have identified one methyl group as part of the propenyl substituent. The second methyl signal must belong to the other substituent, the ester group.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups**: This is a critical piece of information. Since we have an ester group and a methyl signal associated with it, the simplest structure that avoids a -CH2- group is a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)**. An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) would have a -CH2- signal, which is absent. This ester fragment contributes **-C2H3O2**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula**:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring**: C6H4\n    *   **Propenyl Group**: C3H5\n    *   **Methyl Ester Group**: COOCH3, which contributes C2H3O2\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms from all parts:\n    *   **Carbon (C)**: 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester's methyl) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 (from ester) = **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options**:\n    A) C12H12O2\n    B) C11H14O2\n    C) C12H14O2\n    D) C11H12O2\n\nThe calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D. The structure is most likely methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reasoning process has already been completed. Let's briefly summarize the key deductions that lead to the final answer.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Core**: A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring provides a `C6H4` fragment. The presence of only two aromatic signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern.\n\n2.  **Ester Group**: The FTIR data confirms a `COO` functional group, adding two oxygen atoms to the formula.\n\n3.  **NMR Side Chains**:\n    *   The two vinyl signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) are classic indicators of a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`)**. This group has the formula `C3H5` and contains one of the two methyl groups.\n    *   The absence of any `-CH2-` signals is a critical clue. Since there is an ester and a second methyl group, the ester must be a **methyl ester (`-COOCH3`)**. This avoids creating a `-CH2-` group that would be present in, for example, an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`). The methyl ester fragment has the formula `C2H3O2`.\n\n4.  **Final Formula Calculation**:\n    *   **Carbons**: 6 (from `C6H4` ring) + 3 (from `C3H5` propenyl) + 2 (from `COOCH3` ester) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens**: 4 (from `C6H4` ring) + 5 (from `C3H5` propenyl) + 3 (from `COOCH3` ester) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens**: 2 (from `COOCH3` ester) = **2**\n\nThe molecular formula is therefore **C11H12O2**, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reasoning for this problem has been established and confirmed. Here is a summary of the logical steps leading to the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Core Structure Identification**: The \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" implies a benzene ring with two substituents, providing a base fragment of **C6H4**. The two aromatic proton signals strongly suggest a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern.\n\n2.  **Functional Group Identification**:\n    *   **FTIR**: An \"ester group\" is present, which contributes **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   **¹H NMR**: The signals are interpreted as follows:\n        *   Two vinyl-H signals with \"doublet\" and \"doublet of quartets\" splitting is the classic signature of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This accounts for one of the two -CH3 signals and adds a **C3H5** fragment.\n        *   The absence of any -CH2- signals is a crucial constraint. With the second -CH3 signal belonging to the ester, it must be a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** to avoid having a -CH2- group. This adds a **C2H3O2** fragment.\n\n3.  **Molecular Formula Assembly**: Summing the atoms from the identified fragments:\n    *   **From C6H4 (ring):** 6 C, 4 H\n    *   **From C3H5 (propenyl):** 3 C, 5 H\n    *   **From COOCH3 (methyl ester):** 2 C, 3 H, 2 O\n    *   **Total C**: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   **Total H**: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Total O**: 2\n    *   The complete formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: This calculated formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The analysis of the spectroscopic data leads to the identification of the molecular formula through a step-by-step deduction process.\n\n1.  **Core Structure**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which provides a base fragment of **C6H4**. The fact that there are only two signals for the aromatic protons strongly suggests a 1,4-(para) substitution pattern.\n\n2.  **Functional Groups from Spectra**:\n    *   **FTIR**: Indicates an **ester group (-COO-)**, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **¹H NMR**:\n        *   The two vinyl proton signals, specifically a doublet (d) and a doublet of quartets (dq), are characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment adds **C3H5** to the formula and accounts for one of the methyl (-CH3) signals.\n        *   The presence of two methyl (-CH3) signals means one belongs to the propenyl group, and the other must belong to the ester group.\n        *   The **absence of any methylene (-CH2-) signals** is a crucial clue. It rules out ester types like ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3). The only way to have an ester with a methyl group and no methylene group is to have a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)**.
