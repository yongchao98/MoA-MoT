    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:** The problem describes the decay of a single atom. Radioactive decay is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. The most crucial property of this process is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying in the *next* minute, or the next 150 minutes.\n\n2.  **Define the Mathematical Model:**\n    *   Let `P(t)` be the probability that the atom survives until time `t`.\n    *   The formula for survival probability is `P(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that the atom decays *within* a time `t` is `1 - P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   Using our formula: `P(decay in 100 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`.\n    *   Let's solve for the term `e^(-λ * 100)`:\n        `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32`\n        `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n    *   This equation tells us the probability of surviving for 100 minutes is 68%.\n    *   I can solve for `λ` explicitly by taking the natural logarithm (`ln`):\n        `-λ * 100 = ln(0.68)`\n        `λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n    *   However, I might not need the numerical value of `λ` itself, but rather the value of expressions involving `e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Question Mathematically:**\n    *   The question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    *   Let's denote the decay time as `T`. We want to find the conditional probability `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)`. This can be written as `P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)`.\n    *   The formula for conditional probability `P(A|B)` is `P(A and B) / P(B)`.\n        *   Event A: The atom decays before `t = 200`.\n        *   Event B: The atom survives past `t = 50`.\n        *   \"A and B\" means the atom survives past 50 minutes but decays before 200 minutes. This is `P(50 < T ≤ 200)`.\n    *   So, the required probability is `P(50 < T ≤ 200) / P(T > 50)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probabilities using the Exponential Decay Formula:**\n    *   `P(T > 50)` (probability of surviving past 50 minutes) = `e^(-λ * 50)`.\n    *   `P(50 < T ≤ 200)` (probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes) is the probability of surviving to `t=50` minus the probability of surviving to `t=200`. So, `P(T > 50) - P(T > 200) = e^(-λ * 50) - e^(-λ * 200)`.\n    *   Putting it together in the conditional probability formula:\n        `Probability = (e^(-λ * 50) - e^(-λ * 200)) / e^(-λ * 50)`\n        `Probability = 1 - (e^(-λ * 200) / e^(-λ * 50))`\n        `Probability = 1 - e^(-λ * 200 + λ * 50)`\n        `Probability = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n6.  **Realize the \"Memoryless\" Property Simplification:**\n    *   The result `1 - e^(-λ * 150)` is the fundamental probability of a *new* atom decaying within 150 minutes. This confirms the memoryless nature of the decay. So, the fact that it survived 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability. I just need to calculate the probability of decay over a 150-minute interval.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   My goal is to find `1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   I know from Step 3 that `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n    *   I can write `e^(-λ * 150)` in terms of what I know:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Substitute the known value:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Now, I can calculate the final probability:\n        `Probability = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   I need to compute `(0.68)^1.5`. I'll use a calculator for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We are asked to find the probability of decay in a 150 minute interval.\n# Let this probability be P.\n# P = 1 - e^(-lambda * 150)\n#\n# We know that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 0.32.\n# 1 - e^(-lambda * 100) = 0.32\n# This means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is:\n# e^(-lambda * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n#\n# We need to compute e^(-lambda * 150).

    "This is a problem about the probability of radioactive decay, which is a classic example of a Poisson process. The key feature of such processes is that they are \"memoryless\".
