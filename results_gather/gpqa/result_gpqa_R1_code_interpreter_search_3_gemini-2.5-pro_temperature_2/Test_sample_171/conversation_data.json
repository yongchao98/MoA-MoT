    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in stars, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The relationship between the population of different energy states and temperature in such a system is governed by the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state `i` (`N_i`) to the number of atoms in the ground state `g` (`N_g`) is given by:\n    \n    `N_i / N_g = (g_i / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    \n    Where:\n    *   `g_i` and `g_g` are the statistical weights of the states.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (`1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K`).\n    *   `T` is the absolute temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to both stars:** We have two stars, star_1 and star_2, with effective temperatures `T_1` and `T_2`, respectively. We can write the Boltzmann equation for the same iron energy level in each star.\n    \n    For star_1: `(N_i / N_g)_1 = (g_i / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n    \n    For star_2: `(N_i / N_g)_2 = (g_i / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n    \n    Since we are considering the same transition in the same atomic species (iron), the values of `g_i`, `g_g`, and `ΔE` are the same for both stars.\n\n4.  **Use the information given in the problem:** The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This is interpreted as the ratio of the population of the excited state to the ground state in star_1 is double that in star_2.\n    \n    `(N_i / N_g)_1 = 2 * (N_i / N_g)_2`\n\n5.  **Combine the equations:** Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from the previous step.\n    \n    `(g_i / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_i / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n    \n    The term `(g_i / g_g)` is common on both sides and cancels out:\n    \n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n6.  **Solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2:**\n    *   Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        `ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n    *   Using the properties of logarithms, `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)` and `ln(e^x) = x`:\n        `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n        `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for `ln(2)`:\n        `ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n    *   Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n        `(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)`\n    *   Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n        `(ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n7.  **Substitute the given numerical values:**\n    *   Energy difference, `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    *   Boltzmann constant, `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n    \n    The ratio `ΔE / k` is therefore:\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n    \n    Substitute this value back into the equation:\n    \n    `1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n    \n    This simplifies to:\n    \n    `ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\n8.  **Compare with the given options:** The derived equation `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
