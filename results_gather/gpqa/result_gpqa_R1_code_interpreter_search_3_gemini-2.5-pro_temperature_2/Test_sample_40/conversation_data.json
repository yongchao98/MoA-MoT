    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the frame where the observer is stationary.\n    *   **Glass's Rest Frame (S'):** This is the frame that is moving along with the piece of glass.\n\n2.  **Determine the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the medium (S') relative to the lab (S):** The glass is moving at a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory. We'll denote this as `v`.\n    *   **Velocity of light in the medium's frame (S'):** The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `u' = c/n`. The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is `c=1`. Therefore, the speed of light as measured within the rest frame of the glass is `u' = 1/n`. Since the light beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass is moving, we take this velocity to be positive.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Physical Principle:**\n    The problem asks for the speed of light as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). Since the speeds involved (`v` and `u'`) can be relativistic, we cannot simply add them using Galilean addition (`u = u' + v`). We must use the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding two velocities, `u'` and `v`, that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the final velocity as seen from the stationary frame (the lab).\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (light) in the moving frame (the glass).\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (the glass) relative to the stationary frame.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n5.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We substitute the values from Step 2 into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    The formula becomes:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Now, we simplify the algebraic expression:\n    `u = ( 1/n + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To clear the fractions within the numerator and denominator, find a common denominator for each part:\n    *   Numerator: `1/n + v = 1/n + vn/n = (1 + vn) / n`\n    *   Denominator: `1 + v/n = n/n + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n\n    Now, substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n    `u = ( (1 + vn) / n ) / ( (n + v) / n )`\n\n    The `n` in the denominator of both the main numerator and the main denominator cancels out:\n    `u = (1 + vn) / (n + v)`\n\n    This can also be written as:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The derived speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's check the options:\n    A) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    B) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    C) 1\n    D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
