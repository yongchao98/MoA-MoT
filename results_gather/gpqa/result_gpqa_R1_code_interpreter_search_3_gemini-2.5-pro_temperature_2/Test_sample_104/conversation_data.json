    "This problem requires us to equate the amplitude of photometric variation caused by rotational modulation of a spotted star with the dimming caused by a hypothetical exoplanet transit.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the photometric variation due to starspots\n\nThe brightness of a star is related to its total emitted flux. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the flux ($F$) per unit area from a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature ($T$), i.e., $F = \\sigma T^4$. The total luminosity ($L$) is this flux integrated over the emitting area.\n\nLet's denote the star's effective temperature as $T_{eff}$ and the temperature of the spots as $T_{spot}$.\n*   $T_{eff} = 6000$ K\n*   $T_{spot} = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000$ K\n\nThe star's brightness will be at its maximum when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The luminosity in this case is:\n$L_{max} \\propto A_{disk} \\cdot \\sigma T_{eff}^4$\nwhere $A_{disk}$ is the area of the visible stellar disk ($\\pi R_{star}^2$).\n\nThe star's brightness will be at its minimum when the spotted hemisphere is fully facing the observer. One hemisphere is covered by spots with a filling factor $f=0.20$. So, 20% of this hemisphere's projected area is covered by spots, and the remaining 80% is normal photosphere. The minimum luminosity is a combination of the flux from the hot photosphere and the cooler spots:\n$L_{min} \\propto [(1-f) \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot \\sigma T_{eff}^4] + [f \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot \\sigma T_{spot}^4]$\n\nThe amplitude of the signal, which is the relative drop in flux, is calculated as:\n$\\frac{\\Delta L}{L} = \\frac{L_{max} - L_{min}}{L_{max}}$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for luminosity (and cancelling the common terms $\\sigma$ and $A_{disk}$):\n$\\frac{\\Delta L}{L} = \\frac{T_{eff}^4 - [(1-f)T_{eff}^4 + f \\cdot T_{spot}^4]}{T_{eff}^4}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta L}{L} = \\frac{T_{eff}^4 - T_{eff}^4 + f \\cdot T_{eff}^4 - f \\cdot T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta L}{L} = \\frac{f(T_{eff}^4 - T_{spot}^4)}{T_{eff}^4} = f \\left(1 - \\frac{T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4}\\right)$\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the dimming due to a transiting exoplanet\n\nWhen an exoplanet passes in front of its star, it blocks a portion of the starlight. The fractional dip in brightness, assuming a uniform stellar disk, is the ratio of the projected area of the planet to the projected area of the star:\n$\\frac{\\Delta L}{L} = \\frac{Area_{planet}}{Area_{star}} = \\frac{\\pi R_{pl}^2}{\\pi R_{star}^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2$\n\n### Step 3: Equate the two effects and solve for the planet-to-star radius ratio\n\nTo find the exoplanet size that would produce the same signal amplitude, we set the two expressions for the fractional light drop equal to each other:\n$\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = f \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4\\right)$\n\nNow, we can solve for the relative radius $\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}$ by taking the square root:\n$\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}} = \\sqrt{f \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4\\right)}$\n\nLet's plug in the given values to compute the final answer.\n*   $f = 0.20$\n*   $T_{eff} = 6000$ K\n*   $T_{spot} = 5000$ K\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nf = 0.20\nT_eff = 6000.0\nT_spot = 5000.0\n\n# Calculate the flux drop from spots\nflux_drop_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The flux drop from a planet is (R_pl/R_star)^2\n# So, R_pl/R_star = sqrt(flux_drop_spots)\nradius_ratio = math.sqrt(flux_drop_spots)\n\nprint(radius_ratio)\n```\n> 0.3217923410313463\n\nThe calculation shows that the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet should be approximately 0.32 times the radius of its host star to produce a signal of the same amplitude. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics**\n\nThe problem asks us to find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same drop in brightness as a rotating star with spots. This requires us to model two distinct physical scenarios and equate their effects.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Starspot Brightness Variation**\n    The star's brightness changes as it rotates because one hemisphere is more covered in cool, dark spots than the other. The maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces us, and the minimum brightness occurs when the hemisphere with the most spots faces us. The flux (energy per unit area per unit time) emitted by a surface is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: $F = \\sigma T^4$, where $T$ is the temperature.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: Exoplanet Transit**\n    When a planet passes in front of its star (a transit), it blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a dip in the observed brightness. The amount of dimming is related to the relative sizes of the planet and the star.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Brightness Drop from Starspots**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the rotating, spotted star.\n\n*   Star's effective temperature, $T_{eff} = 6000$ K.\n*   Spot temperature, $T_{spot} = T_{eff} - 1000 K = 5000$ K.\n*   Filling factor of spots on the spotted hemisphere, $f = 20\\% = 0.20$.\n\nThe maximum observed luminosity ($L_{max}$) occurs when the clean hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux from this entire hemisphere corresponds to the star's effective temperature, $T_{eff}$.\n$L_{max} \\propto A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4$\n(where $A_{disk}$ is the projected area of the star's disk).\n\nThe minimum observed luminosity ($L_{min}$) occurs when the spotted hemisphere is fully facing the observer. On this face, 20% of the area emits at the cooler spot temperature ($T_{spot}$), and the remaining 80% emits at the normal temperature ($T_{eff}$).\n$L_{min} \\propto [(1-f) \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4] + [f \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{spot}^4]$\n\nThe amplitude of the signal is the fractional drop in brightness from maximum to minimum:\n$\\frac{\\Delta L}{L} = \\frac{L_{max} - L_{min}}{L_{max}}$\n\nSubstituting our expressions (the common terms like $\\sigma$ and $A_{disk}$ will cancel out):\n$\\frac{\\Delta L}{L} = \\frac{A_{disk} T_{eff}^4 - [(1-f)A_{disk} T_{eff}^4 + f \\cdot A_{disk} T_{spot}^4]}{A_{disk} T_{eff}^4}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta L}{L} = \\frac{T_{eff}^4 - (1-f)T_{eff}^4 - f \\cdot T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta L}{L} = \\frac{f \\cdot T_{eff}^4 - f \\cdot T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4} = f \\left(1 - \\frac{T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4}\\right)$\n\n### **3. Formulate the Brightness Drop from a Planet Transit**\n\nFor an exoplanet transit, the fractional drop in brightness is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n$\\frac{\\Delta L}{L} = \\frac{\\pi R_{pl}^2}{\\pi R_{star}^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2$\n\n### **4. Equate the Effects and Solve**\n\nWe want the planet's dimming to equal the spot-induced variability amplitude. So, we set the two equations equal to each other:\n$\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = f \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4\\right)$\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius $\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}$ by taking the square root:\n$\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}} = \\sqrt{f \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4\\right)}$\n\nFinally, we plug in the numbers to get the solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the squared ratio of radii\n# This term represents the fractional drop in flux\nsquared_radius_ratio = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the planet radius to the star radius\nradius_ratio = math.sqrt(squared_radius_ratio)\n\nprint(radius_ratio)\n```\n> 0.3217923410313463\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.322.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem asks us to find the relative radius of an exoplanet ($R_{pl}/R_{star}$) that would produce the same amplitude of photometric signal as a star with one hemisphere covered in spots.\n\n### **Step-by-step Derivation:**\n\n**1. Calculate the Photometric Signal from Starspots**\n\nThe signal is the difference in brightness between the star when its unspotted hemisphere is visible versus when its spotted hemisphere is visible. The brightness (or flux) of a thermal source is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, $F = \\sigma T^4$, where $F$ is the flux per unit area, $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.\n\n*   Effective Temperature of the star, $T_{eff} = 6000$ K\n*   Temperature of the spots, $T_{spot} = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000$ K\n*   Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere, $f = 20\\% = 0.20$\n\nThe maximum brightness ($L_{max}$) is observed when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The total luminosity is proportional to the area of the stellar disk ($A = \\pi R_{star}^2$) multiplied by the flux from the photosphere.\n$L_{max} \\propto A \\cdot T_{eff}^4$\n\nThe minimum brightness ($L_{min}$) is observed when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. On this side, a fraction `f` of the area is at temperature $T_{spot}$ and the remaining fraction `(1-f)` is at $T_{eff}$.\n$L_{min} \\propto A \\cdot [(1 - f) \\cdot T_{eff}^4 + f \\cdot T_{spot}^4]$\n\nThe amplitude of the signal (the relative drop in flux) is:\n$\\frac{\\Delta L}{L} = \\frac{L_{max} - L_{min}}{L_{max}}$\n\nSubstituting the proportionalities (the constants $A$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out):\n$\\frac{\\Delta L}{L} = \\frac{A T_{eff}^4 - A [(1 - f)T_{eff}^4 + f T_{spot}^4]}{A T_{eff}^4}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta L}{L} = \\frac{T_{eff}^4 - (1 - f)T_{eff}^4 - f T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta L}{L} = \\frac{T_{eff}^4 - T_{eff}^4 + f T_{eff}^4 - f T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta L}{L} = \\frac{f(T_{eff}^4 - T_{spot}^4)}{T_{eff}^4} = f \\left(1 - \\frac{T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4}\\right)$\n\n**2. Calculate the Signal from a Transiting Exoplanet**\n\nWhen a planet of radius $R_{pl}$ transits a star of radius $R_{star}$, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The fractional drop in brightness is equal to the ratio of their projected areas:\n$\\frac{\\Delta L}{L} = \\frac{\\text{Area of Planet}}{\\text{Area of Star}} = \\frac{\\pi R_{pl}^2}{\\pi R_{star}^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2$\n\n**3. Equate the two Signals and Solve**\n\nTo find the planet size that mimics the spot signal, we set the two expressions for the fractional light drop equal to each other:\n$\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = f \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4\\right)$\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius, $\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}$:\n$\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}} = \\sqrt{f \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4\\right)}$\n\nFinally, we plug in the given values to compute the result.\n```python\nimport math\n\nf = 0.20  # filling factor\nT_eff = 6000.0  # star's effective temperature in K\nT_spot = 5000.0 # spot temperature in K\n\n# Calculate the squared ratio (R_pl/R_star)^2, which is the flux dip\nflux_dip = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# Calculate the relative radius R_pl/R_star\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(flux_dip)\n\nprint(relative_radius)\n```\n> 0.3217923410313463\n\nThe calculated relative radius is approximately 0.322.
