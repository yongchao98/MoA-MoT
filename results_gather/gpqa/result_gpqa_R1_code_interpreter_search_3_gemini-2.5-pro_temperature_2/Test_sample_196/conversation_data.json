This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl group analysis (0.9 to 2.9 ppm):**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH₂- group.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH- group.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is a -CH₂- group, likely flanked by the -CH- and the terminal -CH₃ group.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is a -CH- group.

This is a methine (-CH-) group.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons indicates a methyl (-CH₃) group attached to the benzylic methine (-CH-). This gives us a -CH(CH₃)- fragment attached to the ring.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons indicates a methyl (-CH₃) group attached to a methylene (-CH₂-) group. This gives us a terminal ethyl group, -CH₂CH₃.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons is the methylene (-CH₂-) group of the ethyl fragment, which must also be attached to the benzylic methine.\n        *   **Assembling the Structure of Compound X:** The alkyl group attached to the benzene ring is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a **sec-butyl** group.

    "This is a two-step problem. First, we must deduce the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from its spectroscopic data.

The protons at 8.0 ppm are *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing them to be deshielded (shifted downfield). The protons at 7.2 ppm are *ortho* to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Signals:** Let's piece together the structure of the alkyl group attached to the ring.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This signal corresponds to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-) directly attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) is attached to the methine carbon. So far, we have a -CH(CH₃) fragment attached to the ring.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons indicates another methyl group (-CH₃) is attached to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This multiplet for two protons is the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is split by both the adjacent methyl group and the benzylic methine group.\n\n    *   **Assembling the Structure of Compound X:**\n        *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   One substituent is a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   The other substituent is an alkyl group composed of a central methine (-CH-) attached to both a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This is a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n        *   Therefore, the structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
