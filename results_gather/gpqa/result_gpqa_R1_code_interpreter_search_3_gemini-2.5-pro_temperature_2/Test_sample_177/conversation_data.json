The mass dimension of any quantity `Q` is denoted by `[Q]`.\n    `[S] = 0`.\n    The spacetime volume element `d⁴x` has the dimension of (length)⁴. Since mass and energy have dimension 1, and length has dimension -1 in mass units, we have `[d⁴x] = [length]⁴ = [mass]⁻⁴ = -4`.\n    For the action `S` to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension that compensates for `d⁴x`.\n    `[S] = [L] + [d⁴x] = [L] - 4 = 0`\n    Therefore, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density must be `[L] = 4`.

Therefore, the theory described by this interaction is non-renormalizable. This means that as we go to higher energies (short distances), this interaction becomes increasingly strong, and perturbation theory breaks down. Correcting for quantum effects would require introducing an infinite number of new parameters at each order of perturbation theory, making the theory lose its predictive power.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    The mass dimension of `κ` is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.
