    "This problem requires the application of the energy-time Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n1.  **Understand the Principle**: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt), its energy cannot be known with perfect precision.
