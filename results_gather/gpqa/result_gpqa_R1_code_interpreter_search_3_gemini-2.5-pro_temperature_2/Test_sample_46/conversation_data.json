    "**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is a measure of the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   DoU formula: `C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`\n*   For C9H11NO2: `DoU = 9 - 11/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5`\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for a conjugated ester group (Ar-COOR). The conjugation with the aromatic ring slightly lowers the frequency from a typical aliphatic ester (~1740 cm-1).\n\n**3. Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   Integration (3H): A methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   Multiplicity (t, triplet): According to the n+1 rule, this group is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (-CH2-).\n    *   This is the -CH3 part of an ethyl group.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   Integration (2H): A methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   Multiplicity (q, quartet): This group is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (-CH3).\n    *   Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm): This is a highly deshielded chemical shift, characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-).\n    *   Together, the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH2CH3)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   Integration (2H): Two equivalent protons.\n    *   Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet): This is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in -OH or -NH groups. Combined with the IR data, this signal is confidently assigned to the **primary amine (-NH2) protons**.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   Integration: A total of 4 aromatic protons.\n    *   Multiplicity and Pattern: Two doublets of 2H each are the classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   Chemical Shift: The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield, indicating they are adjacent (ortho) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester, -COOEt). The protons at 7.0 ppm are further upfield, indicating they are adjacent (ortho) to an electron-donating group (like the amine, -NH2).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nPutting all the pieces together:\n1.  We have a benzene ring.\n2.  It is 1,4- (para) disubstituted.\n3.  The two substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n4.  The arrangement is such that the protons ortho to the ester are at 8.0 ppm and protons ortho to the amine are at 7.0 ppm.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect substitution pattern (meta) and wrong functional group (amide C=O is ~1680 cm-1).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect ester type. This is an ester of a phenol (-O-CO-R), and the alkyl part is a propionyl group. The NMR for the propionyl group would be different.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which would only show one N-H band in the IR, not two.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all data points: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the ethyl group, para-substituted ring, and amine signals in the NMR.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   The formula for DoU is: `C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`\n*   For C9H11NO2, the DoU is: `9 - 11/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5`.\n*   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. The additional degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) suggests the presence of a double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. Its frequency is characteristic of a conjugated ester (an ester group attached to an aromatic ring or a double bond). The conjugation lowers the frequency slightly from a typical saturated ester (~1735-1750 cm-1).\n\n**3. Analyze the Â¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons (likely a -CH3 group) that are split into a triplet (t). According to the n+1 rule, this means it is adjacent to a -CH2 group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons (likely a -CH2 group) that are split into a quartet (q). This means it is adjacent to a -CH3 group. The chemical shift of 4.5 ppm is significantly downfield, which is typical for a methylene group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2-). Together, the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2-CH3)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. Broad signals for 1 or 2 protons are typical for exchangeable protons like those in -OH or -NH groups. Combined with the IR data, this signal is confidently assigned to the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH2) group**.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (further downfield) and are therefore adjacent (ortho) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester). The protons at 7.0 ppm are more shielded (further upfield) and are adjacent (ortho) to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure:**\n*   From the DoU and NMR, we have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   From the IR and NMR, one substituent is a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n*   From the IR and NMR, the other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**.\n\nCombining these pieces, the only possible structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure matches the molecular formula C9H11NO2 and all the spectral data perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the IR, NMR, and molecular formula, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>",
