    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star wobbles as it orbits the common center of mass with its planet. This wobble causes a shift in the wavelength of its spectral lines.\n\nThe relationship between the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) and the observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is given by the Doppler formula:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\nwhere $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$. Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their measured wavelength shifts.\n\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} $$\n\nGiven values are $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom.\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\n\n### 2. Relating RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude $K$ for a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n$$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_s^{2/3} \\sqrt{1-e^2}} $$\nWhere:\n- $T$ is the orbital period.\n- $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n- $M_s$ is the star's mass.\n- $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n- $e$ is the eccentricity of the orbit.\n- $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 3. Applying the Given Information to Simplify the Formula\n\nThe problem provides several key pieces of information:\n-   **Same stellar mass:** $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n-   **Circular orbits:** $e=0$, so the term $\\sqrt{1-e^2}$ becomes 1.\n-   **Same detected planet mass:** The RV method doesn't measure the planet's true mass ($M_p$) but rather the minimum mass, which is $M_p \\sin i$. The statement \"detected one planet ... both with masses similar to that of Neptune\" implies that this measured quantity is the same for both planets. Therefore, $M_{p1} \\sin i_1 = M_{p2} \\sin i_2$.\n\nWith these simplifications, the formula for K becomes:\n$$ K \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}} $$\nThe RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Periods\n\nWe can now write the ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two systems:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_{p2} \\sin i_2}{M_{s2}^{2/3}}}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_{p1} \\sin i_1}{M_{s1}^{2/3}}} $$\n\nSince $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$ and $M_{p1} \\sin i_1 = M_{p2} \\sin i_2$, most terms cancel out:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(1/T_2)^{1/3}}{(1/T_1)^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\nNow, substitute the value for the ratio $K_2/K_1$:\n$$ 1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\nWe need to solve for the ratio of the periods, $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. To do this, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n$$ 1.4^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\n$$ 2.744 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\n\nFinally, we take the reciprocal to find the desired ratio:\n$$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} $$\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we perform the division.\n```python\nprint(1 / 2.744)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.36443148688046646\n</execute_code>\nThe result is approximately 0.364.

    "This problem requires us to relate the observed wavelength shift in a star's spectrum to the orbital period of an exoplanet orbiting it. Let's break down the physics and the calculation step by step.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity**\n\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the light from their host star. As the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the star wobbles. This wobble causes a periodic shift in the wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of its spectral lines. The magnitude of this shift is proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight.\n\n    The Doppler formula is:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The amplitude of the periodic shift in the star's radial velocity is called the RV semi-amplitude, denoted by $K$. The observed maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$) is directly proportional to $K$.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes for the two stars is equal to the ratio of their measured maximum wavelength shifts:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} $$\n\n    Using the given values:\n    -   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    -   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude (K) Formula**\n\n    For a planet in a circular orbit ($e=0$), the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is given by the formula:\n    $$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_s^{2/3}} $$\n    where:\n    -   $T$ is the orbital period.\n    -   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    -   $M_s$ is the star's mass.\n    -   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit. The term $\\sin i$ accounts for the fact that we only measure the component of the velocity along our line of sight.\n    -   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Applying the Problem's Conditions**\n\n    Let's form the ratio of $K_2$ to $K_1$ and simplify it using the information provided in the problem:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_{p2} \\sin i_2}{M_{s2}^{2/3}}}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_{p1} \\sin i_1}{M_{s1}^{2/3}}} $$\n\n    We can cancel terms based on the given information:\n    -   **\"two stars with exactly the same masses\"**: This means $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$, so the $M_s^{2/3}$ terms cancel out.\n    -   **\"one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune\"**: In the RV method, the quantity that is actually measured is the planet's minimum mass, $M_p \\sin i$. When astronomers report finding a planet of a certain mass via this method, they are referring to this value. The statement implies that this measured quantity is the same for both systems. Thus, we can assume $M_{p1} \\sin i_1 = M_{p2} \\sin i_2$, and these terms cancel out.\n    -   The term $(2\\pi G)^{1/3}$ is a constant and also cancels out.\n\n    After cancellations, the expression simplifies significantly:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(1/T_2)^{1/3}}{(1/T_1)^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n4.  **Solving for the Ratio of Periods**\n\n    We have two expressions for the ratio $\\frac{K_2}{K_1}$:\n    -   From wavelength shifts: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = 1.4$\n    -   From the physics formula: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    Equating these two gives:\n    $$ 1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n    To solve for the period ratio, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ 1.4^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\n    $$ 2.744 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\n\n    The question asks for \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which is the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. To find this, we take the reciprocal of our result:\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} $$\n\n    Now we perform the final calculation.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the final ratio\n# T2/T1 = 1 / 1.4^3\nratio = 1 / (1.4**3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_code>\nThe result is approximately 0.364, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user has not provided a new question. The previous question has been answered with a detailed step-by-step reasoning and a final calculated answer.\n\nBased on the provided information:\n1.

For constant stellar mass and planetary minimum mass ($M_p \\sin i$), the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is related to the orbital period ($T$) by:\n    $$ K \\propto T^{-1/3} $$\n3.

In the context of the RV method, this implies the minimum mass ($M_p \\sin i$) is the same for both planets ($M_{p1}\\sin i_1 = M_{p2}\\sin i_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out when we take the ratio of $K_2$ to $K_1$.\n\n4.  **Simplified Relationship**: The relationship simplifies to $K$ being inversely proportional to the cube root of the period $T$:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: We equate the two expressions for the ratio of $K$ values:\n    $$ 1.4 = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To find the required ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$, we first cube both sides:\n    $$ 1.4^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\n    $$ 2.744 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\n    Then, we take the reciprocal:\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n\nThe value ~0.36 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The analysis of the problem has been completed. The step-by-step reasoning has been laid out, and the calculation has been performed.
