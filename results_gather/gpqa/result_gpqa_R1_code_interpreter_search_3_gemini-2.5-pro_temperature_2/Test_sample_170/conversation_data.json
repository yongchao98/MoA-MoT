    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Question**\n\nThe question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of the increasing yield of the para-bromo-substituted product. This yield is typically understood as the percentage of the para-isomer in the mixture of all monobrominated isomers (ortho, meta, para).\n\nThe six substances are:\n1) Toluene (C6H5-CH3)\n2) Ethyl benzoate (C6H5-COOC2H5)\n3) Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl)\n4) Nitrobenzene (C6H5-NO2)\n5) Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5)\n6) Benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH)\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nWe need to classify each substituent based on its effect on the benzene ring for electrophilic aromatic substitution. Substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they direct the incoming electrophile to specific positions.\n\n*   **Activating Groups (Ortho-, Para-directors):** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive than benzene. They direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-CH3 (Methyl group in Toluene, 1):** Weakly activating.\n    *   **-C2H5 (Ethyl group in Ethylbenzene, 5):** Weakly activating.\n\n*   **Deactivating Groups (Ortho-, Para-directors):** These are halogens. They withdraw electron density via induction (deactivating) but can donate via resonance (o,p-directing).\n    *   **-Cl (Chloro group in Chlorobenzene, 3):** Weakly deactivating, ortho-, para-director.\n\n*   **Deactivating Groups (Meta-directors):** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive than benzene. They direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. The ortho and para positions are strongly deactivated.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitro group in Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **-COOH (Carboxyl group in Benzoic acid, 6):** Moderately deactivating.\n    *   **-COOC2H5 (Ester group in Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Moderately deactivating.\n\n**3. Separate the Groups by Directing Effect**\n\nThe meta-directing groups will produce very little para-isomer, while the ortho-, para-directing groups will produce a significant amount. Therefore, the substances with meta-directors will come first in the order (lowest para yield).\n\n*   **Low para yield group:** Nitrobenzene (4), Benzoic acid (6), Ethyl benzoate (2).\n*   **High para yield group:** Toluene (1), Ethylbenzene (5), Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n**4. Order the Meta-Directors (Substances 4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the amount of para-product formed is very small, but not zero. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group will suppress substitution at the ortho and para positions more effectively.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **C6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5**.\n*   This corresponds to the numerical order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**5. Order the Ortho-, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, we need to compare the factors that determine the ratio of para to ortho product. The main factors are sterics and electronics.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):**\n    *   Both -CH3 and -C2H5 are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference affecting the ortho/para ratio is steric hindrance.\n    *   The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   This increased bulk causes more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making the para position more accessible for the incoming electrophile (bromine).\n    *   Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order of increasing para yield: **C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5**.\n    *   Numerical order: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkylbenzenes (1, 5) with Chlorobenzene (3):**\n    *   The chloro group (-Cl) is a deactivating but ortho-, para-director. Its deactivating nature comes from a strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect.\n    *   This inductive effect is distance-dependent and is felt most strongly at the ortho position, less at meta, and least at para.\n    *   This strong deactivation of the ortho position relative to the para position leads to a high preference for para substitution. This electronic effect often results in a higher para/ortho ratio for halobenzenes compared to simple alkylbenzenes.\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than ethylbenzene.\n    *   Order of increasing para yield: **C6H5-C2H5 < C6H5-Cl**.\n    *   Numerical order: **5 < 3**.\n\n*   **Combining the ortho-, para-directors:** The complete order of increasing para yield for this group is C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5 < C6H5-Cl.\n    *   Numerical order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**6. Combine All Substances into a Final Order**\n\nBy combining the orders from the two groups, we get the final sequence.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho-, para-directors order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n*   The overall combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis order corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understanding the Reaction and Product Distribution**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring dictates two things:\n*   **Reactivity:** Whether the ring reacts faster (activating) or slower (deactivating) than benzene itself.\n*   **Orientation:** Where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will add, primarily at the ortho, meta, or para positions.\n\nThe question asks for the order of increasing **weight fraction of the para-isomer**. This means we need to determine the percentage of the para-product relative to all other isomers formed.\n\n**2. Classifying the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent based on its directing effect.\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They generally have lone pairs of electrons to donate by resonance (like -Cl) or are alkyl groups (like -CH3, -C2H5) that donate by induction and hyperconjugation. These compounds will produce a significant amount of para-product.\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an activating ortho-, para-director.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an activating ortho-, para-director.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a deactivating ortho-, para-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, especially from the ortho and para positions, making the meta position the least deactivated and thus the primary site of attack. These compounds will produce very little para-product.\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a strongly deactivating meta-director.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a moderately deactivating meta-director.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is a moderately deactivating meta-director.\n\n**3. Establishing a General Order**\n\nSince meta-directors produce very low yields of para-isomers and ortho-, para-directors produce high yields, we can immediately separate the compounds into two groups. The order will be (meta-directors) < (ortho-, para-directors).\n\n*   Low para-yield group: {4, 6, 2}\n*   High para-yield group: {1, 3, 5}\n\n**4. Ranking the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the tiny amount of para-product formed is inversely proportional to how strongly the group deactivates the ring. A stronger deactivating group suppresses substitution at the para position more effectively.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**. The nitro group is one of the most powerful deactivators. The carboxyl group is slightly more deactivating than the ester group.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **C6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5**.\n*   This gives the partial order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**5. Ranking the Ortho-, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor this group, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho products. The two main factors are steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):**\n    *   The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions more than in toluene.\n    *   As a result, a higher proportion of the reaction occurs at the less-hindered para position for ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the para-isomer yield is higher for ethylbenzene than for toluene: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing the Alkylbenzenes (1, 5) with Chlorobenzene (3):**\n    *   The chlorine atom in chlorobenzene has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect). This effect is distance-dependent and strongly deactivates the nearest positions, i.e., the ortho positions.\n    *   While the alkyl groups are activating, the -Cl is deactivating, but its deactivation is much more pronounced at the ortho position than the para position.\n    *   This strong electronic bias leads to a very high preference for para substitution in chlorobenzene, typically resulting in a higher para percentage than even the sterically hindered alkylbenzenes. For bromination, chlorobenzene gives about 87-89% para-isomer, while ethylbenzene is slightly lower.\n    *   Therefore, the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is the highest in this group: **5 < 3**.\n\n*   Combining these gives the partial order for the high-yield group: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**6. Final Combined Order**\n\nBy combining the two ranked groups, we get the complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer.\n\n(Meta-directors) < (Ortho-, para-directors)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe final order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of *increasing* weight fraction of the *para-isomer* yield. This means we need to determine the percentage of para-product formed during an electrophilic bromination reaction for each substance and then rank them from lowest to highest.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction:**\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), specifically bromination. The substituent already present on the benzene ring (C₆H₅-) controls two key aspects:\n*   **Reactivity:** Whether the ring is more or less reactive than benzene.\n*   **Orientation:** Where the incoming electrophile (Br⁺) will preferentially add (ortho, meta, or para position).\n\n**3. Classify the Substituents:**\nWe must first classify each substituent based on its directing effect. This is the most crucial step.\n\n*   **Group A: Meta-Directors**\n    These groups withdraw electron density from the ring and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They strongly deactivate the ortho and para positions. Consequently, they will produce a very low percentage of the para-isomer.\n    *   **-NO₂ (in Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **-COOH (in Benzoic acid, 6):** Moderately deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **-COOC₂H₅ (in Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Moderately deactivating, meta-director.\n\n*   **Group B: Ortho-, Para-Directors**\n    These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant percentage of the para-isomer.\n    *   **-CH₃ (in Toluene, 1):** Activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   **-C₂H₅ (in Ethylbenzene, 5):** Activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   **-Cl (in Chlorobenzene, 3):** Deactivating, but ortho-, para-director (due to lone pair resonance).\n\n**4. Establish the Broad Order:**\nBased on the classification, all substances in Group A (meta-directors) will have a lower para-yield than all substances in Group B (ortho-, para-directors).\nSo, the final order will look like: **{Group A} < {Group B}**.\n\n**5. Order the Substances within Group A (Meta-Directors: 4, 6, 2):**\nFor these compounds, the yield of the para-product is extremely low. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the substituent's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivator suppresses substitution at the o- and p- positions more effectively.\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield (lowest to highest) is the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n*   Order: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n*   So, the first part of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**6. Order the Substances within Group B (Ortho-, Para-Directors: 1, 5, 3):**\nFor this group, we need to compare the para/ortho ratio. A higher para/ortho ratio means a higher percentage of para-isomer. This is determined by steric and electronic factors.\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** Both -CH₃ and -C₂H₅ are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference is their size (steric hindrance). The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the remote para position a more likely site for the attack by the electrophile. Thus, ethylbenzene yields a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkylbenzenes (1, 5) with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chloro group (-Cl) has a powerful electron-withdrawing inductive effect. This effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions much more than the distant para position. This strong electronic preference for the para position in halobenzenes often results in a very high para/ortho ratio, even higher than for sterically hindered alkylbenzenes.\n    *   Typical para-isomer yields in bromination are: Toluene (~67%), Chlorobenzene (~89%). Ethylbenzene's para-yield is higher than toluene's but generally lower than chlorobenzene's.\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene (3) will have the highest para-isomer yield in this group.\n    *   Order: **Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n*   Combining these observations for Group B gives the sequence: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n*   The second part of our sequence is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**7. Assemble the Final Order:**\nNow, we combine the sorted groups: {Group A} < {Group B}\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n**1. Analyze the Question's Core Task**\nThe question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds based on the yield of the para-brominated product. Specifically, it's about the increasing *weight fraction* (or percentage) of the para-isomer among all possible monobrominated products. The reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n**2. The Key Principle: Substituent Effects**\nThe substituent already on the benzene ring dictates where the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br⁺) will add. This is known as the directing effect. Substituents are categorized as either ortho-, para-directors or meta-directors.\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directors** guide the incoming group to the ortho (2,6) and para (4) positions. These compounds will produce a significant amount of para-product.\n*   **Meta-directors** guide the incoming group to the meta (3,5) positions. These compounds produce very little ortho and para product.\n\nThis primary classification allows us to create two distinct groups.\n\n**3. Classify Each Substance**\n\n*   **Substance 1: C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)**\n    *   -CH₃ is an alkyl group. It's weakly activating and an **ortho-, para-director**.\n*   **Substance 2: C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl Benzoate)**\n    *   -COOC₂H₅ has a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to the ring. This group is electron-withdrawing and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Substance 3: C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**\n    *   -Cl is a halogen. It's deactivating due to induction but is an **ortho-, para-director** because its lone pairs can participate in resonance.\n*   **Substance 4: C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)**\n    *   -NO₂ is a very strong electron-withdrawing group and a powerful **meta-director**.\n*   **Substance 5: C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)**\n    *   -C₂H₅ is an alkyl group. It's weakly activating and an **ortho-, para-director**.\n*   **Substance 6: C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic Acid)**\n    *   -COOH has a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to the ring. This group is electron-withdrawing and a **meta-director**.\n\n**4. Initial Sorting into Two Groups**\nBased on the classification, the substances that are meta-directors will have the lowest para-isomer yield. The ortho-, para-directors will have the highest.\n\n*   **Low Para-Yield Group (Meta-directors):** {Nitrobenzene (4), Benzoic Acid (6), Ethyl Benzoate (2)}\n*   **High Para-Yield Group (Ortho-, Para-directors):** {Toluene (1), Ethylbenzene (5), Chlorobenzene (3)}\n\nThe final sequence must start with the meta-directors and end with the ortho-, para-directors.\n\n**5. Rank the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\nFor meta-directors, the very small amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A more strongly deactivating group will suppress para substitution more effectively.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ (strongest) > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅ (strong to moderate).\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is the opposite of this strength:\n    **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic Acid (6) < Ethyl Benzoate (2)**.\n\n**6. Rank the Ortho-, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these, we need to compare the factors that favor the para position over the ortho position. The two main factors are sterics and electronics.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This bulkiness hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, thus increasing the proportion of substitution at the para position.\n    *   Therefore: **Para yield of Toluene (1) < Para yield of Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n\n*   **Comparing Chlorobenzene (3) with the others:** The -Cl group has a very strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect. This effect is distance-dependent, meaning it deactivates the close ortho positions much more strongly than the distant para position. This strong electronic preference for the para position leads to a very high para/ortho ratio. The para-isomer is often the major product by a large margin (e.g., ~89% in bromination). This effect is typically stronger than the steric effect of alkyl groups.\n    *   Therefore: **Para yield of Ethylbenzene (5) < Para yield of Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n*   The complete order for this group is:\n    **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**7. Assemble the Final Order**\nCombine the rankings of the two groups:\n\n(Low Yield Group) < (High Yield Group)\n**(4 < 6 < 2)** < **(1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete sequence, in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer, is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n**1. Analyze the Goal of the Question**\nThe core task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of *increasing* percentage yield of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination.\n\n**2. The Fundamental Principle: Substituent Effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS)**\nThe substituent already on the benzene ring governs the position of the incoming electrophile (Br⁺). We need to classify each substituent based on its directing effect.\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho (2,6) and para (4) to the substituent. Compounds with these groups will have a relatively high yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions meta (3,5) to the substituent. They produce very little of the ortho and para isomers.\n\n**3. Classify Each of the Six Substituents**\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n*   **1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** -CH₃ is an alkyl group. It is a weakly activating **ortho-, para-director**.\n*   **2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl Benzoate):** The -COOC₂H₅ group has a carbonyl (C=O) bonded to the ring, making it electron-withdrawing. It is a deactivating **meta-director**.\n*   **3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is a deactivating group but directs substitution to the **ortho and para** positions due to resonance donation from its lone pairs.\n*   **4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** -NO₂ is a very strong electron-withdrawing group. It is a strongly deactivating **meta-director**.\n*   **5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** -C₂H₅ is an alkyl group. It is a weakly activating **ortho-, para-director**.\n*   **6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic Acid):** The -COOH group has a carbonyl (C=O) bonded to the ring, making it electron-withdrawing. It is a deactivating **meta-director**.\n\n**4. Initial Broad Sorting**\nBased on the classification, we can separate the compounds into two groups. The meta-directors will have the lowest para-yield, and the ortho-, para-directors will have the highest.\n\n*   **Low Para-Yield Group (Meta-directors):** {Nitrobenzene (4), Benzoic Acid (6), Ethyl Benzoate (2)}\n*   **High Para-Yield Group (Ortho-, Para-directors):** {Toluene (1), Ethylbenzene (5), Chlorobenzene (3)}\n\nThe final sequence will be of the form: (Low Yield Group) < (High Yield Group).\n\n**5. Detailed Ranking within the Low Para-Yield Group (4, 6, 2)**\nFor meta-directors, the para-yield is minuscule but not zero. The yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group; a stronger deactivating group suppresses para-substitution more effectively.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ (strongest) > -COOH (strong) > -COOC₂H₅ (moderate/strong)**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this deactivating strength.\n*   The ranking is: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic Acid (6) < Ethyl Benzoate (2)**.\n\n**6. Detailed Ranking within the High Para-Yield Group (1, 5, 3)**\nHere, we compare the factors that determine the para-to-ortho product ratio. The main factors are steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The key difference is the size of the alkyl group. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, thus increasing the proportion of substitution that occurs at the more accessible para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   This gives the order: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n\n*   **Comparing the Alkylbenzenes (1, 5) with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chloro group is deactivating overall, but its directing effect is dominated by a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect that is distance-dependent. This effect strongly deactivates the nearby ortho positions much more than it deactivates the distant para position. This powerful electronic factor leads to a very high selectivity for the para position, generally higher than for alkylbenzenes.\n    *   This gives the order: **Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n*   Combining the rankings for this group, we get: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**7.
