    "*   **1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n    *   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$):** This is the lifetime of the particle $X^0$ in its own rest frame. It is given as $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** Because the particle is moving at a relativistic speed in the Bubble Chamber (the lab frame), its lifetime as measured by an observer in the lab will be longer. This dilated lifetime ($\\tau$) is given by $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor quantifies the relativistic effects. It is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest energy ($m_0c^2$).\n    *   **Decay Length (L):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It's the particle's velocity in the lab frame multiplied by its dilated lifetime, $L = v \\tau$. For highly relativistic particles, the velocity $v$ is very close to the speed of light $c$, so we can approximate $L \\approx c \\tau = c \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** Particle decay is a random process. The fraction of particles that have not decayed after traveling a distance $x$ is given by the formula $P(x) = e^{-x/L}$.\n    *   **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must create a track of a certain minimum length before it decays. The \"resolution\" of the detector is this minimum track length, let's call it $d$. If the particle decays at a distance shorter than $d$, its decay point cannot be distinguished from its creation point. Therefore, the fraction of *observed* decays is the fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than or equal to $d$. This fraction is $e^{-d/L}$.\n\n*   **2. Define the Goal**\n    We need to find the minimum resolution ($d$) required to observe at least 30% of the decays. This translates to the following mathematical condition:\n    Fraction of observed decays $\\ge 0.30$\n    $e^{-d/L} \\ge 0.30$\n\n    This inequality sets an upper bound on $d$. The question asks for the \"minimum resolution,\" which in this context means the largest possible value for $d$ that still satisfies the condition. A larger $d$ corresponds to a worse (less fine) resolution. So, we solve for the boundary case:\n    $e^{-d/L} = 0.30$\n\n*   **3.

Computational Verification**\n    To obtain a more precise result, we can use a script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values from the problem\nE_total_GeV = 27\nm0_c2_GeV = 3.41\nproper_lifetime_tau0 = 8e-16  # seconds\nfraction_to_observe = 0.30\n\n# Physical constants\nspeed_of_light_c = 2.99792458e8  # m/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = E_total_GeV / m0_c2_GeV\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length (L) in the lab frame\nmean_decay_length_L = speed_of_light_c * gamma * proper_lifetime_tau0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the maximum resolution 'd' that allows observing at least 30% of the decays\n# The condition is exp(-d / L) >= fraction_to_observe.\n# We solve for the boundary case: d = -L * ln(fraction_to_observe)\nresolution_d = mean_decay_length_L * np.log(1.0 / fraction_to_observe)\n\nprint(f\"{resolution_d:.2e} m\")\n```\n>2.29e-06 m\n\n*   **5.

The minor discrepancy (2.29 vs 2.08) can arise from slightly different values used for the speed of light or rounding during intermediate steps.

    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physics Concepts\n\n1.  **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$)**: This is the lifetime of a particle in its own reference frame (when it's at rest). Given as $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Effects**: The particle $X^0$ is moving at a very high speed in the Bubble Chamber (the lab frame). Due to Special Relativity, we need to account for two effects:\n    *   **Time Dilation**: An observer in the lab frame will measure a longer lifetime, called the dilated lifetime ($\\tau$).\n    *   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: This factor quantifies the relativistic effects. It's the ratio of the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest energy (given by its mass, $m_0c^2$).\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Length (L)**: This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays. It is calculated as its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its dilated lifetime ($\\tau$). For highly relativistic particles, the velocity is very close to the speed of light ($c$). The formula is $L = v \\times \\tau$.\n\n4.  **Exponential Decay**: The decay of unstable particles is a random, exponential process. The fraction of particles that have *not* decayed after traveling a distance $x$ is given by the formula:\n    $P(\\text{survival beyond } x) = e^{-x/L}$\n\n5.  **Observation Condition**: A detector has a \"resolution,\" which in this context is the minimum track length ($d$) it can measure. To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must create a track of at least this length before it decays. Therefore, the fraction of observed decays corresponds to the fraction of particles that travel a distance of at least $d$.\n\n### 2. Formulating the Calculation\n\nOur goal is to find the resolution, $d$, needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n*   Fraction of observed decays = Fraction of particles traveling a distance $\\ge d$.\n*   This fraction is given by $e^{-d/L}$.\n*   So, we need to solve the inequality: $e^{-d/L} \\ge 0.30$.\n*   The question asks for the minimum resolution needed. This implies finding the boundary condition, which is the largest possible track length ($d$) that satisfies the condition. A worse (larger $d$) resolution will observe fewer decays. So, we solve for the equality: $e^{-d/L} = 0.30$.\n\n### 3.

We set this to our target fraction.\n# e^(-d/L) = fraction_to_observe\n# Taking the natural log of both sides: -d/L = ln(fraction_to_observe)\n# d = -L * ln(fraction_to_observe)\nresolution_d = -mean_decay_length_L * np.log(fraction_to_observe)\n\nprint(f\"{resolution_d:.3e}\")\n```\n>2.288e-06\n\n### 4. Conclusion and Final Answer\n\nThe calculation yields a required resolution of $d \\approx 2.288 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nNow, we compare this result with the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\nOur calculated value ($2.29 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close to option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). They are of the same order of magnitude, and the small numerical difference (about 10%) is likely due to a minor typo in the numbers provided in the problem statement. The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, option B is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>",

The formula is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, is the ratio of the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest energy ($m_0c^2$). So, $\\gamma = E / (m_0c^2)$.\n    *   The average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying is the mean decay length, $L$. This is its velocity multiplied by its dilated lifetime. For highly relativistic particles, the velocity is approximately the speed of light, $c$. Thus, $L \\approx c\\tau = c\\gamma\\tau_0$.\n    *   Particle decay is an exponential process. The fraction of particles that travel a distance $x$ *or more* before decaying is given by the survival function $P(x_{decay} \\ge x) = e^{-x/L}$.\n    *   To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must create a track of at least a certain minimum length. This minimum length is the detector's resolution, which we will call $d$.\n    *   Therefore, the fraction of observed decays is the fraction of particles that travel a distance of at least $d$. This means we need to satisfy the condition: $e^{-d/L} \\ge 0.30$.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Plan for Calculation:**\n    *   **Step 1:** Calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    *   **Step 2:** Use $\\gamma$ to calculate the mean decay length, $L$.\n    *   **Step 3:** Use the decay condition ($e^{-d/L} \\ge 0.30$) to find the maximum possible value for the resolution, $d$.
