    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's determine its molecular formula by counting the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms.\n*   (CH3)2C= part: 2 methyl groups (2 C, 6 H) + 1 C on the main chain. Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n*   =CH- part: 1 C, 1 H.\n*   -CH2- part: 1 C, 2 H.\n*   -CH(CH3)- part: 1 C on the chain, 1 H on the chain, and 1 methyl group (1 C, 3 H). Total: 2 C, 4 H.\n*   -CH2- part: 1 C, 2 H.\n*   -CH=C(CH3)2 part: 1 C in =CH, 1 H in =CH, 1 C in =C, and 2 methyl groups (2 C, 6 H). Total: 4 C, 7 H. Wait, the structure is `-CH=C(CH3)2`. So valency is satisfied.\n    *   Let's recount for this part: `-CH=`: 1 C, 1 H. `=C(CH3)2`: 1 C, 2x(CH3) = 3 C, 6H. Total is 1C+1H from -CH= and 3C+6H from C(CH3)2, giving 4C, 7H for this segment. No, let's break it down by groups again.\n\nLet's count atoms by group contribution to the overall molecule:\n*   (CH3)2C=: 3 C, 6 H\n*   CH: 1 C, 1 H\n*   CH2: 1 C, 2 H\n*   CH(CH3): 2 C, 4 H\n*   CH2: 1 C, 2 H\n*   CH: 1 C, 1 H\n*   C(CH3)2: 3 C, 6 H\n\nTotal Carbons (n) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\nTotal Hydrogens (m) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\nThe molecular formula is C12H22.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Bonds**\n\nTo calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, we need to count each type of bond.\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure `C=C...C=C` clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **C-C bonds**: For an open-chain (non-cyclic) molecule, the total number of bonds between carbon atoms (single and multiple) is `n-1`, where `n` is the number of carbon atoms. Here, n=12, so there are 11 bonds between carbon atoms. Since there are 2 C=C bonds, the number of C-C single bonds is 11 - 2 = 9.\n\nSummary of bonds:\n*   Number of C-C bonds = 9\n*   Number of C=C bonds = 2\n*   Number of C-H bonds = 22\n\n**3.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula**\n    First, we determine the chemical formula of the molecule `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n    *   Count Carbon (C) atoms: 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 carbon atoms.\n    *   Count Hydrogen (H) atoms: 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from (CH3)2) = 22 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n2.  **Count the Bonds**\n    Next, we count the number of each type of bond within the molecule.\n    *   **C-H bonds**: The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n    *   **C=C bonds**: The structure contains two double bonds, so there are 2 C=C bonds.\n    *   **C-C bonds**: For any acyclic (non-ring) hydrocarbon with `n` carbon atoms, there are a total of `n-1` bonds between the carbon atoms. Here, `n=12`, so there are `12 - 1 = 11` total carbon-carbon bonds. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single bonds is `11 - 2 = 9`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f°)**\n    The enthalpy of formation is the energy change when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states (`12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)`). The calculation using bond energies follows this principle:\n    ΔH_f° = (Energy to break reactant bonds) - (Energy released forming product bonds)\n    Which is equivalent to:\n    ΔH_f° = (Σ Enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Σ Bond energies of the compound)\n\n    *   **Step 3a: Enthalpy of atomization of elements.** This is the energy required to convert 12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of gaseous hydrogen into gaseous atoms.\n        *   For Carbon: 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n        *   For Hydrogen (breaking H-H bonds): 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n        *   **Total input energy = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ**\n\n    *   **Step 3b: Total bond energy of the compound.** This is the energy that would be released if all the bonds in one mole of C12H22 were formed from gaseous atoms (or, equivalently, the energy needed to break them).\n        *   From 9 C-C bonds: 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n        *   From 2 C=C bonds: 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n        *   From 22 C-H bonds: 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n        *   **Total energy of compound's bonds = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ**\n\n    *   **Step 3c: Final calculation of ΔH_f° in kJ/mol.**\n        *   ΔH_f° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n4.  **Convert to the Units in the Options**\n    The answer `1900 kJ/mol` does not match options B or C directly. Option A is in kJ/g, so let's convert our answer.\n    *   Calculate the molar mass of C12H22: (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n    *   Convert ΔH_f° from kJ/mol to kJ/g:\n        `ΔH_f° (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g`\n\n    This value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
