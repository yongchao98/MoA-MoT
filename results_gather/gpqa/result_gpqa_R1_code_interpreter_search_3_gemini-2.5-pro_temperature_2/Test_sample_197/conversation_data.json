    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:**\n    In the solution, cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes. The total cobalt concentration, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n    *   Free ion: Co²⁺\n    *   Complex 1: [Co(SCN)]⁺\n    *   Complex 2: [Co(SCN)₂] (the blue complex)\n    *   Complex 3: [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n    *   Complex 4: [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\n    So, the total cobalt concentration is:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n2.  **Use the overall stability constants (β):**\n    The formation of each complex is defined by its overall stability constant (βₙ):\n    *   [Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]\n    *   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²\n    *   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³\n    *   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴\n\n3.  **Express the total cobalt concentration in terms of [Co²⁺]:**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 2 into the equation for c(Co) from step 1:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + (β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) + (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) + (β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) + (β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n    Factor out the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺]:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n4.  **Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex:**\n    We want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]. This is the concentration of [Co(SCN)₂] divided by the total cobalt concentration, c(Co). Let's call this fraction α₂.\n    α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n    Now, substitute the expressions for [[Co(SCN)₂]] and c(Co):\n    α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n    The [Co²⁺] term cancels out from the numerator and the denominator:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n5.  **Plug in the given values and calculate:**\n    We are given:\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M (Note: Since [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M is much larger than c(Co) = 0.01 M, we can assume the free thiocyanate concentration is approximately equal to its total concentration).\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    Now, let's perform the calculation using a Python script.\n```python\n# Given values\nSCN_conc = 0.1  # M\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Calculate the terms in the denominator\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = beta1 * SCN_conc\nterm2 = beta2 * SCN_conc**2\nterm3 = beta3 * SCN_conc**3\nterm4 = beta4 * SCN_conc**4\n\n# The numerator is term2, which corresponds to the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator = term2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms, often called the alpha function denominator or side-reaction coefficient\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2)\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f'{percentage=}')\n```\n<execute_result>\npercentage=16.916180326482276\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the fraction of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is approximately 0.169, which is 16.9%.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here's a step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of a specific cobalt complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) which is `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify All Species:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free cobalt ion `[Co²⁺]` and all the complexes it forms with thiocyanate `(SCN⁻)`. The possible species are:\n    *   `Co²⁺` (free ion)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (mono-complex)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂]` (di-complex, the one we are interested in)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (tri-complex)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (tetra-complex)\n\n    Therefore, the total concentration of cobalt is:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n3.  **Relate Species Concentrations using Stability Constants (β):** The overall stability constants (`βₙ`) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion `[Co²⁺]` and the free ligand `[SCN⁻]`.\n\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n4.  **Formulate the Percentage Calculation:** We want to calculate the percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n    `Percentage = ( [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co) ) * 100`\n\n5.  **Develop a General Formula:** Substitute the expressions from step 3 into the equation for `c(Co)` from step 2:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n    Factor out the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n    Now substitute this and the expression for `[Co(SCN)₂]` into the percentage formula's fraction part (this fraction is often denoted as `α₂`):\n    `Fraction (α₂) = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ( [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) )`\n\n    Notice that `[Co²⁺]` is in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This is a key simplification. The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is also not directly needed to find the *percentage* or *fraction*.\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n6.  **Assumption on Ligand Concentration:** The total thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, and the total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M. Since the ligand is in 10-fold excess, the amount of SCN⁻ that gets bound into complexes will be relatively small compared to the total amount. Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` as equal to its initial concentration, 0.1 M.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Result:** Now, plug the given numerical values into the formula for `α₂`.\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   `β₁` = 9\n    *   `β₂` = 40\n    *   `β₃` = 63\n    *   `β₄` = 16\n\n    This calculation can be done step-by-step, but to ensure accuracy, it's best performed with a calculator or a simple script. I will use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Define the given constants and concentrations\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nSCN_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# Calculate the numerator of the fraction, which corresponds to the [Co(SCN)2] term\nnumerator = beta2 * (SCN_conc**2)\n\n# Calculate the denominator, which is the sum of terms for all species\n# Term for Co2+ is 1\n# Term for [Co(SCN)]+ is beta1 * SCN_conc\n# Term for [Co(SCN)2] is beta2 * SCN_conc**2\n# Term for [Co(SCN)3]- is beta3 * SCN_conc**3\n# Term for [Co(SCN)4]2- is beta4 * SCN_conc**4\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * SCN_conc**1) + (beta2 * SCN_conc**2) + (beta3 * SCN_conc**3) + (beta4 * SCN_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<execute_result>\n16.916180326482276\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 16.92%.

    "This problem requires us to calculate the distribution of cobalt species in a solution containing a ligand (thiocyanate, SCN⁻).
