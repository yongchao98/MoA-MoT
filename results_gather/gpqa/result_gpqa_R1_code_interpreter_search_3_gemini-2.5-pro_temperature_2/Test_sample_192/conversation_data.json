    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Relationship:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars per unit range of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, varies as `1/plx^5`. We can write this as a proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, varies with distance `r`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax (plx) and Distance (r):**\n    The parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. The fundamental relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    where `r` is the distance and `plx` is the parallax.\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Derivatives:**\n    To convert a derivative with respect to parallax (`d/d(plx)`) to a derivative with respect to distance (`d/dr`), we can use the chain rule:\n    `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr`\n\n5.  **Calculate the term `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance.\n    `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`\n    Taking the derivative with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    For scaling relationships, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can say `d(plx)/dr ∝ 1/r²`.\n\n6.  **Substitute the Relationships into the Chain Rule Equation:**\n    Now we substitute our known proportionalities into the chain rule equation from step 4.\n    *   From step 1: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n    *   From step 5: `d(plx)/dr ∝ 1/r²` (ignoring the negative sign for the proportionality)\n\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (r):**\n    The expression for `dN/dr` currently contains both `plx` and `r`. We must convert `plx` to `r` using the relationship from step 3 (`plx = 1/r`).\n    Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the term `1/plx^5`:\n    `1/plx^5 = 1 / (1/r)^5 = r^5`\n\n    Now, substitute this back into our expression for `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r²)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Final Expression:**\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance changes as `r^3`.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dr`) and the distance (`r`), given the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) and the parallax (`plx`).\n\n1.  **Given relationship:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax varies as `1/plx^5`. We can write this as a proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **Fundamental relationship between distance and parallax:**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`):\n    `plx = 1/r` or `r = 1/plx`\n\n3.  **Connecting the differentials using the chain rule:**\n    We want to find `dN/dr`. We can relate `dN/dr` to `dN/d(plx)` using the chain rule of calculus:\n    `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr`\n\n4.  **Calculate `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance.\n    Since `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    When dealing with proportionality, we are concerned with the powers of the variables, not the constant factors or the sign. So, we can say:\n    `d(plx)/dr ∝ 1/r²`\n\n5.  **Substitute the relationships:**\n    Now we substitute the proportionalities back into the chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n6.  **Express everything in terms of distance (`r`):**\n    Our current expression has both `plx` and `r`. We need to replace `plx` with its equivalent in terms of `r` using the relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n    `plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = (r⁻¹)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n7.  **Final Simplification:**\n    Substitute `plx⁻⁵ = r⁵` back into the proportionality for `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as `r³`.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which can be written as the differential `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, is related to the distance `r`.\n\n3.  **Establish the Core Relationship:**\n    The parallax of a star (`plx`) is inversely proportional to its distance (`r`).

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which we can write as `dN/d(plx)`, varies as `1/plx^5`.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Relationship:** The problem states that the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) varies as the inverse fifth power of the parallax (`plx`).
