    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Observations:**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** There are two distinct peaks for a single proton (the α-proton). This immediately tells us that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. The fact that the integrals are roughly equal means these two environments are populated in an approximately 1:1 ratio. The problem states we can rule out spin-spin coupling, so the splitting is not due to adjacent protons.\n    *   **LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry):** This technique provides two key pieces of information.\n        *   **LC (Chromatography):** The sample separates into two distinct peaks. This confirms the presence of two different chemical species that have different interactions with the chromatography column. The equal intensities of the peaks corroborate the NMR data, suggesting a ~1:1 mixture. The fact that the peaks are still resolved at elevated temperature indicates that the two species do not interconvert rapidly, i.e., there is a significant energy barrier between them.\n        *   **MS (Mass Spectrometry):** Both peaks yield the *same* mass spectrum, which corresponds to the expected mass of the target molecule. This is a critical clue. It means the two chemical species are **isomers**—they have the same chemical formula and the same molecular weight, but a different arrangement of atoms.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options Based on the Evidence:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   Because they are chemically distinct, they would give different signals in an NMR spectrum. This is consistent with seeing two peaks for the α-proton.\n        *   Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by chromatography (like LC). This is consistent with seeing two LC peaks.\n        *   By definition, they are isomers, so they have the same mass. This is consistent with the MS data.\n        *   In the context of a peptide, a very common form of diastereomerism is *cis-trans* isomerism about the amide (peptide) bond. Due to the partial double-bond character of the C-N bond, rotation is restricted, creating two stable conformers (atropisomers): *cis* and *trans*. The α-proton is adjacent to this bond, and its chemical environment is different in the *cis* vs. the *trans* form, leading to two NMR peaks. This phenomenon is especially pronounced for peptide bonds involving proline, where the *cis* and *trans* forms can have very similar energies, leading to ~1:1 mixtures. This explanation fits all the experimental observations perfectly.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.\n        *   Therefore, they would give a single, identical signal in a standard ¹H NMR experiment and would co-elute as a single peak in a standard (achiral) LC system.\n        *   This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data, which clearly show two distinct species.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor from the synthesis would almost certainly have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass.\n        *   The MS data shows that both peaks have the same mass as the expected product. This directly contradicts the presence of a precursor impurity (unless it happens to be an isomer, which brings us back to option A).\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   \"Double coupling\" is a procedural term in solid-phase peptide synthesis, where the coupling reaction is performed a second time to ensure the reaction goes to completion. It does not describe a side product.\n        *   If it were to mean an accidental addition of an extra amino acid, the resulting molecule would have a much higher mass. This contradicts the MS data.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of two NMR signals for one proton, two separable peaks on LC, and an identical mass for both species strongly points to a mixture of isomers. Since the isomers are distinguishable by NMR and LC, they must be diastereomers. The most common and chemically sound explanation for this phenomenon in a peptide is restricted rotation around the amide bond, leading to a mixture of *cis* and *trans* diastereomers (atropisomers).\n\n<<<A>>>"
