    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the physical system:** The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential energy for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three dimensions.\n\n2.  **Recall the energy eigenvalues:** The Schrödinger equation for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be solved by separation of variables in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. The total energy $E$ is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators:\n    $E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n    The energy levels for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$.\n    Therefore, the total energy for the 3D system is:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_n = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy formula simplifies to:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n3.  **Determine the energy of the third excited state:**\n    *   The **ground state** is the state with the lowest possible energy, which corresponds to the smallest value of $n$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z$ must be non-negative integers, the smallest value for $n$ is $0$ (when $n_x=n_y=n_z=0$). This is the ground state.\n    *   The **first excited state** corresponds to the next lowest energy, which is for $n=1$.\n    *   The **second excited state** corresponds to $n=2$.\n    *   The **third excited state** corresponds to $n=3$.\n\n    Now, we can calculate the energy for the third excited state ($n=3$):\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\n4.  **Determine the degeneracy of the third excited state:** The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3.\n\n    This is a combinatorial problem. We can list the possible combinations:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: $(3,0,0)$. This can be arranged in 3 ways: $(3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3)$.\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: $(2,1,0)$. This can be arranged in $3! = 6$ ways: $(2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2)$.\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1: $(1,1,1)$. This can be arranged in only 1 way.\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ for a level $n$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy. This matches option A.\n\nI can confirm this with a simple Python script.\n```python\ndef calculate_degeneracy(n_total):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the degeneracy for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator\n    for a given principal quantum number n.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate through all possible non-negative integer values for nx, ny, nz\n    for nx in range(n_total + 1):\n        for ny in range(n_total + 1 - nx):\n            nz = n_total - nx - ny\n            if nz >= 0:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\n# The third excited state corresponds to n=3\nn_level = 3\ndegeneracy = calculate_degeneracy(n_level)\n\n# The energy is E_n = (n + 3/2) * hbar * omega\n# For n=3, E_3 = (3 + 3/2) * hbar * omega = (9/2) * hbar * omega\nenergy_value_str = \"(9/2) \\\\hbar \\\\omega\"\n\nprint(f\"Energy: {energy_value_str}\")\nprint(f\"Degeneracy: {degeneracy}\")\n```\n>>>\nEnergy: (9/2) \\hbar \\omega\nDegeneracy: 10\nThe code confirms that for n=3, the degeneracy is 10. The energy is $(3+3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nFinal answer matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user's question is about the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Identify the system and its energy levels:** The potential is $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2r^2$, which corresponds to a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.
