    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It has one chiral center at carbon C5, with the (S) configuration. As it is a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The ketone is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n    *   This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n\n3.  **Products:** The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 remains unaffected, so its configuration is still (S).\n    *   The new chiral center at C3 can have either an (R) or (S) configuration. The hydride ion can attack the carbonyl from two different faces, leading to both stereoisomers at C3.\n    *   Therefore, two products are formed:\n        *   Product A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   Product B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same connectivity but different stereochemistry at one of two chiral centers. This makes them **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry and does not have any chiral centers.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The dione is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n\n3.  **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these isomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they are formed in equal amounts as a racemic mixture. (Product C and Product D).\n        *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer (just flipped 180 degrees). So, there is only one meso compound. (Product E).\n    *   The meso compound (E) is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair (C and D).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces a total of **three stereoisomeric products**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Mixture for HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture contains five distinct compounds:\n*   From Reaction I: Two diastereomers (A and B).\n*   From Reaction II: A pair of enantiomers (C and D) and their meso diastereomer (E).\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like C and D) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they are **not separable** and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like A and B, or E vs. the C/D pair) have different physical properties and **are separable**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will have different polarities and retention times.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n1.  Peak 1: Product A, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n2.  Peak 2: Product B, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. (Separable from A).\n3.  Peak 3: The racemic mixture of Product C and D, (2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. (Not separable from each other).\n4.  Peak 4: Product E, meso-pentane-2,4-diol. (Separable from the C/D pair).\n\nThus, on a normal-phase HPLC column, we will observe **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   This technique can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n*   The mixture contains 5 distinct stereoisomers.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n1.  Peak 1: Product A, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n2.  Peak 2: Product B, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n3.  Peak 3: Product C, (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n4.  Peak 4: Product D, (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. (Separable from its enantiomer C).\n5.  Peak 5: Product E, meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\nThus, on a chiral HPLC column, we will observe **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC: 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC: 5\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
