    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to find the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, denoted as $L_1/L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a perfect black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where:\n    *   `R` is the star's radius.\n    *   `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the star's effective surface temperature.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars as:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information for the Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 ($R_1 = 1.5 R_2$). Therefore, the ratio of the radii is:\n    $R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$\n    Squaring this ratio gives:\n    $(R_1 / R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   We are told that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{max,obs}$) are the same for both stars.\n    *   The emitted peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max,emit}$) is related to the star's surface temperature (T) by Wien's Displacement Law:\n        $\\lambda_{max,emit} = b / T$\n        where `b` is Wien's constant.\n    *   The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity due to the Doppler effect.

    "The user has provided a physics problem and wants a solution. I will break down the problem into steps, apply the relevant physical laws, perform the necessary calculations, and select the correct answer from the given options.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to determine the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Luminosity (Stefan-Boltzmann Law):** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a perfect black body, is given by the formula $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where `R` is the star's radius, `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the star's surface temperature.\n    *   **Peak Emission Wavelength (Wien's Displacement Law):** The wavelength at which a black body's emission is most intense ($\\lambda_{emit}$) is inversely proportional to its temperature: $\\lambda_{emit} = b/T$, where `b` is Wien's constant.\n    *   **Doppler Effect for Light:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$). For a source with radial velocity `v` (positive for recession, negative for approach) relative to the observer, the relativistic Doppler effect formula is:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$\n        where `c` is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    We can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars as:\n    $ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} $\n    The constants ($4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$) cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n    $ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n4.  **Incorporate Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n        Therefore, $\\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** The information that $M_1 = 1.5 \\times M_2$ is not directly used in the Stefan-Boltzmann law and is likely extraneous information intended to distract.\n    *   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part. We need to find $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$. We can find this from the information about the peak wavelengths.\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio from Wavelengths:**\n    *   From Wien's Law, $T = b/\\lambda_{emit}$, so the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{emit,2}}{\\lambda_{emit,1}}$.\n    *   We need to relate the emitted wavelengths to the observed wavelengths using the Doppler effect. The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    *   **For Star_1:** Radial velocity $v_1 = 0$. There is no Doppler shift.\n        $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emit,1}$\n    *   **For Star_2:** Radial velocity $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s}$. Let $\\beta = v_2/c$.\n        $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emit,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\beta}{1 - \\beta}}$\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$:\n        $\\lambda_{emit,1} = \\lambda_{emit,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\beta}{1 - \\beta}}$\n    *   Now we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for the temperature ratio:\n        $\\frac{\\lambda_{emit,2}}{\\lambda_{emit,1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\beta}{1 - \\beta}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\beta}{1 + \\beta}}$\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\beta}{1 + \\beta}}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = (2.25) \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\beta}{1 + \\beta}}\\right)^4 $\n    $ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{1 - \\beta}{1 + \\beta}\\right)^2 $\n\n7.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    We need to calculate the value of $\\beta$ and then the final ratio.\n    *   $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700,000 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c \\approx 299,792,458 \\text{ m/s}$ (speed of light)\n    *   $\\beta = v_2 / c$\n    The calculation is sensitive, so using a script is ideal for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\n# (R1/R2)^2\nradius_ratio_squared = 1.5**2\n# Radial velocity of Star 2 in m/s\nv2 = 700 * 1000\n# Speed of light in m/s\nc = 299792458\n\n# Calculate beta = v/c\nbeta = v2 / c\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * ((1-beta)/(1+beta))^2\nluminosity_ratio = radius_ratio_squared * np.power((1 - beta) / (1 + beta), 2)\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\nThe output `2.22908325509156` confirms the result of the derivation.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229.

    "The calculation has been performed and verified. The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  The luminosity ratio is given by the formula: $ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $.\n2.  Given $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, the radius term is $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n3.  The temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$ is found by considering that the observed peak wavelengths are equal. Due to the Doppler effect from Star_2's radial velocity ($v_2 = 700$ km/s), the emitted wavelengths are different. This leads to the relationship $ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\beta}{1 + \\beta}} $, where $\\beta = v_2/c$.\n4.  Substituting this into the luminosity ratio gives: $ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{1 - \\beta}{1 + \\beta}\\right)^2 $.\n5.
