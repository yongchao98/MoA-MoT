    "*   **Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one). A cyanohydrin has a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a nitrile (-CN) group attached to the same carbon atom.\n    2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** The reaction proceeds in two steps:\n        *   **Step 1: Nucleophilic attack.** The cyanide ion (CN⁻), from the dissociation of NaCN, is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond and forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n            `CH3-CO-CH2-CH3 + CN⁻ → CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n        *   **Step 2: Protonation.** The negatively charged oxygen atom of the alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final stable hydroxyl group. This requires a proton source (an acid).\n            `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3 + H⁺ → CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n    3.  **Evaluate the options for A:**\n        *   **H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion):** This represents an acidic aqueous solution, which is a suitable source of protons (H⁺) for the second step. The reaction is typically performed by mixing the ketone and NaCN, and then adding acid in a subsequent step (acidic workup).\n        *   **NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite):** This reagent is used to form bisulfite addition products, which is a different reaction used for the separation and purification of carbonyl compounds. It is not the correct reagent for forming a cyanohydrin in this context.\n    4.  **Conclusion for A:** The correct reagent 'A' is H₃O⁺. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction. The rest of the molecule (the alpha-hydroxy group and the aromatic part) remains unchanged.\n    2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires water and is catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating. The overall reaction is:\n        `R-CN + 2 H₂O --(catalyst)--> R-COOH + NH₃` (or NH₄⁺ in acidic conditions, or NH₃ in basic conditions).\n    3.  **Evaluate the options for B:**\n        *   **HCl (hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong acid. Strong acids are effective catalysts for nitrile hydrolysis.\n        *   **CH₃COOH (acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. While it can theoretically catalyze the reaction, the process would be extremely slow and inefficient. Nitrile hydrolysis typically requires harsh conditions, which means using a strong acid or a strong base.\n    4.  **Conclusion for B:** The most suitable reagent 'B' for efficient hydrolysis is the strong acid, HCl.\n\n*   **Final Decision:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   Combining these, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
