    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure and substituent relationships:\n*   The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    1.  An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position 1.\n    2.  A **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at position 2.\n    3.  A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position 3.\n*   The substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern (vicinal).\n*   **Relative positions:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nUnderstanding how each substituent directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: A strong activating group, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: A weak activating group, ortho, para-director. Due to its large size, it sterically hinders the ortho positions, strongly favoring para substitution.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: A strong deactivating group, meta-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: A strong activating group, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium)**: A strong deactivating group, meta-director (formed from -NH2 in strong acid).\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: A strong deactivating group, meta-director. It's also a useful blocking group that can be removed later.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Routes (The Options)**\n\nThe goal is a \"high-yield synthesis,\" which means we should favor reactions with high regioselectivity and avoid creating hard-to-separate mixtures.\n\nLet's systematically evaluate each option.\n\n**Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n*   Step (i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene. Correct.\n*   Step (ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline. Correct.\n*   Step (iii) Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails with anilines because the lone pair on the nitrogen atom complexes with the Lewis acid (AlCl3), strongly deactivating the ring and preventing the reaction. Therefore, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\nThis route uses a blocking group strategy, which is often effective for controlling regiochemistry.\n*   Step (i) Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. Correct.\n*   Step (ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The bulky t-butyl group strongly directs the sulfonation to the para position. This is a correct and high-yield step.\n*   Step (iii) 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration.\n    *   We have a -tBu group (o,p-director) at C4 and an -SO3H group (m-director) at C1.\n    *   The -tBu group directs the incoming NO2+ to its ortho positions (C3 and C5).\n    *   The -SO3H group directs the incoming NO2+ to its meta positions (C3 and C5).\n    *   Both groups direct the substitution to the same positions. This is an excellent, high-yield step. The product is **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This intermediate has the crucial *ortho* relationship between the t-butyl and nitro groups, which matches the target.\n*   However, the rest of the sequence is problematic. To get the final product, we would need to replace the -SO3H group with an -OH (e.g., via alkali fusion), then convert it to -OEt. This process would yield `4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`, which after etherification gives `1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene`. This is an isomer of the target, but not the target itself (the OEt and tBu groups are para, not ortho). Also, step (vi) `HNO3/H2SO4` on the diazonium salt from step (v) is chemically nonsensical. Therefore, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Option A:** The sequence of reactions is chemically illogical. For example, step (iv) is diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), which requires a primary amine (-NH2). The product from the preceding steps is a nitro-sulfonic acid derivative, which cannot be diazotized. Therefore, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ...**\nLet's analyze this sequence step-by-step.\n*   Step (i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**. Correct.\n*   Step (ii) tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director, but due to sterics, the major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. The ortho isomer is a minor product. For a high-yield synthesis, we proceed with the major product.\n*   Step (iii) 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → **4-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine. Correct.\n*   Step (iv) 4-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration. This is the key step.\n    *   In the strong acid medium (H2SO4), the amine group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n    *   The anilinium ion is a strong deactivator and a **meta-director**.\n    *   The tert-butyl group is an activator and an **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   We have a competition: -NH3+ at C1 directs to C3/C5. The -tBu at C4 directs to C2/C6.\n    *   The position ortho to the activating t-butyl group (C2/C6) is also meta to the deactivating anilinium group. This makes it the most favorable site for electrophilic attack.\n    -   The product is **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. This is a well-established regiochemical outcome.\n*   Step (v) 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline + NaNO2/HCl → Diazotization of the -NH2 group to -N2+. Correct.\n*   Step (vi) Diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → Replacement of the -N2+ group with an -OH group, forming a phenol. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**. Correct.\n*   Step (vii) 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr → Williamson Ether Synthesis. The phenoxide is formed with NaOH and then alkylated with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. Product: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. Correct.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence of reactions in Option B is a chemically sound and logical pathway that produces **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** in high yield.\n\nNow, let's compare this to the target molecule: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   Product from Path B: `1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`\n*   Target Molecule: `1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene` (re-written by IUPAC rules)\n\nThese are isomers; they are not the same molecule. No provided reaction sequence correctly produces the target molecule in high yield. This indicates a probable error in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the options provided.\n\nHowever, when faced with such a flawed question, the task is to identify the *best* or *most plausible* synthetic route among the choices. Option B describes a complete, high-yield, and chemically correct synthesis of a specific isomer. The other options are flawed by chemically impossible steps or incorrect strategic choices. Therefore, Option B is the most likely intended answer, assuming a typo in the target's name.\n\n<<<B>>>"
