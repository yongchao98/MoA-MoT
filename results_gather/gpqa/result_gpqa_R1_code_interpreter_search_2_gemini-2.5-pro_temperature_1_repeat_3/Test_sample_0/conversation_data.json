    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n*   **Lifetime and Energy Uncertainty:** The lifetime (τ) of an unstable quantum state can be considered as the uncertainty in time (Δt). Therefore, the energy of that state is not perfectly defined but has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" (ΔE), often denoted as Γ. This relationship is approximately:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n*   **Condition for Resolution:** To clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, E1 and E2, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (widths). This ensures that the energy distributions of the two states do not overlap too much.\n    |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\n*   **Calculate Individual Energy Uncertainties:**\n    *   We are given the lifetimes: τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s and τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s.\n    *   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV·s for convenience: ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n    *   For the first state (E1):\n        ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   For the second state (E2):\n        ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Difference:**\n    The minimum energy separation required for resolution is the sum of the individual widths:\n    ΔE_required > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n    ΔE_required > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    ΔE_required > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    ΔE_required > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **Compare with Options:**\n    We need to find the option that represents an energy difference greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (<< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    B) 10⁻⁴ eV   (>> 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    C) 10⁻⁹ eV   (<< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    D) 10⁻⁸ eV   (< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n    Only option B is significantly larger than the minimum required energy difference.\n\n**2. Python Code for Calculation:**\nTo confirm the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# Constants\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\n# The minimum energy difference for resolution is the sum of the widths\nmin_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Minimum required energy difference for resolution: {min_energy_difference:.4e} eV\")\n\n# Check the options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-11,\n    \"B\": 1e-4,\n    \"C\": 1e-9,\n    \"D\": 1e-8\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if value > min_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference (resolvable).\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is not a possible energy difference (not resolvable).\")\n```\nEnergy width of state 1 (ΔE1): 6.5820e-07 eV\nEnergy width of state 2 (ΔE2): 6.5820e-08 eV\nMinimum required energy difference for resolution: 7.2402e-07 eV\n\nComparing with options:\nOption A (1.0e-11 eV) is not a possible energy difference (not resolvable).\nOption B (1.0e-04 eV) is a possible energy difference (resolvable).\nOption C (1.0e-09 eV) is not a possible energy difference (not resolvable).\nOption D (1.0e-08 eV) is not a possible energy difference (not resolvable).\n\nThe calculation confirms that an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is sufficient to resolve the two levels, while the other options are too small.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem requires us to apply the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Understand the Principle:**\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt or τ) are related by:\nΔE * τ ≥ ħ/2\nFor practical calculations, we often use the approximation:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\nHere, ΔE represents the natural linewidth or the inherent \"fuzziness\" of the energy level. A shorter lifetime (τ) means a larger energy uncertainty (ΔE).\n\n**2. Condition for Resolution:**\nTo clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, E1 and E2, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (ΔE1 and ΔE2). This ensures that their energy distributions do not significantly overlap.\nRequired condition: |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Uncertainties:**\nWe need the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ, in units of eV·s:\nħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    Energy uncertainty ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n    Energy uncertainty ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**4. Determine the Minimum Energy Difference for Resolution:**\nThe minimum required energy difference is the sum of the individual uncertainties:\n|E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n|E1 - E2| > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n|E1 - E2| > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n|E1 - E2| > 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**5. Compare with the Given Options:**\nWe need to find the option that is greater than 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (<< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV   (>> 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV   (<< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV   (< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, is large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<B>>>"
