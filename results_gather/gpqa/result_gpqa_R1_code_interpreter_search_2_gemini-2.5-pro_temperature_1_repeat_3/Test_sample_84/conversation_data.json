    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:** We need to compute the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out in the ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a_1}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a_2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This means the problem is reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n5.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** The radial velocity (RV) method provides the amplitude of the star's velocity wobble, K. For a planet in a circular orbit, this amplitude is given by:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_* a}} \\sqrt{G}$ (assuming planet mass $M_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_*$).\n    Here, $i$ is the orbital inclination. Since the planets were also detected by the transit method, their orbits must be edge-on from our perspective, meaning the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula for K to solve for `a`:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_* a}$\n    $a = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_*}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):** Now we can find the ratio we need for the temperature calculation:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{(M_{p,2}^2 G) / (K_2^2 M_*)}{(M_{p,1}^2 G) / (K_1^2 M_*)}$\n    The gravitational constant G and the star's mass $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p,1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n8.  **Relate Doppler Shift to RV Amplitude (K):** The observed Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is related to the radial velocity amplitude (K) by the formula:\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\n    where c is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength.\n    The ratio of the RV amplitudes is therefore equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n9.  **Substitute and Calculate:** Now we can substitute the ratio of Doppler shifts back into the equation for the ratio of semi-major axes:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n    And finally, substitute this into the temperature ratio formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}} \\times \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n10. **Plug in the Numerical Values:**\n    *   $M_{p,1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n    *   $M_{p,2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n11. **Final Calculation:** Perform the final division to get the decimal value.\n```python\n# Given values\n# Mass of Planet 1 in Earth masses\nM_p1 = 7\n# Mass of Planet 2 in Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5\n# Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is given by:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\nratio_Teq = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\n\nprint(ratio_Teq)\n```\n<<<\n0.5357142857142857\n\n>>>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357, which rounds to 0.53.

    "The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature, $A$ is the planet's albedo, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}}$.\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). The formula simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$), we use the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV amplitude, K, for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*^{2/3}}$\nwhere $P$ is the orbital period, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_*$ is the star's mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination. Since the planets are detected by the transit method, we can assume the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n\nUsing Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_* + M_p)}a^3 \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM_*}a^3$ for $M_p \\ll M_*$), we can substitute the period $P$ to express K in terms of the semi-major axis $a$:\n$K = \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_* a}} \\sqrt{G}$\n\nFrom this, we can solve for the semi-major axis $a$:\n$a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p,2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p,1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2}{M_{p,1}^2} \\times \\frac{K_1^2}{K_2^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe RV amplitude K is related to the observed Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ by the non-relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n$K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe ratio of the RV amplitudes is therefore:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nSubstitute this back into the equation for the ratio of semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\nFinally, we can find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}} \\times \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p,1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p,2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
