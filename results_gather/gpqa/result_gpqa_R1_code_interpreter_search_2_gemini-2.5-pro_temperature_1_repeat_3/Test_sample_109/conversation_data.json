    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which stars can be detected by both spectrographs.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Observability Criteria\n\nA star must satisfy two conditions to be observed by both the ESPRESSO (at Paranal Observatory) and HIRES (at Keck Observatory).\n\n**1. Positional Criterion (Visibility):**\nThe star must be visible from both observatory locations. A star is visible from a given latitude if it rises above the horizon. For an observatory at latitude `φ`, stars with declination `δ` are visible if `φ - 90° < δ < φ + 90°`.\n\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory:** Located at a latitude (φ_Keck) of approximately +19.8° N.\n    *   The declination range for visibility is `19.8° - 90° < δ < 19.8° + 90°`, which simplifies to `-70.2° < δ < 109.8°`. Since declination is capped at ±90°, the range is `-70.2° < δ ≤ +90°`.\n*   **Paranal Observatory:** Located at a latitude (φ_Paranal) of approximately -24.6° S.\n    *   The declination range for visibility is `-24.6° - 90° < δ < -24.6° + 90°`, which simplifies to `-114.6° < δ < +65.4°`. Since declination is capped at ±90°, the range is `-90° ≤ δ < +65.4°`.\n\nFor a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be in the intersection of these two ranges.\n*   Intersection of (`-70.2°, +90°`] and [`-90°, +65.4°`) is **`-70.2° < δ < +65.4°`**.\n\n**2. Magnitude Criterion (Brightness):**\nThe star must be bright enough for both instruments.\n*   ESPRESSO limit: Apparent V magnitude (m_V) < 17.\n*   HIRES limit: Apparent V magnitude (m_V) < 16.\n\nFor a star to be detected by **both**, it must satisfy the stricter limit, which is **`m_V < 16`**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Apparent Magnitude (m_V) when necessary\n\nThe apparent magnitude `m_V` is related to the absolute magnitude `M_V`, distance `d` (in parsecs), and interstellar absorption `A_V` by the distance modulus equation:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\n\nThe absorption `A_V` is calculated from the color excess `E(B-V)` using the given relation:\n`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Star\n\nI will now evaluate each star against the two criteria (`-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°` and `m_V < 16`).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_stars():\n    # Observability criteria\n    dec_min = -70.2  # Keck's southern limit\n    dec_max = 65.4   # Paranal's northern limit\n    mag_limit = 16.0 # Stricter limit from HIRES\n\n    print(\"Observability Criteria:\")\n    print(f\"Declination (DEC) must be between {dec_min:.1f} and {dec_max:.1f} degrees.\")\n    print(f\"Apparent V Magnitude (m_V) must be brighter than {mag_limit:.1f}.\\n\")\n\n    # Star 1\n    dec1 = -75.0\n    Mv1 = 15.5\n    d1 = 10.0\n    Av1 = 0.0\n    mv1 = Mv1 + 5 * math.log10(d1) - 5 + Av1\n    vis1 = dec_min < dec1 < dec_max\n    bright1 = mv1 < mag_limit\n    print(\"--- Star 1 ---\")\n    print(f\"DEC = {dec1} deg.
