    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** Heating to 240°C with excess KOH.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   1H NMR: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H).\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone in a six-membered or larger ring, or an acyclic ketone. A conjugated ketone would typically absorb at a lower frequency (e.g., 1680 cm⁻¹), so the C=O group is likely not conjugated with a C=C bond.\n    *   The 1H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is in the vinylic region. A peak in this region integrating to 2H strongly suggests an exocyclic methylene group (=CH2).\n    *   The reaction involves starting with a C10 compound and the reagents (KOH) provide oxygen. The NMR shows 14 protons in total. This is consistent with a molecular formula of C10H14O. The degrees of unsaturation for C10H14O is (2*10 + 2 - 14) / 2 = 4. Adamantane itself has 3 rings (3 DU). A C=O bond adds 1 DU, for a total of 4. Therefore, a saturated tricyclic ketone structure (an \"adamantanone\") would fit this formula.\n    *   However, a saturated structure cannot explain the 4.79 ppm NMR signal. This signal requires a C=C bond. A structure with 3 rings, a C=O, and a C=C would have 5 DU, which contradicts the formula.\n    *   Therefore, the adamantane cage must have rearranged into a structure with fewer rings. A bicyclic structure (2 rings) with a C=O (1 DU) and a C=C (1 DU) would have a total of 4 DU, matching the formula C10H14O.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the subsequent reactions**\n\n*   **Product 1 → Product 2:** The reagent is aluminum isopropoxide, which is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols and does not affect isolated C=C bonds. So, Product 2 is an alcohol that still contains the C=C bond.\n    *   P1 (ketone, C=C) → P2 (alcohol, C=C)\n\n*   **Product 2 → Product 3:** The reagents are ozone (O3) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves C=C double bonds and converts them into carbonyl groups.\n    *   P2 (alcohol, C=C) → P3 (alcohol, carbonyls)\n    *   This confirms that Product 1 and Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond.\n\n**Step 3: Propose a plausible structure and follow the reaction sequence**\n\nThe combination of data for Product 1 (bicyclic, non-conjugated ketone, exocyclic =CH2, high symmetry suggested by the simple NMR) points towards a specific rearranged structure. While the mechanism is complex, a very plausible structure for **Product 1** is **3-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one**.\n\n*   Let's check this structure:\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14O. (Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane is C9H16. Making a ketone removes 2H, making an exocyclic methylene from a CH2 adds a C and removes 2H. C9H16 -> C9H14O -> C10H14O). Correct.\n    *   **Functionality:** It has a ketone at C7 and an exocyclic methylene (=CH2) at C3. They are not conjugated. This matches the IR data.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C3, the C9 bridge, and C7. This high symmetry can explain the simple 3-signal 1H NMR spectrum. The =CH2 protons are at 4.79 ppm, and the other 12 cage protons fall into two groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a very likely structure for Product 1.\n\nNow, let's trace the reactions with this structure:\n\n1.  **Product 2:** MPV reduction of the ketone at C7 yields the corresponding alcohol.\n    *   **Product 2 = 3-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-ol**.\n\n2.  **Product 3:** Ozonolysis of the double bond at C3 cleaves the C=CH2 group. The carbon of the ring (C3) becomes a ketone (C=O), and the CH2 group is lost as formaldehyde (HCHO).\n    *   **Product 3 = 7-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 3**\n\nWe need to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in **7-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one** (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton).\n\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** It's a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane frame with a ketone at C3 and a hydroxyl group at C7. The molecule retains the plane of symmetry passing through C3, C9, and C7.\n*   **Identifying the most deshielded proton:**\n    *   Protons alpha to the ketone (at C2 and C4) have shifts around 2.2-2.7 ppm.\n    *   The carbinol proton (the H attached to C7, which also bears the -OH group) typically has a chemical shift in the range of 3.5-4.5 ppm.\n    *   Other protons (bridgehead, etc.) will be further upfield.\n    *   Therefore, the **proton at C7 (H7)** is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n\n*   **Determining the coupling pattern of H7:**\n    *   We need to look at the protons on the adjacent carbons. C7 is bonded to C6 and C8.\n    *   Both C6 and C8 are methylene (-CH2-) groups. So, H7 is coupled to a total of four protons.\n    *   Due to the plane of symmetry, the C6 and C8 positions are equivalent.\n    *   On each of these carbons, the two protons (axial-like and equatorial-like) are diastereotopic and will have different coupling constants to H7. Let's call them H_a and H_b.\n    *   So, H7 is coupled to two equivalent protons (H6_a and H8_a) with a coupling constant J_a. This would produce a triplet.\n    *   H7 is also coupled to two other equivalent protons (H6_b and H8_b) with a coupling constant J_b. This would split each line of the first triplet into another triplet.\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**. This assumes that J_a and J_b are different enough to be resolved, which is typical for such rigid systems.\n\nFinal Answer options check:\nA) pentet: This would happen if all four neighboring protons had the same coupling constant (J_a ≈ J_b).\nB) doublet of triplets: This would require coupling to one proton and a set of two equivalent protons.\nC) triplet: This would require coupling to only one set of two equivalent protons.\nD) triplet of triplets: This is the precise pattern for coupling to two different sets of two equivalent protons.\n\nThe most accurate description of the splitting pattern is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<D>>>"
