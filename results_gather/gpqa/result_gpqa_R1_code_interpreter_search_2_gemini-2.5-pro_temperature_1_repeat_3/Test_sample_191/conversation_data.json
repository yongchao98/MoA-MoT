    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the effect of the charge inside the cavity:**\n    The positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity of the conductor. Due to electrostatic induction, this charge will attract negative charges and repel positive charges within the conductive material.\n    *   A total charge of $-q$ will be induced on the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity). This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law. If we consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the electric field $\\vec{E}$ must be zero everywhere on this surface (as it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). For the electric field to be zero, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, the sum of the charge placed in the cavity ($+q$) and the charge induced on the inner surface ($q_{inner}$) must be zero.\n        $q + q_{inner} = 0 \\implies q_{inner} = -q$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the charge on the outer surface:**\n    The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). The induction process only separates the existing charges within the conductor. Since a charge of $-q$ has accumulated on the inner surface, a corresponding charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality. This charge $+q$ will reside on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   Total charge of the conductor = $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$\n    *   $-q + q_{outer} = 0 \\implies q_{outer} = +q$.\n\n3.  **Apply the principle of electrostatic shielding:**\n    A key property of a hollow conductor (like a Faraday cage) is that it shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it. The electric field at any point outside the cavity, produced by the combination of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface, is exactly zero.\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P outside the conductor is solely due to the charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Determine the electric field from the outer surface charge:**\n    The charge on the outer surface is $+q$. Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external charges in the vicinity, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical surface of radius $R$.\n    According to the shell theorem (which can be derived from Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n\n5.  **Calculate the electric field at point P:**\n    *   The effective charge producing the field at P is the charge on the outer surface, which is $+q$.\n    *   This charge acts as if it were a point charge located at the center of the spherical conductor.\n    *   The distance of point P from the center of the spherical conductor is given as $L$.\n    *   Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point P is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q_{outer}}{L^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given information:**\n    The problem provides several other parameters: the radius of the cavity ($r$), the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center ($s$), the distance of point P from the cavity's center ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$. Due to the electrostatic shielding effect of the conductor, the electric field outside the conductor is independent of the exact position and shape of the cavity and the position of the charge within it. Therefore, the parameters $r, s, l,$ and $\\theta$ are irrelevant to the final answer. They are included as distractors.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect. This ignores the shielding effect of the conductor.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct. This matches our derivation.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\n\nThe final answer is based on the fundamental principles of electrostatics for conductors.\n\n<<<B>>>"
