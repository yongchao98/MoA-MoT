    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:** The system of two electrons is in the coupled angular momentum state given by $|\\psi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   This state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator squared, $L^2$, with eigenvalue $l(l+1)\\hbar^2 = 2(2+1)\\hbar^2 = 6\\hbar^2$.\n    *   It is also an eigenstate of the z-component of the total angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the final state:** A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed. We want to find the probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_1\\hbar$. The desired outcome is $m_1\\hbar = -\\hbar$, which means $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_2\\hbar$. The desired outcome is $m_2\\hbar = -\\hbar$, which means $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   This measurement outcome corresponds to projecting the initial state onto the uncoupled state $|\\phi\\rangle = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the principles of quantum mechanics:** The probability of obtaining the outcome corresponding to state $|\\phi\\rangle$ when the system is in state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product (or projection) of the two states:\n    $P = |\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle|^2$.\n\n4.  **Use the properties of angular momentum addition:** The coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:\n    $|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1 m_2 m}^{l_1 l_2 l} |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$\n    A fundamental selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the magnetic quantum numbers sum up correctly:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n5.  **Check the selection rule for the given problem:**\n    *   The initial coupled state has a total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired final uncoupled state has individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check if the sum $m_1 + m_2$ equals $m$:\n        $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$\n    *   We see that $-2 \\neq -1$.\n\n6.  **Draw the conclusion:** Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $C_{(-1)(-1)(-1)}^{1 \\ 1 \\ 2}$ is zero. This means the state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$ has zero amplitude in the expansion of the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    The inner product is:\n    $\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle = \\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the probability:**\n    $P = |\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle|^2 = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n**Alternative Explanation (Conservation Argument):**\nThe initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. The state corresponding to the measurement outcome, $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$. Its eigenvalue is $(m_1 + m_2)\\hbar = (-1 + -1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\nSince the initial state and the final state are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) but with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar \\neq -2\\hbar$), they must be orthogonal. The projection of the initial state onto the final state is zero, and therefore the probability of this measurement outcome is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
