    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the given information from the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The two compounds in the mixture both have the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n*   The fact that all aliphatic signals are singlets immediately suggests that the alkyl groups are methyl groups, not ethyl, propyl, etc., as those would show splitting (quartets, triplets). This allows us to eliminate **1,4-diethylbenzene** from the options, as its spectrum would contain a quartet and a triplet.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the remaining candidate compounds:**\n\nWe need to determine the number of chemically distinct protons and their multiplicity for each tetramethylbenzene isomer based on molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups are in two different environments. The \"outer\" methyls (at C1 and C4) are equivalent to each other, and the \"inner\" methyls (at C2 and C3) are equivalent to each other. This results in two distinct signals.\n        *   One **singlet** for the C1 and C4 methyls, integrating to **6H**.\n        *   One **singlet** for the C2 and C3 methyls, integrating to **6H**.\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments and are therefore not equivalent. This will produce **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. This will produce **four separate singlets**, each integrating to **3H**.\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 aliphatic singlets (3H each).\n\n**3. Test the combinations given in the options against the experimental data.**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives:\n*   Aromatic: 2 singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   Aliphatic: 3 singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's evaluate the correct option, which is D.\n\n**Combination D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   Assuming these two singlets have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **two singlets**. Since both originate from 2 protons, their integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two different singlets (6H each).\n    *   In total, the mixture will show **three singlets**. The integration will be 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 mixture is the only one that directly and unequivocally explains the observed 1H NMR spectrum without requiring any assumptions of accidental signal overlap.\n\n<<<D>>>"
