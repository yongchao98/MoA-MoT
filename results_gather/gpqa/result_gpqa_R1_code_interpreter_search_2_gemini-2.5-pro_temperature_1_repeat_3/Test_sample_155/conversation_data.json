    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2CH2   H\n               \\ /\n                C=C\n               / \\\n              H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons in a backside attack, which is an *anti*-addition relative to the epoxide oxygen.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The sequence of *syn*-epoxidation followed by *anti*-ring-opening results in a net **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene. Two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** We apply the established stereochemical rule for additions to alkenes: **Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound**.\n    *   Let's verify this. The anti-addition of two -OH groups to (E)-oct-4-ene results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This molecule possesses an internal plane of symmetry (in its eclipsed conformation) or a center of inversion (in its staggered conformation), making it a meso compound. A meso compound is achiral, despite having chiral centers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single, achiral meso compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n               \\ /\n                C=C\n               / \\\n              H   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same, so the overall transformation is also an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** We apply the corresponding stereochemical rule: **Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture (a pair of enantiomers)**.\n    *   The anti-addition of two -OH groups to (Z)-oct-4-ene produces a 50:50 mixture of two products: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's define the stereochemical relationships between these compounds:\n*   **(4R,5R)-diol** and **(4S,5S)-diol** are **enantiomers**.\n*   **meso-diol** is a **diastereomer** of both (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe problem asks for the number of peaks observed on two different types of HPLC columns, assuming perfect resolution.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral chromatography separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will have different retention times, thus appearing as separate peaks.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   In our mixture:\n        *   The enantiomeric pair [(4R,5R)-diol + (4S,5S)-diol] will elute together as **one peak**.\n        *   The meso-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time, eluting as a **second peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral chromatography uses a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows for the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase, which have different energies and stabilities.\n    *   A chiral column can separate both enantiomers and diastereomers.\n    *   In our mixture, all three stereoisomers are chemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n        *   **(4R,5R)-diol** will elute as one peak.\n        *   **(4S,5S)-diol** will elute as a second, separate peak.\n        *   **meso-diol** (a diastereomer to the other two) will elute as a third, separate peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
