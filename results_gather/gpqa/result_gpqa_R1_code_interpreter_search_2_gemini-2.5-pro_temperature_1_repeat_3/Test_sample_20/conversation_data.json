    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Part A):**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers that can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two carbonyl (C=O) groups at opposite positions (1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups and each has two hydrogen atoms. The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows for keto-enol tautomerism. The molecule can tautomerize to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and therefore highly stable, so the equilibrium strongly favors the enol form. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exhibits tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B):**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups).\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n        Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it has a pair of enantiomers).\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ (the *trans* isomer). This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. It is a planar molecule with a plane of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. (It does, however, show geometric isomerism with its *cis* counterpart, dimethyl maleate).\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is benzoquinone.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
