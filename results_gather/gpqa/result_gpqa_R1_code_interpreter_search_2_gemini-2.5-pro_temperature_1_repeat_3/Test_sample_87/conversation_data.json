    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the experimental setup and observations.**\n    *   **Antigen delivery:** Rotavirus capsid proteins are delivered orally. This means the immune response will be initiated in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).\n    *   **Location of immune response:** Fluorescent Peyer's patches are observed. Peyer's patches are the primary inductive sites for intestinal immunity, a key component of GALT. This is where naive lymphocytes encounter antigens from the gut lumen and become activated.\n    *   **Cellular activity:** Proliferating cells are isolated from these Peyer's patches. Cell proliferation (clonal expansion) is a hallmark of an adaptive immune response, where lymphocytes that recognize the antigen are selected and multiply.\n    *   **Genetic finding:** The variable heavy chain (Vh) gene of these proliferating cells shows high variability. The Vh gene codes for the part of the antibody that binds to the antigen.\n\n*   **Step 2: Evaluate the provided options in the context of the findings.**\n    *   **A) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process changes the constant region of the antibody heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA). It determines the antibody's effector function but does *not* alter the variable region or increase its variability. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n    *   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM deliberately introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). The purpose of this is to generate variants of the original B cell receptor, some of which will have a higher affinity for the antigen. These high-affinity B cells are then positively selected to proliferate. This process directly leads to \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating B cell population. This perfectly matches the observation.\n    *   **C) V(D)J recombination:** This process occurs in developing B cells within the primary lymphoid organ (the bone marrow). It is responsible for creating the initial, vast repertoire of B cell receptors *before* the B cell ever encounters an antigen. While it generates diversity, it is not a process that happens in proliferating cells in a secondary lymphoid organ in response to an antigen. The high variability observed in the experiment is a result of a secondary diversification process occurring *after* antigen encounter.\n    *   **D) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system (though it can be activated by antibodies). It involves a cascade of proteins in the blood and has no direct role in altering the genetic sequence of B cell variable regions.\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclude based on the analysis.**\n    The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells within a Peyer's patch after antigen stimulation is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation. This process is essential for affinity maturation of the antibody response.\n\n<<<B>>>"
