    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure and symmetry of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃) is treated with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically, nitration.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an electron-donating group, which activates the aromatic ring and is an *ortho-, para-* director.\n*   **Product 1:** The nitration of toluene yields a mixture of *o*-nitrotoluene and *p*-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance, the *para* isomer is the major product. In multi-step synthesis problems, it is standard to assume the major product is carried to the next step.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 1:** Product 1 is **4-nitrotoluene**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (4-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a strong oxidizing agent used for the oxidation of benzylic C-H bonds.\n*   **Reaction:** The methyl group (-CH₃) of 4-nitrotoluene is oxidized to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The nitro group (-NO₂) is stable under these conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** The oxidation of 4-nitrotoluene yields **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (4-nitrobenzoic acid) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** We have a nitroaromatic compound, a base (NaOH), and an enolizable ketone (acetone).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:**\n    *   First, the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid reacts with NaOH to form sodium 4-nitrobenzoate.\n    *   NaOH also deprotonates acetone to form its enolate (⁻CH₂C(=O)CH₃).\n    *   The acetone enolate can act as a reducing agent, especially towards nitro groups, under basic conditions. This reaction is a bimolecular reduction where two molecules of the nitro compound are coupled together. The nitro groups are reduced, and the acetone is oxidized.\n    *   The reduction of nitroarenes under mild basic conditions often yields an azoxy compound (R-N(O)=N-R). Stronger reduction can lead to an azo compound (R-N=N-R).\n    *   Let's consider both possibilities for Product 3:\n        1.  **trans-4,4'-azoxybenzenedicarboxylic acid:** Formed from the coupling of two molecules of 4-nitrobenzoic acid.\n        2.  **trans-4,4'-azobenzenedicarboxylic acid:** Formed by further reduction of the azoxy compound.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\nNow, we must determine the point group for the plausible structures and see which one matches the given options.\n\n*   **Case A: Product 3 is trans-4,4'-azoxybenzenedicarboxylic acid**\n    *   Structure: HOOC-C₆H₄-N=N(O)-C₆H₄-COOH.\n    *   The presence of the oxygen atom on only one of the two nitrogen atoms breaks the symmetry of the molecule. Due to steric hindrance between the oxygen atom and the adjacent phenyl ring, the molecule is non-planar. A non-planar, asymmetric molecule like this has only the identity element (E) and belongs to the **C₁** point group.\n    *   If we make an idealization and assume the molecule is perfectly planar, it would possess a single plane of symmetry (the molecular plane, σh). The point group would be **Cₛ**. This matches option (B). However, this relies on an incorrect structural assumption.\n\n*   **Case B: Product 3 is trans-4,4'-azobenzenedicarboxylic acid**\n    *   Structure: HOOC-C₆H₄-N=N-C₆H₄-COOH.\n    *   This molecule is known to be planar. The *trans* configuration around the N=N double bond and the *para* substitution pattern give it a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   Let's identify its symmetry elements:\n        *   **E**: The identity element.\n        *   **C₂ axis**: A two-fold rotational axis that lies in the molecular plane and passes through the midpoint of the N=N bond, perpendicular to it.\n        *   **i (center of inversion)**: Located at the midpoint of the N=N bond.\n        *   **σh (plane of symmetry)**: The plane containing the entire molecule.\n    *   A molecule with the symmetry elements {E, C₂, i, σh} belongs to the **C₂h** point group. This matches option (C).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the possibilities, the formation of the azo compound (trans-4,4'-azobenzenedicarboxylic acid) leads to a product with a C₂h point group, which is one of the options. The formation of the azoxy compound leads to a product that is rigorously C₁ (not an option) or Cₛ if idealized as planar (option B). Given that C₂h corresponds to a stable, well-defined planar structure without requiring idealizations, and is a plausible product of the reaction sequence, it is the most likely intended answer. The reaction is assumed to proceed to the more fully reduced and highly symmetrical azo compound.\n\nThe final product, 3, is trans-4,4'-azobenzenedicarboxylic acid, which has a C₂h molecular symmetry group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
