    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   \"No vinyl-hydrogens\" indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules, which is consistent with this information.\n    *   The crucial pieces of information are the splitting patterns:\n        *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This means the proton giving this signal is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet, n=1), two equivalent protons (giving the triplet, n=2), and three equivalent protons (giving the quartet, n=3).\n        *   A different signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This means the proton giving this signal is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet, n=1), two equivalent protons (giving one triplet, n=2), and another set of two equivalent protons (giving the other triplet, n=2).\n    *   **Goal:** We need to find the molecule among the options that has two different protons whose environments match these splitting patterns.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Structure:**\n\n    Let's determine the structure from each condensed formula and analyze the expected splitting patterns for the key protons (the CH groups, which are most likely to show such complex splitting).\n\n    *   **A) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        ```\n              CH3(g) CH3(f)\n              |      |\n        COOH-CH2(d)-CH(c)-CH(b)-CH3(a)\n        ```\n        *   **H(c)** is bonded to C3. Neighbors: H(d) (2H), H(b) (1H), H(f) (3H). This gives a **triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq)**, which is equivalent to a **dtq**. This matches one signal.\n        *   **H(b)** is bonded to C4. Neighbors: H(c) (1H), H(g) (3H), H(a) (3H). This gives a **doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq)**.\n        *   This molecule has a `dtq` signal but **not** a `dtt` signal.\n\n    *   **B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n        ```\n                   CH2(g)CH3(h)   CH2(a)CH3(b)\n                   |              |\n        COOH(i) - CH(d) - CH(c) - CH2(e) - CH3(f)\n        ```\n        *   **H(c)** is bonded to C3. Neighbors: H(d) (1H), H(e) (2H), H(a) (2H). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one signal.\n        *   **H(d)** is bonded to C2. Neighbors: H(c) (1H), H(g) (2H). This gives a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n        *   This molecule has a `dtt` signal but **not** a `dtq` signal.\n\n    *   **D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        ```\n                   CH3(f) CH3(g)\n                   |      |\n        COOH(e) - CH(d)- CH(c)- CH2(b) - CH3(a)\n        ```\n        *   **H(c)** is bonded to C3. Neighbors: H(d) (1H), H(b) (2H), H(g) (3H). This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one signal.\n        *   **H(d)** is bonded to C2. Neighbors: H(c) (1H), H(f) (3H). This gives a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   This molecule has a `dtq` signal but **not** a `dtt` signal.\n\n    *   **C) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n        The condensed formula is best interpreted by finding the longest carbon chain that includes the COOH group. This gives a hexanoic acid backbone with an ethyl group at C3 and a methyl group at C4.\n        ```\n                CH2(h)CH3(i) [ethyl on C3]\n                |\n        COOH(g)-CH2(f)-CH(e)-CH(d)-CH2(b)-CH3(a)\n                             |\n                             CH3(c) [methyl on C4]\n        ```\n        Let's analyze the two chiral center protons, H(e) and H(d).\n        *   **H(e)** is bonded to C3. Its neighbors are:\n            *   The two protons on C2, H(f) (2H) → gives a **triplet**.\n            *   The single proton on C4, H(d) (1H) → gives a **doublet**.\n            *   The two protons on the ethyl group's CH2, H(h) (2H) → gives a **triplet**.\n            *   The combined splitting for H(e) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n        *   **H(d)** is bonded to C4. Its neighbors are:\n            *   The single proton on C3, H(e) (1H) → gives a **doublet**.\n            *   The two protons on C5, H(b) (2H) → gives a **triplet**.\n            *   The three protons of the methyl group, H(c) (3H) → gives a **quartet**.\n            *   The combined splitting for H(d) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other required signal.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Molecule C is the only candidate that exhibits both a `dtt` signal (from the proton at C3) and a `dtq` signal (from the proton at C4). Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
