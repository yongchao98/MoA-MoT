    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the initial conditions and the dilution process.**\n*   We start with 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   First, we calculate the initial moles of acetic acid:\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.020 L = 0.001 mol of CH₃COOH.\n*   This solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) of water.\n*   The new total volume of the acetic acid solution is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L).\n*   The concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution is:\n    *   New Concentration = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M.\n*   This diluted solution (40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M CH₃COOH) is what will be titrated with 0.1 M NaOH.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   The titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O.\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains.\n*   At this point, the solution is a buffer containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   The ratio of the concentration of the conjugate base to the acid is [CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - log(3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253\n*   So, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid (0.001 mol).\n*   Calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:\n    *   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   At this point, the solution contains 0.001 mol of the conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), dissolved in 0.050 L of water.\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻):\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, producing OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion, which can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid and the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C):\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   Now, we can find the concentration of OH⁻ produced. Let [OH⁻] = x. From the hydrolysis reaction, [CH₃COOH] will also be x.\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can assume that x is negligible compared to 0.02 M. So, (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Calculate the pOH:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n*   Finally, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n*   So, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.

    "The user wants me to solve a titration problem and identify the correct option.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial state and dilution.**\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (HA): V_initial = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid: C_initial = 0.05 M\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid: n_HA = C_initial * V_initial = 0.05 mol/L * 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol\n*   The acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   Volume of diluted acid: V_diluted = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n*   Concentration of diluted acid: C_diluted = n_HA / V_diluted = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   The titration reaction is CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O.\n*   25% titration means that 25% of the initial moles of CH₃COOH have reacted with NaOH to form CH₃COO⁻ (the conjugate base).\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH reacted = 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed = 0.00025 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = 0.75 * 0.001 mol = 0.00075 mol\n*   At this point, the solution is a buffer. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) and [HA] is the concentration of the acid (acetic acid).\n*   The ratio of concentrations is the same as the ratio of moles: [A⁻]/[HA] = 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.\n*   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.7329 - 0.4771 = 4.2558\n*   The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been neutralized by NaOH.\n*   The moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of acid: n_NaOH = 0.001 mol.\n*   The solution now contains 0.001 mol of the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which completely dissociates into Na⁺ and CH₃COO⁻.\n*   The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water:\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need to find the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point.\n    *   Volume of NaOH added = n_NaOH / C_NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total volume = V_diluted_acid + V_NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n*   Now, calculate the concentration of the acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻]:\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion. We use the relationship Kw = Ka * Kb, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   Set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis of acetate:\n|             | CH₃COO⁻ | CH₃COOH | OH⁻   |\n|-------------|---------|----------|-------|\n| Initial (I) | 0.02 M  | 0        | 0     |\n| Change (C)  | -x      | +x       | +x    |\n| Equil. (E)  | 0.02-x  | x        | x     |\n*   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x << 0.02, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Now, calculate the pOH:\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n*   Finally, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the results with the options.**\n*   Calculated pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26\n*   Calculated pH at equivalence point ≈ 8.52\n*   These values match option D.\n\nThe python code provided previously confirmed these calculations.\n\nFinal check of the calculations:\n*   25% point: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = 4.73 + log(0.25/0.75) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. Looks correct.\n*   Equivalence point: [A-] = 0.001 mol / (0.040 L + 0.010 L) = 0.02 M. Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.4e-10. [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-]) = sqrt(5.4e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.08e-11) = 3.29e-6. pOH = -log(3.29e-6) = 5.48. pH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52. Looks correct.\n\nThe calculations are sound and have been verified.
