    "This is a particle decay problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Identify the initial and final states:**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A positive pion (π⁺) is at rest.\n    *   Initial energy (E_initial) = Rest mass energy of the pion = m_πc²\n    *   Initial momentum (p_initial) = 0\n*   **Final State:** A positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν) are produced.\n    *   Final energy (E_final) = E_μ + E_ν\n    *   Final momentum (p_final) = p_μ + p_ν\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** E_initial = E_final\n    *   m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n    *   The total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy (E = mc² + KE).\n    *   m_πc² = (m_μc² + KE_μ) + E_ν\n    *   We assume the neutrino (ν) is massless (a standard approximation in such problems). For a massless particle, its energy is purely kinetic, so E_ν = KE_ν.\n    *   Therefore, the energy conservation equation is:\n        **m_πc² = m_μc² + KE_μ + KE_ν** (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** p_initial = p_final\n    *   0 = p_μ + p_ν\n    *   This implies that the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p (Equation 2)\n\n**3. Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n\nThe energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)².\n\n*   **For the muon (μ⁺):**\n    *   E_μ² = (p_μc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   (m_μc² + KE_μ)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)² (Equation 3)\n\n*   **For the massless neutrino (ν):**\n    *   E_ν² = (p_νc)² + (0)²\n    *   KE_ν² = (pc)²  =>  **KE_ν = pc** (Equation 4)\n\n**4. Solve for the Kinetic Energies:**\n\n1.  Substitute `(pc)²` from Equation 4 into Equation 3:\n    (m_μc² + KE_μ)² = KE_ν² + (m_μc²)²\n\n2.  From Equation 1, rearrange to find KE_ν:\n    KE_ν = m_πc² - m_μc² - KE_μ\n\n3.  Substitute this expression for KE_ν into the equation from step 1:\n    (m_μc² + KE_μ)² = (m_πc² - m_μc² - KE_μ)² + (m_μc²)²\n\n4.  Expand both sides:\n    (m_μc²)² + 2(m_μc²)KE_μ + KE_μ² = (m_πc² - m_μc²)² - 2(m_πc² - m_μc²)KE_μ + KE_μ² + (m_μc²)²\n\n5.  Simplify by canceling the (m_μc²)² and KE_μ² terms from both sides:\n    2(m_μc²)KE_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²)² - 2(m_πc² - m_μc²)KE_μ\n\n6.  Group the KE_μ terms together and solve for KE_μ:\n    2(m_μc²)KE_μ + 2(m_πc² - m_μc²)KE_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²)²\n    (2m_μc² + 2m_πc² - 2m_μc²)KE_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²)²\n    (2m_πc²)KE_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²)²\n    **KE_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²)² / (2 * m_πc²)**\n\nNow, we can calculate the numerical values using the provided masses.\n\n```python\n# Given rest masses in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) using the derived formula\nke_mu = (m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2)**2 / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) using energy conservation\n# KE_nu = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2 - KE_mu\nke_nu = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2 - ke_mu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places to match the options\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+) = {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu) = {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nKE of muon (mu+) = 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu) = 29.78 MeV\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (μ⁺) and 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino (ν).\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν). We need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n**1. Principles of Conservation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. Since the pion is stationary, its initial energy is just its rest mass energy.\n    *   E_initial = m_πc²\n    *   E_final = E_μ + E_ν = (m_μc² + KE_μ) + KE_ν  (Assuming the neutrino is massless, its energy is purely kinetic)\n    *   Therefore:  **m_πc² = m_μc² + KE_μ + KE_ν**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after. Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero.\n    *   p_initial = 0\n    *   p_final = p_μ + p_ν\n    *   Therefore: 0 = p_μ + p_ν, which implies **|p_μ| = |p_ν| = p**. The muon and neutrino move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude.\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m₀) is given by: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n\n*   **For the muon (μ⁺):**\n    *   E_μ² = (p_μc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   (m_μc² + KE_μ)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\n*   **For the neutrino (ν) (massless):**\n    *   E_ν² = (p_νc)² + (0)²\n    *   KE_ν² = (pc)²  =>  **KE_ν = pc**\n\n**3. Solving for Kinetic Energies**\n\n1.  From the energy conservation equation, we can express the total kinetic energy release (Q-value):\n    *   Q = KE_μ + KE_ν = m_πc² - m_μc²\n    *   Q = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n\n2.  We can express the kinetic energy of the neutrino in terms of momentum: KE_ν = pc.\n\n3.  We can also find an expression for pc from the muon's energy-momentum relation:\n    *   (m_μc² + KE_μ)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   (pc)² = (m_μc² + KE_μ)² - (m_μc²)²\n    *   (pc)² = (m_μc²)² + 2(m_μc²)KE_μ + KE_μ² - (m_μc²)²\n    *   (pc)² = 2(m_μc²)KE_μ + KE_μ²\n\n4.  Now we set the two expressions for (pc)² equal to each other (since KE_ν = pc):\n    *   KE_ν² = 2(m_μc²)KE_μ + KE_μ²\n\n5.  Substitute KE_ν = Q - KE_μ = 33.9 - KE_μ into the equation:\n    *   (33.9 - KE_μ)² = 2(105.7)KE_μ + KE_μ²\n    *   1149.21 - 67.8KE_μ + KE_μ² = 211.4KE_μ + KE_μ²\n\n6.  Simplify by canceling KE_μ² from both sides and solving for KE_μ:\n    *   1149.21 = 211.4KE_μ + 67.8KE_μ\n    *   1149.21 = 279.2KE_μ\n    *   KE_μ = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ 4.116 MeV\n\n7.  Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino:\n    *   KE_ν = Q - KE_μ\n    *   KE_ν = 33.9 MeV - 4.116 MeV ≈ 29.784 MeV\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The kinetic energy of the muon (μ⁺) is approximately **4.12 MeV**.\n*   The kinetic energy of the neutrino (ν) is approximately **29.8 MeV**.\n\nThese values correspond to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
