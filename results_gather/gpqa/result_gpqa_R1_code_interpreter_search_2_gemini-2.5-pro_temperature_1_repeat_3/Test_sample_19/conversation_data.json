    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\n1.  **Analyze the core concept:** The impulse approximation simplifies a complex many-body interaction (e.g., a particle scattering off a nucleus) into a more manageable one. The central idea is that the interaction is very rapid and localized, so it can be treated as an interaction with a single, quasi-free nucleon, while the rest of the nucleus acts as a spectator. The name \"impulse\" comes from the idea that a large momentum is transferred in a very short time (a large force, or impulse, is applied).\n\n2.  **Evaluate each statement:**\n\n    *   **Statement 1: \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"** This is a foundational assumption. If the interaction could involve multiple nucleons at once (through what are called meson-exchange currents or two-body currents), the entire premise of isolating a single nucleon would fail. Therefore, the model must assume the interaction happens with one nucleon at a time. This is a necessary condition.\n\n    *   **Statement 2: \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"** This addresses the \"before\" and \"after\" of the main interaction. If the incoming probe particle scattered off other nucleons on its way in, or if the outgoing particles (including the struck nucleon) scattered off the remaining nucleons on their way out (a process called \"final state interactions\"), the kinematics would be distorted. The final state would no longer look like a clean \"knock-out\" event from a single nucleon. To treat the interaction as a simple one-body process, we must assume the rest of the nucleus is \"transparent\" to the particles involved. This is a necessary condition. This is often relaxed in more sophisticated models (like the Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation, DWIA), but it is a key part of the basic impulse approximation.\n\n    *   **Statement 3: \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"** This statement describes the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation is concerned with the nucleon's behavior *within the nucleus* and its interaction with an external probe. It is not fundamentally concerned with the nucleon's substructure. One can use the impulse approximation in conjunction with either a relativistic or non-relativistic model for the nucleon's internal quark dynamics. Therefore, this is not a required assumption for the impulse approximation itself.\n\n    *   **Statement 4: \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"** This is the heart of the \"free nucleon\" idea. A nucleon in a nucleus is bound by the strong force, meaning it has a binding energy and sits in a nuclear potential. The impulse approximation assumes the interaction is so sudden that during the brief moment of interaction, these binding forces are negligible compared to the forces of the interaction itself. The nucleon is thus treated as being \"on-shell\" (having the mass of a free particle) and not subject to the nuclear potential during the scattering event. This is a necessary condition.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The impulse approximation is defined by the assumptions that the interaction is with a single nucleon (1), the rest of the nucleus does not interfere with the probe or the ejecta (2), and the binding forces on the target nucleon can be ignored during the interaction (4).\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
