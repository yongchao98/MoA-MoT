    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism.\n\n**Fundamental Concept: Optical Isomerism**\n\nFor a compound to exhibit optical isomerism, it must be **chiral**. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features that lead to chirality are:\n1.  **Chiral Center (Stereocenter):** A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Axial Chirality (Atropisomerism):** Restricted rotation around a single bond, often seen in substituted biphenyl compounds.\n3.  **Planar Chirality:** Chirality arising from a plane in the molecule.\n\nLet's analyze each compound based on these principles.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Each Compound**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The core structure consists of two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   At positions 2 and 2' (ortho to the connecting bond): `-COOCH3` (dimethyl carboxylate) groups.\n    *   At positions 6 and 6' (the other ortho positions): `-NO2` (nitro) groups.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   Normally, there is free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n    *   However, in this molecule, all four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are occupied by bulky groups (`-COOCH3` and `-NO2`).\n    *   These bulky groups clash with each other, severely restricting the rotation around the central C-C bond. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**.\n    *   Because rotation is locked, the two phenyl rings cannot become coplanar. The molecule exists in a twisted conformation. This twisted conformation and its mirror image are non-superimposable.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is **chiral** due to axial chirality. It will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** Also known as methyl lactate. The chemical formula is `CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3`.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the `-OH` group).\n    *   This carbon is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  `-H` (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  `-OH` (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  `-CH3` (a methyl group)\n        4.  `-COOCH3` (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center**.\n    *   The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule **chiral**. It will exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). It will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** A ketone where the carbonyl carbon is bonded to two phenyl rings. The formula is `(C6H5)2CO`.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The central carbon is `sp2` hybridized and is only bonded to three atoms (one oxygen and two carbons).\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, a plane of symmetry can be drawn through the `C=O` bond, bisecting the molecule.\n    *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry is **achiral** because it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is `CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3`, where the two `-COOCH3` groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   It has a center of inversion (a point in the center of the `C=C` bond through which any atom can be reflected to an identical atom on the opposite side).\n    *   A molecule with a center of inversion is **achiral**.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate will not exhibit optical isomerism. (Note: It does exhibit geometric isomerism with its *cis* counterpart, dimethyl maleate).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Compound 1:** Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   **Compound 2:** Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   **Compound 3:** Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   **Compound 4:** Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nThe compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
