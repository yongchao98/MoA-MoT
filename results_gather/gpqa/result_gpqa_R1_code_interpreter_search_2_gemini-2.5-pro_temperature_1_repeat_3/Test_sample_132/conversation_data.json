    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their roles.**\n    *   The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O.\n    *   KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate ion).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates into 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate ion), and 2H2O.\n    *   H2PO4- is a weak acid, and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base. Together, they form a buffer solution.\n    *   The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- (from KH2PO4) = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Initial concentration of H2PO4- = Moles / Volume = (1.00 / 136.09) mol / 0.200 L.\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4●2H2O) = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Initial concentration of HPO4^2- = Moles / Volume = (1.00 / 177.99) mol / 0.200 L.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer.**\n    *   The pH of this buffer is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4), for which the acid dissociation constant is Ka2.\n    *   Equilibrium reaction: H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻\n    *   Ka2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this formula to solve for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]).\n    *   We can use the initial concentrations of the buffer components as a very good approximation for their equilibrium concentrations.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4³⁻] concentration.**\n    *   The concentration of PO4³⁻ is determined by the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka3.\n    *   Equilibrium reaction: HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻\n    *   Ka3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n    *   We rearrange this to solve for [PO4³⁻]: [PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * ([HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺]).\n    *   We use the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of HPO4²⁻ (since its dissociation is negligible due to the very small Ka3).\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\n\n# Masses\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\n\n# Volume\nvolume_L = 0.200  # L\n\n# Acid dissociation constants\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations\n# Moles of H2PO4-\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\n\n# Moles of HPO4^2-\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate [H+] using the buffer equation (from Ka2)\n# We assume the initial concentrations are the equilibrium concentrations for this buffer system.\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n# We use the initial concentration of HPO4^2- as it changes negligibly.\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation to match the options.\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.23e-07\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻) is 6.23x10⁻⁷ M.

    "The user wants to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\nThe solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O).\n*   KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely in water to give K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ ions.\n*   Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates completely in water to give 2Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻ ions (and releases the water of hydration).\n\nThe key species are H₂PO₄⁻ (a weak acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (its conjugate base). These form a buffer solution. The relevant equilibria for the phosphate system are:\n1.  H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻  (Ka₁ = 7.5 x 10⁻³)\n2.  H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻  (Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸)\n3.  HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻  (Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²)\n\nThe orthophosphate ion is PO₄³⁻, which is produced in the third equilibrium.\n\n**2. Calculate Initial Concentrations**\nFirst, we need to calculate the molar concentrations of the buffer components, H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.\n\n*   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n*   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄):\n    *   Moles = mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Concentration [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O):\n    *   Moles = mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Concentration [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**\nThe pH (and thus the [H⁺]) of the buffer is primarily controlled by the second equilibrium (Ka₂) because the main components are H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation or the Ka₂ expression.\n\nFrom the Ka₂ expression:\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**\nNow we can use the third equilibrium (Ka₃) to find the concentration of PO₄³⁻.\n\nFrom the Ka₃ expression:\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nWe use the [HPO₄²⁻] and [H⁺] we've already calculated. The amount of HPO₄²⁻ that dissociates is negligible because Ka₃ is very small, so we can use its initial concentration.\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**5. Final Check and Answer Selection**\nThe calculated value is 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M. Rounding this to three significant figures gives 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\nThis matches option D.\n\nThe provided code output `6.24e-07` confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
