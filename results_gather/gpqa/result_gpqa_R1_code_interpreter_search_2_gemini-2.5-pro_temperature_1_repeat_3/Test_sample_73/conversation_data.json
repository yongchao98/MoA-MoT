    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a random process. The probability of a single atomic nucleus decaying in a given time interval is constant and independent of the nucleus's age. This is known as the **memoryless property**. The decay follows an exponential distribution.\n\n**2. Define the Mathematical Model**\n\nLet `T` be the random variable representing the time of decay. The probability that the atom has *not* decayed by time `t` (i.e., the survival probability) is given by the survival function:\n`P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant.\n\nThe probability that the atom *has* decayed by time `t` is:\n`P(T ≤ t) = 1 - P(T > t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n**3. Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n`P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n`1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\nWe can solve for `λ` by taking the natural logarithm of both sides, but it's often easier to work with the `e^(-λt)` term directly.\n\n**4. Formulate the Question Mathematically**\n\nWe are asked to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, *given* that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\nThis is a conditional probability:\n`P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)`\n`= P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)`\n\n**5. Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nThe memoryless property of exponential decay simplifies this calculation significantly. It states that the probability of decay in a future interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived.\nTherefore:\n`P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`\n\nThis means the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Probability**\n\nWe need to calculate `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n\nWe know from Step 3 that `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`. We can use this to find `e^(-150λ)`.\n`e^(-150λ) = e^(-1.5 * 100λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n`e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nNow we can compute the value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We know that the probability of survival for 100 minutes is 0.68.\n# We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property, this is the same as the probability of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n# Probability of decay in 150 mins = 1 - (Probability of survival for 150 mins)\n# Probability of survival for 150 mins = (Probability of survival for 100 mins)^(150/100)\n# Probability of survival for 150 mins = (0.68)^1.5\n\nprob_survival_150 = 0.68 ** 1.5\nprob_decay_150 = 1 - prob_survival_150\n\n# Print the result as a percentage\nprint(f\"The probability of decay is {prob_decay_150 * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\nThe probability of decay is 43.93%\n\nThe calculated probability is approximately 43.93%. Looking at the options:\nA) 40%\nB) 48%\nC) 52%\nD) 44%\n\nThe closest answer is 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An excellent job in setting up the problem and using the code interpreter to perform the calculation. Here's the final breakdown of the steps:\n\n**1. Understanding the Principle**\nThe key principle governing radioactive decay is that it is a **memoryless process**. This means the probability of a nucleus decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying in the future.\n\n**2. Finding the Decay Parameter**\nLet `P_decay(t)` be the probability of decaying within a time `t`, and `P_survival(t)` be the probability of surviving for time `t`.\nWe are given that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%:\n`P_decay(100) = 0.32`\n\nThis means the survival probability for 100 minutes is:\n`P_survival(100) = 1 - P_decay(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nThe survival probability is described by the equation `P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. So, `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Required Probability**\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is the same as finding the probability that a brand new atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n`P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150)`\n\nWe need to find `P_survival(150) = e^(-150λ)`. We can calculate this using the value we found in the previous step:\n`e^(-150λ) = e^(-1.5 * 100λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5 = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\nUsing the value from the code execution:\n` (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n\nSo, the probability of surviving for 150 minutes is approximately 56.07%.\nThe probability of decaying within 150 minutes is:\n`P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\nThis is equal to 43.93%.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe probability of 43.93% is closest to the given option D) 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
