    "Here's a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Concept:** The problem involves two reference frames moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (60,000 km/s is 20% of the speed of light). This indicates that the principles of Special Relativity must be applied, specifically time dilation.\n\n2.  **Define the Reference Frames:**\n    *   **Frame S (The Galaxy's reference frame):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance.\n    *   **Frame S' (The ejecta's reference frame):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The clock in this frame measures the proper time.\n\n3.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame), which is the proper time, `t_0 = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s` (a standard physical constant).\n\n4.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   Find the distance `d` that the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (Frame S).\n\n5.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   To find the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame, we need the velocity `v` of the ejecta in that frame and the time `t` that has passed in that frame. The formula is `d = v * t`.\n    *   We are given `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   We are *not* given `t` (the time in the Galaxy's frame). We are given `t_0` (the time in the ejecta's frame).\n    *   We need to use the time dilation formula to find `t` from `t_0`. The formula is: `t = γ * t_0`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor `γ` is calculated using the formula: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n6.  **Execute the Plan (Step-by-Step Calculation):**\n\n    *   **Step A: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n        *   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n        *   `c = 300,000 km/s`\n        *   `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 6/30 = 1/5 = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step B: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²) `\n        *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) `\n        *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) `\n        *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step C: Calculate the time `t` in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        *   `t = γ * t_0`\n        *   `t = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step D: Calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        *   `d = v * t`\n        *   `d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n7.  **Perform the final calculation.** A calculator or a simple script is useful here for accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants and given values\nv = 60000  # velocity in km/s\nt0 = 50    # proper time in seconds\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\nbeta_squared = (v/c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Calculate the time 't' in the Galaxy's reference frame\nt_galaxy = gamma * t0\n\n# Calculate the distance 'd' traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance_galaxy = v * t_galaxy\n\nprint(f\"{distance_galaxy=}\")\n```\n>\n>distance_galaxy=3061862.1784789725\n\n8.  **Analyze the Result and Choose the Answer:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n    *   Looking at the options:\n        *   A) 2,940,000 km\n        *   B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the non-relativistic answer: 60,000 km/s * 50 s)\n        *   C) 3,060,000 km\n        *   D) 2,880,000 km\n    *   The calculated value is closest to 3,060,000 km.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** The problem involves two inertial reference frames moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light (60,000 km/s is 20% of the speed of light). This indicates that the effects of Special Relativity, specifically time dilation, must be considered.\n\n2.  **Define the reference frames:**\n    *   **The Galaxy's reference frame (S):** This is the frame in which we want to measure the distance traveled. Let's consider this the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   **The ejecta's reference frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time measured in this frame (50 seconds) is the proper time, denoted as `t₀`.\n\n3.  **List the known variables:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Proper time (time in the ejecta's frame), `t₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n4.  **Determine the objective:** We need to find the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). The formula for this distance is `d = v * t`, where `t` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n5.  **Apply the time dilation formula:** Due to time dilation, an observer in the Galaxy's frame will measure a longer time interval `t` than the time `t₀` measured in the ejecta's moving frame. The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `t = γ * t₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the time `t` in the Galaxy's frame:**\n    *   `t = t₀ / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   `t = 50 s / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   `t ≈ 50 s / 0.9798 ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n8.  **Calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame:**\n    *   `d = v * t`\n    *   `d = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n9.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   A) 2,940,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the incorrect, non-relativistic answer)\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
