    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Single-Particle System:**\n    The problem deals with particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are quantized and given by the formula:\n    $E_n = \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}$\n    where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), `h` is Planck's constant, and `m` is the mass of the particle.\n\n    The problem defines a unit of energy $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. We need to express the single-particle energy levels $E_n$ in terms of this unit `E`.\n    We know that the reduced Planck's constant $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$, which means $\\hbar^2 = \\frac{h^2}{4\\pi^2}$.\n    Let's substitute this into the expression for `E`:\n    $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 (\\frac{h^2}{4\\pi^2})}{2mL^2} = \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$\n    This shows that the given energy unit `E` is exactly the ground state energy for a single particle in the well ($E_1$ when n=1).\n    Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be written as:\n    $E_n = n^2 E$\n    So, the first few energy levels are:\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n    *   and so on.\n\n2.  **Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\n    The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Spin-1/2 particles are fermions, which means they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For a particle in this well, the state is defined by its energy level `n` and its spin (up or down). Consequently, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy:**\n    To find the ground state of the four-particle system, we fill the available energy levels from the lowest energy upwards, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   We place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, `n=1`. The energy contributed by these two particles is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times E = 2E$.\n    *   We place the remaining two particles in the next lowest energy level, `n=2`. The energy contributed by these two particles is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n    *   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n        $E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy:**\n    The first excited state is the state with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. It is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2`, and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n    *   We move one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy of this configuration is:\n        $E_{1st\\_excited} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy:**\n    The second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state.\n    *   **Ground State Configuration:** (2 particles in n=1), (2 particles in n=2). Energy = 10E.\n    *   **First Excited State Configuration:** (2 in n=1), (1 in n=2), (1 in n=3). Energy = 15E.\n    *   **Other possible excited configurations:**\n        *   **Excitation A:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes (1 in n=1), (2 in n=2), (1 in n=3).\n            *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n        *   **Excitation B:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes (2 in n=1), (2 in n=3).\n            *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   Comparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, ...), the first excited state has energy 15E, and the second lowest excited state has energy 18E.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Ground state energy = **10E**\n*   First excited state energy = **15E**\n*   Second excited state energy = **18E**\n\nThis sequence of energies matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
