    "This problem requires a two-part calculation. First, we determine the amount of acid needed to react with the iron(III) hydroxide. Second, we calculate the additional amount of acid required to achieve the final specified pH in the solution. The sum of these two amounts will give us the total acid needed.\n\n**Part 1: Stoichiometric Calculation**\n\n1.  **Chemical Reaction:** The dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide, a weak base, by a strong monobasic acid (represented by H+) follows this reaction:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    This equation shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\n2.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** We need to calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as:\n        M(Fe) + 3 × M(O) + 3 × M(H) = 55.845 + 3(15.999) + 3(1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 0.00093576 mol.\n\n3.  **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:** From the stoichiometry (1:3 ratio), the moles of H⁺ required to react completely with the Fe(OH)₃ are:\n    Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093576 mol = 0.0028073 mol.\n\n**Part 2: Acid for Final pH**\n\nAfter the Fe(OH)₃ has dissolved, the resulting 100 cm³ solution will contain excess H⁺ ions, which determines its final pH. The problem becomes a multiple-choice question where we must find the option (a pair of pH and acid volume) that is chemically and mathematically consistent.\n\nWe can test each option by calculating the required volume of acid based on its given pH and comparing it to the volume provided in the option.\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ added from the acid is the sum of the moles needed for the reaction and the moles needed to remain in excess to establish the final pH.\nTotal Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (excess)\n\nWhere:\n*   Moles H⁺ (excess) = [H⁺]final × Total Volume\n*   [H⁺]final = 10^(-pH)\n*   Total Volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n*   Volume of Acid (cm³) = (Total Moles H⁺ / Concentration of Acid) × 1000\n*   Concentration of Acid = 0.1 M\n\nLet's check the options:\n\n**A) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n*   [H⁺]final = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ = 0.00912 M\n*   Moles H⁺ (excess) = 0.00912 M × 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.0028073 + 0.000912 = 0.0037193 mol\n*   Required Volume = (0.0037193 mol / 0.1 M) × 1000 = 37.19 cm³. This does not match 28.05 cm³.\n\n**B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   [H⁺]final = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ = 0.00204 M\n*   Moles H⁺ (excess) = 0.00204 M × 0.1 L = 0.000204 mol\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.0028073 + 0.000204 = 0.0030113 mol\n*   Required Volume = (0.0030113 mol / 0.1 M) × 1000 = 30.11 cm³. This value is extremely close to the given 30.09 cm³, with the small difference attributable to rounding. This option is consistent.\n\n**C) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n*   [H⁺]final = 10⁻⁴·⁹⁴ ≈ 1.15 × 10⁻⁵ M\n*   Moles H⁺ (excess) = (1.15 × 10⁻⁵ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000001 mol (negligible)\n*   Total Moles H⁺ ≈ 0.0028073 mol\n*   Required Volume = (0.0028073 mol / 0.1 M) × 1000 = 28.07 cm³. This does not match 20.40 cm³.\n\n**D) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n*   [H⁺]final = 10⁻³·¹⁶ = 0.000692 M\n*   Moles H⁺ (excess) = 0.000692 M × 0.1 L = 0.0000692 mol\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.0028073 + 0.0000692 = 0.0028765 mol\n*   Required Volume = (0.0028765 mol / 0.1 M) × 1000 = 28.77 cm³. This does not match 32.14 cm³.\n\nThe calculations show that only option B provides a consistent set of values for pH and the volume of acid required.\n\n**Verification using the solubility product (Ksp):**\nFor the Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved, the ion product (Qsp) must be less than or equal to the Ksp. At the point of minimum acid addition, the solution is saturated, so Qsp = Ksp.\n*   [Fe³⁺] = 0.00093576 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009358 M\n*   At pH 2.69, [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹⁴ / [H⁺] = 10⁻¹⁴ / 10⁻²·⁶⁹ = 10⁻¹¹·³¹ M\n*   Qsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (0.009358) × (10⁻¹¹·³¹ )³ ≈ 1.1 × 10⁻³⁶\nThis value for the solubility product is within the range reported for Fe(OH)₃, confirming the plausibility of the conditions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
