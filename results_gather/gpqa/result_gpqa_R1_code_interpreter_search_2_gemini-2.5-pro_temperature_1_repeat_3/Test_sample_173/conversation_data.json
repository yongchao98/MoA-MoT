    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus with rest mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n    *   Its initial total energy is `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of their rest masses is `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments are moving with kinetic energies `T1` and `T2` and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for `m1` and `m2`:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we find their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released in the fission is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This energy, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n\n`Q = E_initial_rest - E_final_rest`\n`Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\n`T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, we use the following principles:\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    `p1 = p2 = p`\n*   **Kinetic Energy:** The classical formula is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n\nFrom these, we can establish a ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T1_cla = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n`T2_cla = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nDividing the two equations:\n`T1_cla / T2_cla = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n`T1_cla / T2_cla = (99 GeV/c^2) / (198 GeV/c^2) = 1/2`\nThis means `T2_cla = 2 * T1_cla`.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy equation:\n`T1_cla + T2_cla = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cla + 2 * T1_cla = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_cla = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cla = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1\n\nIn special relativity, we use the same conservation laws but with relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `p1 = p2 = p` (magnitudes are equal).\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    This can be rewritten in terms of kinetic energy `T = E - m*c^2`:\n    `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`\n\nSince the momenta `p` are equal for both fragments:\n`(p*c)^2 = T1_rel^2 + 2 * T1_rel * (m1*c^2)`\n`(p*c)^2 = T2_rel^2 + 2 * T2_rel * (m2*c^2)`\n\nTherefore:\n`T1_rel^2 + 2 * T1_rel * (m1*c^2) = T2_rel^2 + 2 * T2_rel * (m2*c^2)`\n\nWe know `T2_rel = 3 GeV - T1_rel`. Let's substitute this and the mass-energy values (let `T1` stand for `T1_rel` for simplicity, all units in GeV):\n`m1*c^2 = 198`\n`m2*c^2 = 99`\n\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * 198 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * 99`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1_rel = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1_rel = 1005 MeV`\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe final step is to calculate the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n`Difference = T1_rel - T1_cla`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV`\n`Difference = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<D>>>"
