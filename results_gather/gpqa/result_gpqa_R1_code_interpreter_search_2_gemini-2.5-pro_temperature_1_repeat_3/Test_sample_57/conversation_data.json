    "*   **Analyze the options:**\n\n    *   **A) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory describes electricity, magnetism, and light. A major problem in classical electrodynamics is the \"self-energy\" of a point charge. The energy stored in the electric field of a point-like electron is infinite. To get a finite answer, one must introduce a cutoff, which is a form of regularization. So, this theory does have a high-energy (or short-distance) problem that requires a form of regularization.\n\n    *   **B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum field theory (QFT) that describes the strong nuclear force. Like all interacting QFTs in the Standard Model, calculations of physical quantities (like scattering amplitudes) using perturbation theory lead to infinite results. These infinities arise from loop diagrams that involve virtual particles with arbitrarily high energy. To handle these infinities, a procedure called regularization (e.g., dimensional regularization) is used to make the integrals temporarily finite. This is followed by renormalization, which absorbs the infinities into the definitions of physical parameters. Therefore, QCD absolutely requires regularization.\n\n    *   **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum field theory of the electromagnetic force. It was the first theory where the techniques of regularization and renormalization were successfully applied to tame the infinities appearing in calculations. Like QCD, it is a point-particle quantum field theory and suffers from ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences in loop calculations. Thus, it requires regularization.\n\n    *   **D) Superstring Theory:** Superstring theory is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify all fundamental forces of nature, including gravity. Unlike the other theories, its fundamental entities are not point-like particles but one-dimensional \"strings\". The interactions in string theory are not localized at a single point in spacetime but are \"smeared out.\" This smearing effect, a direct consequence of the string's extended nature, naturally resolves the ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences that plague point-particle quantum field theories. Calculations of scattering amplitudes in superstring theory are believed to be finite without the need for an external regularization procedure. The finite size of the string acts as a natural regulator.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    Classical Electrodynamics, QED, and QCD all exhibit divergences at high energies (short distances) and therefore require a regularization procedure to make physical calculations meaningful. Superstring Theory, due to its fundamental objects being extended strings rather than points, is believed to be a \"UV-finite\" theory, meaning it does not suffer from these high-energy divergences and thus does not require regularization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
