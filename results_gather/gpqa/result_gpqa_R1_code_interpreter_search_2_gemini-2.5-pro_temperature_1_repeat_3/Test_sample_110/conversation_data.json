    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a Michael addition reaction. It involves the addition of a nucleophile (an enolate) to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor).\n2.  **Identify the reactants and reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base used to form the enolate from the ketone.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n3.  **Formation of the enolate (the nucleophile):**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) removes an acidic α-proton from the ketone. The α-carbons are the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let's number the ring with the carbonyl carbon as C1.\n        *   **C2:** is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n        *   **C6:** is bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. The bulky t-BuOK base abstracts the proton from C6 to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n4.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate, with the negative charge localized on C6, acts as a nucleophile.\n    *   It attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n5.  **Protonation (Workup):**\n    *   The resulting intermediate is an enolate of the ester, which is then protonated (usually by a mild acid in the workup step) to give the final neutral product. The new side chain attached to C6 is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n6.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product A:**\n    *   The product has the original cyclohexanone ring, but now with a `(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)` group attached to C6.\n    *   To name the final product, we can treat the complex cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The cyclohexyl ring is attached to carbon 3 of this chain.\n    *   Now, we must name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment to the main chain is numbered C1. The functional groups on the ring are then given the lowest possible locants.\n        *   Attachment point (our original C6) is **C1**. This carbon has a **methyl group**.\n        *   The carbonyl group is adjacent, at **C2** (this was our original C1). This is an **oxo** group.\n        *   The next carbon, **C3**, has an **ethyl** and a **methyl** group (this was our original C2).\n    *   So, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Combining everything, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n2.  **Identify the reactants and reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon α to the nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). This base deprotonates the 1-nitropropane.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n3.  **Formation of the nitronate anion (the nucleophile):**\n    *   The hydroxide ion (OH⁻ from KOH) removes a proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane.\n    *   `CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + OH⁻ → CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂ (nitronate anion) + H₂O`\n4.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the (E)-but-2-enenitrile (the carbon atom bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n5.  **Protonation (Workup):**\n    *   The resulting carbanion intermediate is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product B.\n6.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   Let's trace the carbon backbone of the product:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-`\n        *   From but-2-enenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   Combining these gives the structure: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1. The chain is 6 carbons long, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering the chain from C1 (the nitrile carbon):\n        `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nOption D correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<D>>>"
