    "I need to determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole given its angular size and distance.\n\n**1.

Relevant Formulas:**\n*   **Small-angle approximation:** For a small angle θ (in radians), the size of an object (D) at a distance (d) is given by D ≈ θ * d. The radius (R) is D/2, so R ≈ (θ * d) / 2. In our case, the radius is the Schwarzschild radius (R_s).\n*   **Area of the event horizon (A):** The event horizon is assumed to be a sphere, so its area is A = 4 * π * R_s^2.\n*   **Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (S):** The entropy of a black hole is given by the formula:\n    S = (k_B * c^3 * A) / (4 * G * ħ)\n    Where:\n    *   k_B = Boltzmann constant (≈ 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K)\n    *   c = Speed of light (≈ 3.00 x 10^8 m/s)\n    *   G = Gravitational constant (≈ 6.67 x 10^-11 N m²/kg²)\n    *   ħ = Reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.05 x 10^-34 J·s)\n\n**3.
