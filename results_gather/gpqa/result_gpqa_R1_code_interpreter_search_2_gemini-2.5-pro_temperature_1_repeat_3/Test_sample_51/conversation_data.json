    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The core of the question is to find the factor by which the population ratio of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes when a star's effective temperature drops due to starspots. This factor is the ratio of the population ratio at the higher temperature (no spots) to the population ratio at the lower temperature (with spots).\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physical Principle:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Under this condition, the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms `N₂` in a higher energy state `E₂` to the number of atoms `N₁` in a lower energy state `E₁`:\n    \n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n    \n    Where:\n    *   `g₁` and `g₂` are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n    *   `E₂ - E₁` (or `ΔE`) is the energy difference between the two levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n4.  **Define the Ratios for Both Scenarios:**\n    *   Let `R_nospots` be the ratio when the star has no spots, at temperature `T_nospots` = 6000 K.\n    *   Let `R_spots` be the ratio when the star has spots, at temperature `T_spots` = 5500 K.\n    \n    `R_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)]`\n    `R_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]`\n\n5.  **Determine the Required Factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This means we need to calculate the fraction `R_nospots / R_spots`.\n    \n    Factor = `R_nospots / R_spots`\n    \n    Factor = `[(g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)]] / [(g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]]`\n    \n    The statistical weights `(g₂ / g₁)` cancel out:\n    \n    Factor = `exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]`\n    \n    Using the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n    \n    Factor = `exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]`\n    Factor = `exp[ -ΔE/k * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]`\n    Factor = `exp[ ΔE/k * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The problem provides the wavelength `λ` of the photon corresponding to the transition between the two energy levels. The energy of this photon is equal to the energy difference `ΔE`.\n    \n    `ΔE = h * c / λ`\n    \n    Where:\n    *   `h` is Planck's constant.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `λ` = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n\n7.  **Substitute ΔE into the Factor Equation:**\n    \n    Factor = `exp[ (h * c / (λ * k)) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]`\n\n8.  **Gather Constants and Perform Calculation:** Now, we plug in the values for the physical constants and the given temperatures to compute the final factor. This calculation is best performed using a script to ensure precision.\n\n    *   `h` (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   `c` (speed of light) ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   `k` (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   `λ` = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   `T_nospots` = 6000 K\n    *   `T_spots` = 5500 K\n\nThe following Python code will execute this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the physical constants in SI units\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant (J·s)\nc = 299792458      # Speed of light (m/s)\nk = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann constant (J/K)\n\n# Define the given parameters\nlambda_m = 1448e-10      # Wavelength in meters (1448 Å)\nT_nospots = 6000         # Temperature without spots (K)\nT_spots = 5500           # Temperature with spots (K)\n\n# Calculate the exponent term for the factor calculation\n# Factor = exp[ (h * c / (lambda_m * k)) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\nexponent_term = (h * c) / (lambda_m * k)\ntemp_term = (1 / T_spots) - (1 / T_nospots)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = math.exp(exponent_term * temp_term)\n\nprint(factor)\n```\n<execute_result>\n4.506548970030589\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 4.507.

Identify the Physics:**\n\n*   The problem asks for the ratio of populations of two energy levels at a given temperature.\n*   The condition of LTE means we can use the Boltzmann equation to describe this population ratio.\n\n**3. Formulate the Equations:**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms `N_i` in an energy state `E_i` with statistical weight `g_i` to the number of atoms `N_j` in an energy state `E_j` with statistical weight `g_j`:\n\n`N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp[-(E_i - E_j) / (k * T)]`\n\nLet's define our states:\n*   Level 1: Energy `E₁`, statistical weight `g₁`\n*   Level 2: Energy `E₂`, statistical weight `g₂`\n\nThe population ratio `R` is `N₂ / N₁`:\n\n`R(T) = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]`\n\nWe need to find the factor `F`, which is the ratio of the population ratios at the two different temperatures:\n\n`F = R(T_nospots) / R(T_spots)`\n\n`F = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_nospots)] ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_spots)] ]`\n\nThe `(g₂ / g₁)` term cancels out. Let `ΔE = E₂ - E₁`.\n\n`F = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]`\n\nUsing the property of exponents `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n\n`F = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]`\n`F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]`\n\n**4.

Substitute `ΔE` into the Factor Equation:**\n\n`F = exp[ (h * c / (λ * k)) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]`\n\n**6. Plan the Calculation:**\n\n*   I have all the necessary values:\n    *   `h` (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   `c` (speed of light) ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   `k` (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   `λ = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n    *   `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n    *   `T_spots = 5500 K`\n*   The calculation involves several constants and exponentiation, making it a good candidate for a Python script to ensure accuracy. The information about the stellar radius, mass, and percentage of spot coverage is extraneous to this specific calculation. The problem provides the relevant effective temperatures directly.\n\n**7.
