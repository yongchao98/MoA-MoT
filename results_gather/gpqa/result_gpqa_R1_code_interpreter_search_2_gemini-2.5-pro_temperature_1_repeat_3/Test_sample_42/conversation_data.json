    "This problem requires a systematic approach to determine the structure of a complex organic molecule from its description and then apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to find the correct name.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Molecular Description**\n\n1.  **Parent Structure**: The molecule is based on a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This makes it a derivative of **benzoic acid**. According to IUPAC rules, the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group, so the carbon atom it's attached to is designated as **C1**.\n\n2.  **Major Substituent Positions**:\n    *   A carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO, also called formyl), and a cyano group (-CN) are all **meta to one another**.\n    *   If the -COOH is at C1, meta positions are C3 and C5. To be meta to each other, the three groups must occupy positions 1, 3, and 5. So, we have {-COOH at C1, -CHO at C3/C5, -CN at C5/C3}.\n\n3.  **Other Substituent Positions (relative to C1)**:\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH) is **ortho** to the carboxylic acid (at C2 or C6).\n    *   A dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) is **ortho** to the carboxylic acid (at C2 or C6).\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is **para** to the carboxylic acid (at C4).\n\n4.  **Final Constraint**:\n    *   The methoxy (-OCH3) and the alcohol (-OH) are both **ortho** to the nitrile (-CN).\n\n### **Step 2: Assemble the Structure**\n\nLet's use the information to build the only possible structure.\n\n*   **-COOH** is at **C1**.\n*   **-OCH3** is at **C4** (para to C1).\n*   The **-CHO** and **-CN** groups are at C3 and C5.\n*   The **-OH** and **-N(CH3)2** groups are at C2 and C6.\n\nNow, let's use the final constraint: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n\n*   The methoxy group is at C4. For it to be ortho to the nitrile (-CN), the nitrile must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent.\n*   The alcohol (-OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n    *   **Case A: Assume -CN is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is already occupied by -OCH3, the -OH group must be at **C2**.\n    *   **Case B: Assume -CN is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is already occupied by -OCH3, the -OH group must be at **C6**.\n\nLet's follow **Case A**:\n*   If -OH is at C2, then the other ortho position, C6, must be occupied by -N(CH3)2.\n*   If -CN is at C3, then the other meta position, C5, must be occupied by -CHO.\n*   This gives us one complete and consistent structure:\n    *   **C1**: -COOH\n    *   **C2**: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   **C3**: -CN (cyano)\n    *   **C4**: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   **C5**: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   **C6**: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n(If we had followed Case B, we would get the mirror image of this structure, which represents the same molecule but with a different numbering direction).\n\n### **Step 3: Apply IUPAC Naming Rules**\n\n1.  **Parent Name**: benzoic acid.\n2.  **Numbering**: C1 is fixed. We must number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Since the ring is fully substituted from C2 to C6, the locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} regardless of direction. In such cases, we give the lowest locant to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n3.  **Alphabetical Order of Substituents**:\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n4.  **Assign Locants**: We have two possible numbering directions (clockwise or counter-clockwise from C1).\n    *   **Direction 1 (as derived in Step 2)**:\n        *   C2: hydroxy\n        *   C3: cyano\n        *   C5: formyl\n        *   C6: dimethylamino\n    *   **Direction 2 (the other way around)**:\n        *   C2: dimethylamino\n        *   C3: formyl\n        *   C5: cyano\n        *   C6: hydroxy\n\n    We compare the locants assigned to the alphabetically-first substituent, \"cyano\".\n    *   In Direction 1, cyano is at C3.\n    *   In Direction 2, cyano is at C5.\n    Since 3 is lower than 5, **Direction 1 is the correct numbering scheme**.\n\n5.  **Construct the Final Name**: Using the correct numbering (Direction 1) and listing the substituents alphabetically:\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n    *   ...benzoic acid\n\nCombining these parts gives the full IUPAC name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
