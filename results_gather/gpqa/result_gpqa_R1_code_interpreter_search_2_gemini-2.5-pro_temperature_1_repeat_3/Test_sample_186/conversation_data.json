    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Detection Criteria**\n\nThe problem asks whether a star is \"detectable\". The criterion for detection is defined as achieving a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure using the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a single 8m VLT.\n\n**2. Determine the Limiting Magnitude of ESPRESSO**\n\nTo determine which stars are detectable, we need to find the faintest apparent magnitude (the limiting magnitude) that ESPRESSO can observe under the given conditions. The provided link to the ESPRESSO overview page contains this crucial information.\n\nAccording to the ESPRESSO instrument overview page, in the \"Performance\" section, it states: \"ESPRESSO is expected to reach a S/N of 10 in 1h for a G2V star of V=16.5 mag in the 1-UT mode.\"\n\n*   **S/N = 10:** Matches the problem's requirement.\n*   **Exposure time = 1 hour:** Matches the problem's requirement.\n*   **Mode = 1-UT (one Unit Telescope):** Matches the problem's requirement (one of the 8m VLT telescopes).\n\nTherefore, any star with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) of 16.5 or brighter (i.e., m_V ≤ 16.5) is considered detectable.\n\n**3. Check Observability from Paranal Observatory**\n\nA star must be visible in the sky from the observatory's location. The Paranal Observatory is in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\n*   **Paranal Latitude:** Approximately 24.6° South.\n\nA star's visibility depends on its declination (DEC).\n*   Stars with very high northern declinations are never visible from a southern observatory. The northern limit for visibility at Paranal is approximately DEC < +65°.\n*   Stars with southern or equatorial declinations are well-placed for observation.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Star**\n\nWe will now determine the apparent V magnitude and declination for each star to see if it meets the two criteria:\n1.  Is its apparent magnitude m_V ≤ 16.5?\n2.  Is it observable from Paranal (DEC < +65°)?\n\n---\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the night sky. Its apparent V magnitude is approximately -0.74.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** Its declination is approximately -52° 42'.\n*   **Evaluation:**\n    *   m_V = -0.74 ≤ 16.5. The star is extremely bright. **(Detectable)**\n    *   DEC = -52° 42' is in the southern sky, making it perfectly observable from Paranal. **(Observable)**\n*   **Conclusion:** Canopus is detectable.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** Polaris, the North Star, has an apparent V magnitude of approximately +1.98.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** Its declination is approximately +89° 16'.\n*   **Evaluation:**\n    *   m_V = +1.98 ≤ 16.5. The star is bright enough.\n    *   DEC = +89° 16' is very close to the North Celestial Pole. It is far too north to be seen from Paranal's southern latitude of -24.6°. The star will never rise above the horizon. **(Not Observable)**\n*   **Conclusion:** Polaris is not detectable from Paranal.\n\n**c) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 10 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** We use the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5`.\n    `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 * 1 - 5 = 15`.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** Given as 0°.\n*   **Evaluation:**\n    *   m_V = 15 ≤ 16.5. The star is bright enough. **(Detectable)**\n    *   DEC = 0° (on the celestial equator) is perfectly observable from Paranal. **(Observable)**\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is detectable.\n\n**d) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 200 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** `m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5`.\n    `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5`. Since log10(200) ≈ 2.30, `m_V ≈ 15 + 5 * 2.30 - 5 = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5`.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** Given as 0°.\n*   **Evaluation:**\n    *   m_V = 21.5 > 16.5. The star is too faint. **(Not Detectable)**\n    *   DEC = 0° is observable.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is not detectable.\n\n**e) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 5 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** `m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5`.\n    `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5`. Since log10(5) ≈ 0.70, `m_V ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.70 - 5 = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5`.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** Given as 0°.\n*   **Evaluation:**\n    *   m_V = 13.5 ≤ 16.5. The star is bright enough. **(Detectable)**\n    *   DEC = 0° is observable. **(Observable)**\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is detectable.\n\n**f) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 50 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** `m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5`.\n    `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5`. Since log10(50) ≈ 1.70, `m_V ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.70 - 5 = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5`.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** Given as 0°.\n*   **Evaluation:**\n    *   m_V = 18.5 > 16.5. The star is too faint. **(Not Detectable)**\n    *   DEC = 0° is observable.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is not detectable.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Detectable Stars**\n\nLet's count the number of stars that are detectable:\n*   a) Canopus: **Yes**\n*   b) Polaris: **No** (not observable)\n*   c) Star at 10 pc: **Yes**\n*   d) Star at 200 pc: **No** (too faint)\n*   e) Star at 5 pc: **Yes**\n*   f) Star at 50 pc: **No** (too faint)\n\nThere are a total of 3 detectable stars.\n\n<<<B>>>"
