    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a decay from the hydrogen atom state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through a two-step electric dipole (E1) transition. This means a cascade decay involving the emission of two photons.\n\n2.  **Recall the selection rules for E1 transitions:**\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n$, is not restricted ($\\Delta n = \\text{any integer}$).\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0$ or $\\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Determine the possible transition path:** The process is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_1} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_2} |1,0,0\\rangle$. We need to identify the intermediate state(s) $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **First transition:** From $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Initial state has $l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Applying the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l' = l \\pm 1 = 0 \\pm 1 = 1$.\n        *   Applying the selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' = m + \\Delta m = 0 + (0, \\pm 1) = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   For a spontaneous decay, the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number must decrease ($n' < n=3$). The lowest possible value for $n'$ when $l'=1$ is $n'=2$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** From an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check if this is allowed. The initial state is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ ($l'=1$) and the final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ($l_f=0$).\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the selection rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. For the transition to be allowed, we need $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. This is true for all possible intermediate states ($m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$).\n        *   Also, note that the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (2p level) can only decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (1s level) via an E1 transition, as there are no other lower energy states that satisfy the selection rules. Thus, the branching ratio for this second step is 1.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability (branching ratio) for each path:**\n    *   We have three possible decay routes, each passing through a different intermediate state:\n        1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n        2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n        3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   The \"probability\" in the question refers to the branching ratio: the probability of the atom taking one specific path out of all the possible paths for this two-photon decay.\n    *   Since the second step of the cascade is guaranteed to happen (branching ratio of 1), the relative probability of each of the three paths is determined entirely by the relative rates of the first transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   The rate of a spontaneous E1 transition ($W$) is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n        $W \\propto |\\langle n',l',m'| e\\vec{r} |n,l,m\\rangle|^2$.\n    *   We need to compare the rates for the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n    *   The initial state, $|3,0,0\\rangle$, is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). A key principle in quantum mechanics (related to the Wigner-Eckart theorem) states that for a transition from a spherically symmetric state, the decay rates to each of the magnetic sublevels ($m'$) of a final state with a given $l'$ are equal.\n    *   In this case, the rates for the transitions to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are identical.\n    *   Let the rate for each of these transitions be $R$. The total rate for the first step is the sum of the rates to all possible final states: $R_{total} = R_{m'=-1} + R_{m'=0} + R_{m'=1} = R + R + R = 3R$.\n    *   The probability (branching ratio) of transitioning via a specific intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is the rate for that specific transition divided by the total rate:\n        $P(\\text{path via } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{R_{m'=0}}{R_{total}} = \\frac{R}{3R} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   Similarly, the probability for the paths via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ are also both $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe correct transition route and probability is the one described in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
