    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 * k * r^2 + 3/2 * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\nTo solve the Schrödinger equation more easily, we should convert this potential into Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\nx = r * cos(θ)\ny = r * sin(θ)\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nFrom these relationships, we can see that:\nx^2 = (r * cos(θ))^2 = r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\nNow, substitute these into the potential expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * (x^2)\n\nLet's simplify the expression by combining the terms with x^2:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 * k * x^2 + 3/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n**2. Separate the Schrödinger Equation**\n\nThe potential V(x, y) is now expressed as a sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\nV_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2\nV_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2\n\nThis form of potential is that of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Because the potential is separable, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be separated into two one-dimensional equations. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies from the x and y motions, E = E_x + E_y.\n\n**3. Solve for the Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form V(z) = 1/2 * k_eff * z^2 are given by:\nE_n = (n + 1/2) * ħ * ω\nwhere the angular frequency ω is given by ω = sqrt(k_eff / m).\n\nLet's apply this to our two separate potentials.\n\n**For the x-direction:**\nThe potential is V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2. To match the standard form V(z) = 1/2 * k_eff * z^2, we can write:\nV_x(x) = 1/2 * (4k) * x^2\nSo, the effective spring constant for the x-direction is k_x = 4k.\n\nThe angular frequency for the x-motion is:\nω_x = sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are (with quantum number n_x = 0, 1, 2, ...):\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * ω_x\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * (2 * sqrt(k / m))\nE_nx = (2n_x + 1) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n**For the y-direction:**\nThe potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2. This is already in the standard form.\nSo, the effective spring constant for the y-direction is k_y = k.\n\nThe angular frequency for the y-motion is:\nω_y = sqrt(k_y / m) = sqrt(k / m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are (with quantum number n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...):\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * ω_y\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n**4. Find the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E of the particle is the sum of the energies from the independent x and y motions:\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = [(2n_x + 1) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)] + [(n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)]\n\nNow, factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k / m):\nE = [(2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\nComparing our final result with the given options:\nA) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nC) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nOur derived energy spectrum matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
