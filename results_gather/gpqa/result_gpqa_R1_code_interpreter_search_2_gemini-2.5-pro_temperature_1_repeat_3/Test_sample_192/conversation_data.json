    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance (let's denote this as dN/dr) and the distance (r).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:** We are told that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx⁵. In astronomy, this phrasing typically refers to the number density per unit of parallax. So, we can write this relationship as:\n    dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵ = plx⁻⁵\n\n3.  **Recall the Fundamental Relationship between Distance and Parallax:** Parallax (plx) is defined as the inverse of the distance (r).\n    plx = 1/r\n    This also means r = 1/plx.\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Derivatives:** To find the relationship for dN/dr from the given dN/d(plx), we need to convert the differential element d(plx) to dr. The chain rule provides the way to do this:\n    dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Conversion Factor d(plx)/dr:** We need to differentiate the expression for parallax with respect to distance.\n    plx = 1/r = r⁻¹\n    d(plx)/dr = d(r⁻¹)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n\n    When we talk about the number of stars in a given range, we are concerned with the density or count, which is a positive quantity. Therefore, we use the magnitude of the derivative.\n    |d(plx)/dr| = |-1/r²| = 1/r²\n\n6.  **Substitute the Known Quantities into the Chain Rule Equation:** Now we substitute the given relationship (Step 2) and the conversion factor (Step 5) into the chain rule formula (Step 4).\n    dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|\n    dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (r):** The current expression has both plx and r. To find how dN/dr scales with r, we must express everything in terms of r. We use the relationship plx = 1/r.\n    Substitute plx = 1/r into the proportionality:\n    dN/dr ∝ ((1/r)⁻⁵) * (1/r²)\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    (1/r)⁻⁵ = (r⁻¹)⁻⁵ = r⁵\n    So the expression becomes:\n    dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)\n    dN/dr ∝ r⁵ * r⁻²\n    dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)\n    dN/dr ∝ r³\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe number of stars per unit range of distance, r, changes as r³. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
