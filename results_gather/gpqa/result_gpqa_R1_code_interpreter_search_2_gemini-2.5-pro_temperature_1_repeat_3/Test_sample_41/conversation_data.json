    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit around a star is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = [L * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * d²)]^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   L is the luminosity of the star.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   d is the orbital distance (semi-major axis).\n    *   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   π is the mathematical constant pi.\n\n    In this problem, all three planets orbit the same star, so L is constant. The problem states that the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets. The other terms (16, π, σ) are constants. Therefore, the formula simplifies to show that the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse square root of the orbital distance:\n    T_eq ∝ (1/d²)^(1/4)\n    T_eq ∝ 1/√d\n    This implies that d ∝ 1 / (T_eq)².\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Distance.**\n    Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (d):\n    P² ∝ d³\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    P ∝ d^(3/2)\n\n3.  **Combine the relationships to find the link between Orbital Period and Equilibrium Temperature.**\n    We can substitute the relationship for distance (d) from step 1 into the relationship for the period (P) from step 2:\n    P ∝ (1 / (T_eq)²)^(3/2)\n    P ∝ 1 / (T_eq)³\n\n    This means the ratio of the orbital periods of two planets (Planet_X and Planet_Y) is inversely proportional to the cube of the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures:\n    P_Y / P_X = (T_eq_X / T_eq_Y)³\n\n4.  **Calculate the required ratios.**\n    We need to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to Planet1 (P3 / P1). Using the formula from step 3:\n    P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³\n\n    We are given the following temperature ratios:\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4\n    *   T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3\n\n    We can find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3 by multiplying the given ratios:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    Now, substitute the value of (T_eq1 / T_eq3) back into the period ratio equation:\n    P3 / P1 = (3.22)³\n\n    To get the numerical value, we perform the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Ratio of equilibrium temperature T1/T2\nratio_T1_T2 = 1.4\n# Ratio of equilibrium temperature T2/T3\nratio_T2_T3 = 2.3\n\n# Calculate the ratio T1/T3\nratio_T1_T3 = ratio_T1_T2 * ratio_T2_T3\n\n# The relationship between period (P) and equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is P ∝ 1/(T_eq)³.\n# Therefore, P3/P1 = (T1/T3)³.\nratio_P3_P1 = ratio_T1_T3 ** 3\n\nprint(ratio_P3_P1)\n```\n>>>\n33.386248\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 33.4.\n\nNote: The information about the planets' masses and the TTV discovery method is extra information not needed for this specific calculation, as the question can be solved using the fundamental relationships between temperature, distance, and orbital period.\n\n<<<C>>>",
