    "*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the information from the spectra.**\n    *   **Compound type:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring implies a benzene ring with two substituents, having a base formula of C6H4.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (-COO-) is present. This adds 1 Carbon and 2 Oxygen atoms to the molecule.\n    *   **1H NMR - Aromatic Protons:** There are \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" For a di-substituted benzene ring, this pattern strongly indicates *para* (1,4) substitution. This would result in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, giving two signals (typically two doublets). This accounts for the C6H4 part of the structure.\n    *   **1H NMR - Vinyl Protons:** There are \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This is a very characteristic splitting pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). Let's analyze it:\n        *   `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`\n        *   The proton H(a) is split only by the adjacent H(b), so it appears as a doublet.\n        *   The proton H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (a quartet). Therefore, its signal is a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This fragment perfectly matches the description and has the formula C3H5.\n    *   **1H NMR - Methyl Protons:** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups.\"\n        *   One methyl group is the one in the propenyl fragment we just identified (-CH=CH-CH3). Its signal would be a doublet due to coupling with H(b).\n        *   The second methyl group must be associated with the ester. The simplest form is a methyl ester (-COOCH3). This methyl group would be a singlet, as there are no adjacent protons to couple with. This accounts for the second methyl signal. The -COOCH3 fragment has the formula C2H3O2.\n    *   **1H NMR - Absence of signals:** \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups.\" This is a critical piece of information that helps eliminate other possibilities.\n\n*   **Step 2: Assemble the deduced fragments.**\n    *   We have a *para*-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n    *   One substituent is the propenyl group (-C3H5).\n    *   The other substituent is the methyl ester group (-COOCH3).\n    *   The proposed structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. This structure has no -CH2- groups, consistent with the data.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the chemical formula of the proposed structure.**\n    *   From the benzene ring: C6H4\n    *   From the propenyl group: C3H5\n    *   From the methyl ester group: C2H3O2 (The carbon is already counted in the ester, so this part is -COOCH3, which adds C2H3O2 to the C6H4 base)\n    *   Adding these parts together:\n        *   Carbon atoms: 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = 11\n        *   Hydrogen atoms: 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = 12\n        *   Oxygen atoms: 2 (from C2H3O2) = 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Verify against the options.**\n    *   A) C11H14O2: This formula has 2 more hydrogens than our derived structure. This would imply the absence of the vinyl C=C double bond, which contradicts the NMR data.\n    *   B) C11H12O2: This matches our derived formula.\n    *   C) C12H14O2: This has an extra CH2 group compared to our derived structure. A likely structure would be ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. This would have a -CH2- signal (a quartet) from the ethyl group, which is explicitly ruled out by the problem statement.\n    *   D) C12H12O2: This formula has one more carbon and the same number of hydrogens as our derived structure. This would require an additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., another C=C bond or a ring), which would lead to a different structure that is inconsistent with the simple and specific NMR splitting patterns described.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only formula that fits all the criteria is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
