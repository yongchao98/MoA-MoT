    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has a relative intensity of 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a classic isotopic signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular weights of the options (using nominal masses: C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35). All options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Molecular Weight = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   All four options are consistent with the MS data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This signal is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch of a carboxylic acid (usually 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options B and C.\n    *   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acyl chloride/ester. It would have a C=O stretch at a much higher frequency (~1780 cm⁻¹) and would lack the broad O-H peak.\n    *   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde and a phenol. While it has an O-H group, a phenolic O-H stretch is typically less broad than a carboxylic acid's. It also lacks the specific carboxylic acid proton signal in the NMR.\n    *   We are now left with A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid and D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid, both of which are carboxylic acids.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (past 10 ppm) is characteristic of a highly deshielded proton. A singlet in this region integrating to one proton (1H) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This is consistent with both remaining options, A and D.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The key information is the splitting pattern and integration. We have two signals, each a doublet (d), and each integrating to two protons (2H). This pattern is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The two protons adjacent to one substituent are equivalent to each other, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. These two sets of protons are adjacent to each other, causing them to split each other into doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** Let's evaluate the remaining options based on this aromatic pattern.\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is 1,2-disubstituted (ortho). The four aromatic protons are all in different chemical environments, which would result in a complex pattern of four distinct signals (multiplets), not two simple doublets. This does not match the data.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is 1,4-disubstituted (para). It has a plane of symmetry through the C1-C4 axis. The two protons adjacent to the -COOH group are equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the -Cl atom are equivalent. This creates the exact \"two doublets, 2H each\" pattern observed in the spectrum. The electron-withdrawing carboxyl group deshields its adjacent protons more, so they appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons adjacent to the chlorine appear slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm).\n\n**Final Determination:**\nAll three pieces of spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) are perfectly consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
