    "This problem can be solved using the method of images.\n\n**1. The Method of Images**\n\nThe electric field and potential outside a grounded conducting sphere due to an external point charge 'q' can be calculated by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" 'q'' placed at a specific location inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge 'q' and the image charge 'q'' must produce a potential of V=0 on the surface where the sphere used to be.\n\n*   **System:** A point charge 'q' is at a distance 'd' from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius 'R'.\n*   **Equivalent System (for the region outside the sphere):** The point charge 'q' plus an image charge 'q'' located at a distance 'b' from the center, along the same line connecting the center to 'q'.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nFor the potential to be zero at any point on the surface of the sphere (r=R), the image charge and its position must be:\n\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R² / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b` from the center, inside the sphere. The original charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. The force acting on the charge `q` is due to the induced charges on the grounded sphere. By the method of images, this force is identical to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nA simpler way to calculate the potential energy (U) is to consider the energy of the real charge `q` in the potential created by the induced charges. The potential of the induced charges at the location of `q` is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThe potential energy U is given by:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere. This is equivalent to the potential produced by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n*   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n*   The potential at the position of `q` due to `q'` is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`V_induced = k * [-q * (R / d)] / [d - (R² / d)]`\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n`d - (R² / d) = (d² - R²) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n`V_induced = k * [-q * (R / d)] / [(d² - R²) / d]`\n`V_induced = -k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nFinally, calculate the potential energy `U`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d² - R²)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nThe factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charge distribution (and thus the potential it creates) is established as the charge `q` is brought in from infinity. The work done is an integral of force over distance, which leads to this factor. If the sphere had a fixed charge distribution (instead of an induced one), the factor of 1/2 would not be present.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
