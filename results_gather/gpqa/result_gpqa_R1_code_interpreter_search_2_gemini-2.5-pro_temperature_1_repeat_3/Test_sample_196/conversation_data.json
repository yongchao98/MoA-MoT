    "*   **Step 1: Decipher the structure of Compound X from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The broad absorption between **3400–2500 cm-1** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n        *   The strong absorption at **1720 cm-1** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at **1610 cm-1** and **1450 cm-1** are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet in the very downfield region is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is further downfield, suggesting these protons are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is therefore ortho to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Let's assemble the remaining signals to determine the structure of the alkyl group.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This suggests an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-) with multiple different neighbors.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to a methine group (-CH-). Its chemical shift indicates it is benzylic (attached directly to the aromatic ring).\n        *   **Assembling the Structure:**\n            *   The benzylic methine (-CH-) is attached to the ring.\n            *   This -CH- is attached to a methyl group (the 1.4 ppm doublet).\n            *   This -CH- is also attached to an ethyl group (the -CH₂- at 1.7 ppm and the -CH₃ at 0.9 ppm).\n            *   The complete alkyl group is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n        *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the final product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with **red phosphorus and HI**.\n    *   **Reagent Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). Other functional groups like ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols are also reduced to the corresponding alkanes. The aromatic ring and the alkyl substituent are stable under these conditions.\n    *   **Transformation:** The -COOH group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect.\n    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, not the final product.\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our predicted product.\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect, the alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
