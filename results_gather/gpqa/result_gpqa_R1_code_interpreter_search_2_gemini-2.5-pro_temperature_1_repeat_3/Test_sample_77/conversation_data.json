    "This problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Setting up the Problem\n\n*   **Charge:** A point charge `q`.\n*   **Trajectory:** The position of the charge at any time `t'` is given by the vector `s(t')`.\n*   **Velocity:** The velocity of the charge at time `t'` is `v(t') = d s(t') / dt'`.\n*   **Observation Point:** The field is measured at position `r` and time `t`.\n*   **Retarded Time (`tr`):** The electromagnetic signal (field) travels at the speed of light `c`. The signal observed at `(r, t)` was emitted by the charge at an earlier time `tr`, called the retarded time. The time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r` is `|r - s(tr)| / c`. Therefore, the retarded time `tr` is defined by the implicit equation:\n    `t = tr + |r - s(tr)| / c`\n\n*   **Key Vectors and Scalars (as per the problem statement):**\n    *   `v = v(tr)` is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   `d = r - s(tr)` is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n    *   `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|` is the distance between the retarded position and the observation point.\n\nWith this notation, the retarded time equation becomes `t = tr + d/c` or `d = c(t - tr)`.\n\n### 2. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials\n\nThe scalar and vector potentials for a time-varying charge distribution `ρ(r', t')` and current distribution `J(r', t')` are given by:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nwhere `tr = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\n### 3. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t')`, the charge and current densities are:\n`ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals makes them complicated because the retarded time `tr` depends on the integration variable `r'`. A standard method to solve this is to introduce another integration over time with another delta function.\n\nLet's evaluate the scalar potential `V(r, t)`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫∫ [q * δ³(r' - s(t')) / |r - r'|] * δ(t' - (t - |r - r'|/c)) dt' d³r'`\n\nFirst, we integrate over the spatial coordinates `d³r'`. The Dirac delta `δ³(r' - s(t'))` picks out the value of the rest of the integrand at `r' = s(t')`:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ q / |r - s(t')| * δ(t' - (t - |r - s(t')|/c)) dt'`\n\nNow we integrate over `t'`. The integral has the form `∫ f(x)δ(g(x))dx = f(x₀)/|g'(x₀)|` where `g(x₀)=0`.\nHere, `t'` is the integration variable. Let `f(t') = q / |r - s(t')|` and `g(t') = t' - t + |r - s(t')|/c`.\nThe condition `g(t') = 0` means `t' = t - |r - s(t')|/c`, which defines the retarded time `tr`. So, `t' = tr`.\n\nNext, we need the derivative `g'(t')`:\n`g'(t') = d/dt' [t' - t + (1/c)|r - s(t')|]`\n`g'(t') = 1 + (1/c) * d/dt' |r - s(t')|`\n\nLet `d(t') = r - s(t')`. Then `d(t') = |d(t')| = sqrt(d(t') ⋅ d(t'))`.\nThe derivative is `d/dt'(d) = (d(t') / d) ⋅ (d/dt' d(t')) = (d(t') / d) ⋅ (-v(t')) = - (d(t') ⋅ v(t')) / d`.\nLet `d̂(t') = d(t')/d` be the unit vector. Then `d/dt'(d) = - d̂(t') ⋅ v(t')`.\n\nSo, `g'(t') = 1 - (d̂(t') ⋅ v(t')) / c`.\nEvaluating at `t' = tr`, and using the notation from the problem statement (`d`, `d`, `v`):\n`g'(tr) = 1 - (d̂ ⋅ v) / c = 1 - (d ⋅ v) / (dc) = (dc - d ⋅ v) / dc`.\nThis factor must be positive for a subluminal (`|v|<c`) charge, so `|g'(tr)| = g'(tr)`.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral for `V(r, t)`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [f(tr) / g'(tr)]`\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [(q / |r - s(tr)|) / ((dc - d ⋅ v) / dc)]`\nUsing `d = |r - s(tr)|`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [(q / d) * (dc / (dc - d ⋅ v))]`\n`V(r, t) = (qc) / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n### 4. Vector Potential\n\nThe derivation for the vector potential `A(r, t)` is identical, except the numerator of the integrand contains an extra factor of `μ₀/4π` and the velocity vector `v(t')`.\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ q * v(t') / |r - s(t')| * δ(t' - (t - |r - s(t')|/c)) dt'`\nFollowing the same steps:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [(q * v(tr) / |r - s(tr)|) / g'(tr)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [(q * v / d) / ((dc - d ⋅ v) / dc)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe derived potentials are:\n*   Scalar Potential: `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n*   Vector Potential: `A(r, t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\nNow, we compare these results with the given options.\n\n*   A) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d⋅v))`, `A(r,t) = μqc v / (4π (dc + d⋅v))` - Incorrect sign in the denominator.\n*   B) `V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r)`, `A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)` - Incorrect formula for V (this is for a static charge) and incorrect relation between A and V.\n*   C) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d⋅v))`, `A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π (dc - d⋅v))` - **This matches our derived expressions perfectly.**\n*   D) `V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r)`, `A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)` - Incorrect formula for V. While the relation `A = (v/c²)V` is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials (as `A/V = (μ₀/4π) / (1/4πε₀c) * v = μ₀ε₀v = v/c²`), the expression for V is that of a static charge, which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>"
