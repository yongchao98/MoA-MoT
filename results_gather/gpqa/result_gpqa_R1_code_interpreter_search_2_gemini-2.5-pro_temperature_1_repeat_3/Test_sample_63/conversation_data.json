    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the gas treatment process to identify the decomposition products.**\n    1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂), which would form a precipitate (CaCO₃). The fact that the mass of this tube did not change means no CO₂ or other acidic gases (like SO₂, SO₃, NO₂) were produced. This implies the original salts do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n\n    3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, indicating a reaction with an oxygen-containing gas. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n        *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   This oxygen could have come from molecular oxygen (O₂) or another oxygen-containing gas like nitrous oxide (N₂O).\n            *   If it was O₂, the moles of O₂ would be 0.05 mol O / 2 = 0.025 mol. The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n            *   If it was N₂O, the moles of N₂O would be 0.05 mol, as there is one oxygen atom per N₂O molecule. The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n\n    4.  **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. Given that the elements must come from the original salts (which we deduced contain H, N, and O), this inert gas must be nitrogen (N₂).\n\n*   **Step 2: Summarize the decomposition products and deduce the identity of the salts.**\n    *   Total products from the decomposition are: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol of O atoms (in some form), and 0.10 mol N₂.\n    *   The elements present in the products are H, O, and N. Therefore, the salts A and B are composed of these three elements.\n    *   The most common salts containing only N, H, and O are ammonium salts of nitrogen's oxyacids: ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **Step 3: Test the hypothesis that the salts are ammonium nitrite (A) and ammonium nitrate (B).**\n    Let's assume the mixture contains `x` moles of salt A and `x` moles of salt B (equimolar mixture).\n\n    *   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite (A):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   `x` mol of NH₄NO₂ produces `x` mol of N₂ and `2x` mol of H₂O.\n\n    *   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (B):** This can proceed via two main pathways. Let's check both.\n        *   **Pathway 1:** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n            *   `x` mol of NH₄NO₃ produces `x` mol of N₂, 0.5`x` mol of O₂, and `2x` mol of H₂O.\n        *   **Pathway 2:** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n            *   `x` mol of NH₄NO₃ produces `x` mol of N₂O and `2x` mol of H₂O.\n\n    Let's combine the products and match them with our findings.\n\n    **Let's assume Pathway 1 for NH₄NO₃:**\n    *   Total H₂O = (from A) + (from B) = 2x + 2x = 4x.\n    *   Total O₂ = (from B) = 0.5x.\n    *   Total N₂ = (from A) + (from B) = x + x = 2x.\n\n    Now, let's use the experimental data to find `x`:\n    *   From H₂O: 4x = 0.20 mol  =>  **x = 0.05 mol**\n    *   From O₂: The 0.5x moles of O₂ react with Cu. This provides 2 * (0.5x) = x moles of O atoms. We know moles of O = 0.05. So, **x = 0.05 mol**.\n    *   From N₂: Total N₂ = 2x. We expect 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol of N₂. This matches the 0.10 mol of Gas C.\n    *   All calculations yield x = 0.05 mol, so this reaction scheme is consistent.\n\n    **(Self-check with Pathway 2 for NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Total H₂O = 2x + 2x = 4x. From data, 4x = 0.20 => x = 0.05 mol.\n    *   N₂O from B = x mol. This reacts with Cu: x N₂O + x Cu → x N₂ + x CuO. The mass gain is from x mol of O atoms. From data, moles of O = 0.05. So, x = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total N₂ (Gas C) = N₂ from A + N₂ from N₂O reduction = x + x = 2x. We expect 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. This matches.\n    *   Both pathways are consistent with the experimental data. In either case, the salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃, and there are 0.05 moles of each.\n\n*   **Step 4: Verify the total mass of the initial mixture.**\n    *   Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n        *   Molar Mass = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol\n        *   Mass = 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol = 3.20 g\n    *   Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n        *   Molar Mass = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol\n        *   Mass = 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol = 4.00 g\n    *   Total Mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given total mass.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms in the formulas of salts A and B.**\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = 8 (in salt A) + 9 (in salt B) = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
