    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene. Dehydration leads to an anhydride. The NMR data provided (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   The two vinyl protons are equivalent by symmetry, giving a single ¹H peak. The downfield shift (7 ppm) is due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n        *   The two alkene carbons are equivalent (peak at 137 ppm) and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent (peak at 165 ppm), matching the ¹³C data.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic, conjugated diene.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition. This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products**\n    *   The reaction between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride will form a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton with an anhydride ring fused to it and four methyl groups.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the sum of the reactants (C₉H₁₄ for the diene and C₄H₂O₃ for the anhydride).\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n        *   The **endo product** is formed through a transition state where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented under the diene's π-system. This is the **kinetically favored product** due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. Unless high temperatures are used to allow the reaction to equilibrate, this will be the **major product**.\n        *   The **exo product** is sterically less hindered and is the **thermodynamically favored product**. This will be the **minor product** under standard kinetic control.\n    *   In the context of the resulting bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene product, the stereochemical descriptors are defined relative to the C7 (methylene) bridge. A substituent is *exo* if it points towards the C7 bridge and *endo* if it points away.\n    *   The kinetic (major) product, formed via the *endo* transition state, results in a structure where the anhydride ring is pointed away from the C7 bridge. This means the two protons on the anhydride part of the ring (let's call them H_anhydride) are in the **exo position** (pointing towards the C7 bridge).\n    *   The thermodynamic (minor) product has the H_anhydride protons in the **endo position** (pointing away from the C7 bridge).\n\n3.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n    *   The product molecule has a C₂ axis of symmetry. We need to assign the signals mentioned in the options based on the expected chemical shifts and integrations.\n    *   **Protons on the anhydride ring (H_anhydride):** These are two equivalent methine protons (on C5 and C6 of the bicyclic system), adjacent to carbonyl groups. They are expected to be downfield. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the clear assignment for these protons.\n    *   **Methyl groups:** There are two types of methyl groups.\n        *   Two equivalent methyl groups are attached to the double bond (C2, C3). These are vinyl methyls. A chemical shift of ~1.7 ppm is typical. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   Two equivalent methyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). These are attached to saturated carbons. They will be more shielded. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n    *   **Methylene bridge protons (H_bridge):** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the double bond, one is *anti*). They split each other, forming an AB quartet (which often looks like two doublets). The *anti* proton is more shielded. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** is a very good fit for this *anti* bridge proton.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Cross-Peak**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows correlations between protons that are close in space (< 5Å).\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that is unique to the major isomer.\n    *   **Major Product (H_anhydride are *exo*):** In this isomer, the H_anhydride protons point towards the C7 bridge. Therefore, a strong Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) is expected between the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) and the **H_bridge** protons (e.g., the *anti* proton at ~1.5 ppm).\n    *   **Minor Product (H_anhydride are *endo*):** In this isomer, the H_anhydride protons point away from the C7 bridge and \"under\" the C2=C3 double bond. They are far from the C7 bridge protons. However, they are now very close to the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). So, an NOE would be expected between H_anhydride and the vinyl methyls in the minor product.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   The distinguishing NOE for the **major product** is between H_anhydride and H_bridge.\n    *   Let's match this with the options using our signal assignments:\n        *   Interaction: H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm) <--> H_bridge (~1.5 ppm).\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl Me) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride):** This interaction is characteristic of the **minor** product.\n    *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride):** This interaction is characteristic of the **major** product.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl Me):** These groups are on adjacent carbons and would show an NOE in **both** isomers.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge):** These groups would show an NOE in **both** isomers.\n\nConclusion: The cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product connects the resonances of the H_anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
