    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the number of atoms and the types of bonds. The chemical formula is given as `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\nLet's break down the structure and count the carbon and hydrogen atoms:\n*   `(CH3)2C=`: 1 central Carbon, 2 methyl groups (2 C, 6 H). Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n*   `=CH-`: 1 C, 1 H.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 C, 2 H.\n*   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 C in the chain, 1 methyl group (1 C, 3 H). Total: 2 C, 4 H.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 C, 2 H.\n*   `-CH=`: 1 C, 1 H.\n*   `=C(CH3)2`: 1 central Carbon, 2 methyl groups (2 C, 6 H). Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   **Total Carbon (C) atoms:** 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nNow, we count the bonds within the molecule:\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated by `=`: `(CH3)2C=CH-` and `-CH=C(CH3)2`. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:**\n    *   In `(CH3)2C=`: 2 C-C bonds (from the central C to the two methyl groups).\n    *   `=CH-CH2-`: 1 C-C bond.\n    *   `-CH2-CH(CH3)-`: 1 C-C bond.\n    *   In `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 C-C bond (from the chain C to the methyl group C).\n    *   `-CH(CH3)-CH2-`: 1 C-C bond.\n    *   `-CH2-CH=`: 1 C-C bond.\n    *   In `=C(CH3)2`: 2 C-C bonds (from the central C to the two methyl groups).\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom, compound)**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. It is the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in the molecule.\n\nGiven bond energies:\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom, compound = (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\nΔH_atom, compound = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\nΔH_atom, compound = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements (ΔH_atom, elements)**\n\nThis is the enthalpy change to form the constituent gaseous atoms (12 C(g) and 22 H(g)) from the elements in their standard states (12 C(graphite) and 11 H2(g)).\n\nThe reaction is: `12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) -> 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)`\n\nGiven data:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon (C(s) -> C(g)) = 1000 kJ/mol.\n*   Bond energy of H-H (H2(g) -> 2H(g)) = 100 kJ/mol.\n\nΔH_atom, elements = (12 × ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\nΔH_atom, elements = (12 × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 × 100 kJ/mol)\nΔH_atom, elements = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) is calculated using the following relationship:\nΔH_f = ΔH_atom, elements - ΔH_atom, compound\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔH_f = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Convert to the Required Units (kJ/g)**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/g, so we need to convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g. To do this, we need the molar mass of the compound C12H22.\n\n*   Molar mass of Carbon (C) ≈ 12 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol\nΔH_f (kJ/g) ≈ **11.4457... kJ/g**\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives **11.45 kJ/g**.

So, **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure shows two double bonds: `C=C`. So, **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** Let's trace the carbon backbone and side chains.\n        *   (CH3)2C-: 2 C-C bonds\n        *   -C=C-C-: 1 C-C bond\n        *   -C-C(CH3)-: 1 C-C bond in the chain + 1 C-C bond to the methyl group = 2 C-C bonds\n        *   -C-C-C=: 1 C-C bond\n        *   =C(CH3)2: 2 C-C bonds\n        *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = **8 C-C bonds**.\n        *   Let's re-verify this. A common way is: Total C-C bonds = (Total C atoms) - 1 + (rings). No rings. So, 12 - 1 = 11. This simple formula works for alkanes, but not for alkenes. Let's draw it out to be certain.\n        *   `C-C(=C)-C-C(C)-C-C(=C)-C` (This is the backbone and methyl carbons)\n        *   Let's count connections:\n            1.

My first count was correct. Let me re-do the addition: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 (to methyl) + 1 (in chain) + 1 + 2 = 9.

Deconstruct the Chemical Formula and Find the Molecular Formula**\n\nThe given molecule is `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\n*   Let's count the number of Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H) atoms to determine the molecular formula.\n    *   `(CH3)2C=`: 1 C in the chain + 2 C in methyl groups = 3 C. 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n    *   `=CH-`: 1 C, 1 H.\n    *   `-CH2-`: 1 C, 2 H.\n    *   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 C in the chain + 1 C in a methyl group = 2 C. 1 + 3 = 4 H.\n    *   `-CH2-`: 1 C, 2 H.\n    *   `-CH=`: 1 C, 1 H.\n    *   `=C(CH3)2`: 1 C in the chain + 2 C in methyl groups = 3 C. 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n*   **Total Carbon atoms:** 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12 C**\n*   **Total Hydrogen atoms:** 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 H**\n*   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Bonds of Each Type**\n\nTo calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, we need to sum the bond energies of all the bonds being broken.\n\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds (`=`). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** We need to count all the single bonds between carbon atoms.\n    *   Two C-C bonds connecting the two `CH3` groups to the first carbon.\n    *   One C-C bond between `=CH-` and `-CH2-`.\n    *   One C-C bond between `-CH2-` and `-CH(CH3)-`.\n    *   One C-C bond connecting the `CH3` group to the main chain in `-CH(CH3)-`.\n    *   One C-C bond between `-CH(CH3)-` and `-CH2-`.\n    *   One C-C bond between `-CH2-` and `-CH=`.\n    *   Two C-C bonds connecting the two `CH3` groups to the last carbon.\n    *   **Total C-C bonds:** 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3.
