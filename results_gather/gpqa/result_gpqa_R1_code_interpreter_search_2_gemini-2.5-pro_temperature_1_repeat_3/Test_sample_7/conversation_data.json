As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nC) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of Gene G2:**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` shows a complete loss of resistance (0%). This is the most severe phenotype possible, suggesting G2 plays a critical and essential role in the resistance pathway.\n    *   The double mutants `g1g2` and `g2g3` also show 0% resistance. The phenotype of the `g2` mutation completely masks the phenotypes of the `g1` and `g3` mutations.\n    *   This phenomenon, where one gene's mutation masks the effect of another, is called **epistasis**. Specifically, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.\n    *   The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of others. A TF that activates other resistance genes is a perfect explanation for this observation. If the master switch (the TF) is off, it doesn't matter what state the downstream genes are in; the pathway is broken.\n    *   Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that **G2 is a transcription factor** that regulates G1 and/or G3 (and possibly other genes).\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between Gene G1 and Gene G3:**\n    *   The single mutants `g1` (75% resistance) and `g3` (50% resistance) both show a partial loss of resistance. This means both gene products contribute to the final resistance level.\n    *   The double mutant `g1g3` shows only 10% resistance. This phenotype is much more severe than either of the single mutant phenotypes.\n    *   If the genes acted in completely separate pathways, the expected combined effect would be multiplicative (0.75 * 0.50 = 0.375 or 37.5% resistance). The observed 10% is much lower.\n    *   If they were in a simple linear pathway (e.g., G1 -> G3), the upstream mutant's phenotype would be epistatic. For example, the `g1g3` phenotype would be the same as the `g1` phenotype. This is not the case (10% is not 75%).\n    *   The fact that losing both genes has a much stronger effect than losing one (a synergistic effect) indicates that the two genes have overlapping or complementary functions. This is known as **gene redundancy**. They both contribute to the same overall process (resistance), likely in parallel pathways activated by G2.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. This experiment only measures one trait (resistance), so we cannot conclude this.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct. This is the best description of their synergistic interaction.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This statement is incorrect based on the classic definition of epistasis, as shown above. However, the first two statements in this option are strongly supported by the data. Among all choices, this option provides the most accurate description of the genetic network.\n\n    *   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect. G2 is the upstream regulator.\n        *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: This part is true, but the primary premise of the option is wrong.\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n        *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a possible molecular mechanism, but it cannot be concluded from this phenotypic data. They could have different promoters that are both activated by G2.\n        *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption B contains the two most accurate conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment: G2 is the upstream transcription factor, and G1 and G3 function with redundancy. Despite the inaccuracy of its third clause, it is the best-fitting answer among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
