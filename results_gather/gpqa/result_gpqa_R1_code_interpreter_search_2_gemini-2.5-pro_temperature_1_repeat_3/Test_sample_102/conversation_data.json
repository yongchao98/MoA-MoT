    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone, which is a benzene ring attached to an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   We number the ring starting from the point of attachment of the acetyl group as position 1.\n*   There is a bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n*   There is a nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nThe structure is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are:\n*   -COCH3 (acetyl group) at C1\n*   -Br (bromo group) at C3\n*   -NO2 (nitro group) at C5\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nTo plan the synthesis, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl)**: This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo)**: This is a deactivating group but an **ortho-, para-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\nThe goal is to introduce these three groups onto the benzene ring in an order that uses their directing effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option provided:\n\n**Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...\n*   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene. The -NO2 group is a meta-director.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline. The -NH2 group is a strongly activating ortho-, para-director.\n*   iii) Aniline -> ? (CH3COCl/AlCl3). This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails on aniline because the amino group (-NH2) is a strong Lewis base that reacts irreversibly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring and preventing the acylation. This sequence has a fatal flaw at step (iii).\n\n**Option B:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...\n*   i) Benzene -> Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an ortho-, para-director.\n*   ii) Bromobenzene -> p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product) and o-Bromonitrobenzene.\n*   iii) p-Bromonitrobenzene -> ? (CH3COCl/AlCl3). This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The benzene ring is substituted with two deactivating groups (-Br and -NO2), making it strongly deactivated. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings. This sequence has a fatal flaw at step (iii).\n\n**Option D:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2 ; ...\n*   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline\n*   iii) Aniline -> Benzenediazonium chloride\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride -> Benzene (deamination reaction).\n*   These first four steps start with benzene and end with benzene, making the sequence illogical and inefficient. If we consider the remaining steps starting from benzene:\n    *   v) Benzene -> Bromobenzene (-Br is o,p-director)\n    *   vi) Bromobenzene -> p-Bromoacetophenone (major product, acylation occurs para to Br).\n    *   vii) p-Bromoacetophenone -> ? (Nitration). In p-bromoacetophenone, the -Br is at C1 (o,p-director) and -COCH3 is at C4 (m-director). Both groups direct substitution to the positions ortho to the bromine (C2, C6) and meta to the acetyl group. Thus, nitration would yield 4-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone, which is not the target molecule. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...\n*   **i) Benzene -> Acetophenone** (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). This is a standard reaction. The product, acetophenone, has an acetyl group (-COCH3) which is a **meta-director**.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone -> 3-Bromoacetophenone** (Bromination). Since the -COCH3 group is a meta-director, the incoming electrophile (Br+) will add to the meta position (C3). This step correctly produces 3-bromoacetophenone.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** (Nitration). Now the ring has two substituents: -COCH3 at C1 (meta-director) and -Br at C3 (ortho-, para-director). This is a case of competing directing effects.\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group to C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   However, substitution at any position ortho or para to the bromine (C2, C4, C6) would require forming a carbocation intermediate (sigma complex) where one of the resonance structures places the positive charge on C1, the carbon attached to the strongly electron-withdrawing acetyl group. This is a very high-energy, unstable intermediate.\n    *   Substitution at C5 (meta to both groups) avoids this highly unstable intermediate. The positive charge is distributed to C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction proceeds to place the nitro group at position C5, yielding the desired product: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence C provide a viable, high-yield route to the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and would modify the product, but the question asks for a sequence that would *lead to* the synthesis. Among the choices, only option C contains a chemically sound pathway to the desired product. The other options contain steps that are either impossible or lead to the wrong isomer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
