    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B and the heavy isotope.**\nThe problem states that a precipitate G, when heated, releases substance B, which has a melting point very close to 277 K.\n*   277 Kelvin is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   This temperature is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   This strongly suggests that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n*   This also reveals the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the first clue: it is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**, an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W.**\nSubstance X reacts with liquid Y to release gas W, whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Let's check potential simple gases. Deuterium gas (D₂) consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits the description perfectly.\n*   The production of D₂ gas is consistent with a reaction involving a deuterated reagent.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X.**\nWe have several clues about Substance X:\n*   It contains Deuterium (D).\n*   It's a reagent used in organic chemistry, and it has a \"very close analog\" (which would be the version with normal hydrogen, ¹H).\n*   It reacts violently with a liquid Y.\n*   The reaction with a keto acid (which contains at least 3 oxygen atoms, e.g., R-C(=O)-COOH) results in a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates a very strong reduction, where both the ketone group (-C=O) and the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) are reduced to alcohol groups (-CH-OH and -CH₂-OH, respectively). For example: R-C(=O)-COOH → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH. The product is a diol with 2 oxygens.\n\nLet's consider common reducing agents in organic chemistry.\n*   Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a common reducing agent, but it is relatively mild and would typically only reduce the ketone group, not the carboxylic acid. Its deuterated version, NaBD₄, would not fit the keto acid clue.\n*   **Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄)** is a very powerful reducing agent, capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids. It is known to react violently with water. Its deuterated analog is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   Let's test LiAlD₄ against all clues:\n    *   **Contains heavy isotope:** Yes, it contains Deuterium.\n    *   **Organic chemistry reagent with analog:** Yes, LiAlD₄ is the deuterated analog of the very common reagent LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Reduces keto acid to a 2-oxygen product:** Yes, its high reactivity achieves this.\n    *   **Reacts violently:** Yes. Let's assume Y is D₂O (heavy water), analogous to the violent reaction of LiAlH₄ with H₂O. The reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   **Products:** This reaction produces D₂ gas (which is our Gas W) and a precipitate of lithium deuteroxide and aluminum deuteroxide (our precipitate G). Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, when heated, decomposes to Al₂O₃ and D₂O (our substance B).\n\nAll clues point consistently to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Calculation.**\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation, which is standard for this type of problem.\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Constituent Elements (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (H).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Al).\n\nThe question requires us to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements as they appear in the formula.\n\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The formula contains 4 atoms of the hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   Total mass from hydrogen = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The formula contains 1 atom of Aluminum. The most stable and common isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number of Aluminum is 27.\n    *   Total mass from aluminum = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n*   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** Sum the two calculated masses.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
