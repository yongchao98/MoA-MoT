    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame of reference. It is considered stationary.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference in which the glass is at rest. This frame is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame (S).\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the glass relative to the lab (v):** The problem states the glass is moving at a constant velocity `v` in the same direction as the beam.\n    *   **Velocity of light in the glass frame (u'):** This is the speed of light as measured by an observer at rest with the glass. The refractive index `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass is `c/n`. The problem specifies that we should take `c=1`. So, `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **Velocity of light in the lab frame (u):** This is the quantity we need to find â€“ the speed of light in the moving glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    Since the problem involves the speed of light, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula (also known as Einstein's velocity addition formula), not the classical Galilean formula. The formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object in frame S.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object in frame S'.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of frame S' relative to frame S.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    We substitute our identified values (`u' = 1/n`, `v = v`, and `c = 1`) into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    First, simplify the denominator:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\n    Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated speed of light relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
