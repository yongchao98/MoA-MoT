    "*   **1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n    *   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n        *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n        *   Moles = 0.500 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n    *   **Moles of HCl (strong acid):**\n        *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n        *   HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates. Moles of H+ = Moles of HCl.\n        *   Moles of H+ = 0.400 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n    *   **Moles of Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n        *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n        *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates into Ba2+ and 2 OH-.\n        *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n        *   Moles of OH- = 2 * 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n*   **2. Neutralization Reactions.**\n    The strong acid (H+) and strong base (OH-) will react first in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   H+ + OH- → H2O\n    *   Initial moles H+ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH- = 0.180 mol\n    *   Since there are more moles of OH- than H+, all the H+ will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n    Now, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH- = 0.100 mol\n    *   Since there are more moles of OH- than CH3COOH, all the CH3COOH will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **3. Calculate the final concentration of OH- and the pH.**\n    The final solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of OH- ions. This excess of a strong base will determine the pH of the solution.\n    *   **Total Volume of the solution:**\n        *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n    *   **Concentration of OH-:**\n        *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n        *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n    *   **Calculate pOH:**\n        *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n        *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   **Calculate pH:**\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH\n        *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
