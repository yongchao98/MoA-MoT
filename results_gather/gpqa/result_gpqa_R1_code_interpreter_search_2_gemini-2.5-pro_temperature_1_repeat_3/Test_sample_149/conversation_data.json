    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from the given molecular formula (C8H9NO) and ¹H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The formula for DBE is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 units of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring.\n\n*   **Analyze the ¹H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2), meaning it is next to a -CH2- group. This confirms the fragment -CH2-CHO.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde. It appears as a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This further confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons and appearing as a doublet, are classic for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to the aromatic ring. The broadness is due to nitrogen's quadrupolar moment and proton exchange.\n\n*   **Assemble the Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (-CH2-CHO, -NH2, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring), we can assemble the structure. The two substituents are placed at the para positions (1 and 4) on the benzene ring.\n    The resulting structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify its molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 (amine) = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This reagent mixture is used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N2+Cl-.\n    *   Product (Intermediate I): 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to an aryl diazonium salt (often with gentle heating) results in the replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Nitrogen gas (N2) is evolved.\n    *   Product (Intermediate II): **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This intermediate is an aldehyde with acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    The reaction proceeds in two stages: aldol addition, followed by dehydration (condensation).\n\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** One molecule of the aldehyde is deprotonated by KOH to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        *   Let Ar = 4-hydroxyphenyl (HO-C6H4-). The aldehyde is Ar-CH2-CHO.\n        *   The addition product is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option A).\n            ```\n                  OH\n                  |\n            Ar-CH2-CH--CH(Ar)-CHO\n            ```\n\n    2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**, which provides the energy to eliminate a molecule of water from the aldol addition product. The proton on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl (C2) is acidic and is removed by the base. The -OH group on the β-carbon (C3) is then eliminated, forming a double bond between C2 and C3.\n        *   This elimination is highly favored because the resulting α,β-unsaturated aldehyde is a very stable conjugated system (the C=C double bond is conjugated with both the aldehyde's C=O and the aromatic ring on C2).\n\n    *   **Final Product:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n        ```\n             Ar-CH2-CH=C(Ar)-CHO\n        ```\n        This structure corresponds to option D.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sequence of reactions transforms 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-condensation under heat and basic conditions to yield the final α,β-unsaturated aldehyde product.\n\n*   Starting Material: 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n*   After steps 1 & 2: 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde\n*   After step 3 (aldol condensation): **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate addition product, not the final product under heat.\nB) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure.\nC) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure (missing -OH groups).\nD) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This matches our derived final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
