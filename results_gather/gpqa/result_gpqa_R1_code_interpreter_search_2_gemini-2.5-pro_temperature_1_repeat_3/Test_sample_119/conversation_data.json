    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Setup:**\n    *   We assume stars are uniformly distributed in three-dimensional space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere.\n    *   The number of stars (`N`) in any given volume (`V`) is therefore `N = ρ * V`.\n\n2.  **Relate Number of Stars to Distance:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars (`dN`) within a thin spherical shell centered on the observer (Earth/Sun).\n    *   Let the shell have an inner radius `d` and an outer radius `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars `dN` in this shell is the density `ρ` times the volume `dV`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    *   This equation tells us that the number of stars in a thin shell of constant thickness `dd` increases as the square of the distance (`d²`).\n\n3.  **Introduce Parallax:**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`d`). The standard formula is `plx = 1/d` (where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n    *   We can rewrite the distance as a function of parallax: `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Connect the Differentials:**\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*, which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   We have an expression for `dN` in terms of `dd`. We need to relate the distance interval `dd` to the parallax interval `d(plx)`. We can do this using calculus.\n    *   Starting with `d = 1/plx = (plx)⁻¹`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1 * (plx)⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   This means `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`. The negative sign just indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When considering the number of stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can say the size of the distance interval `dd` corresponding to a parallax interval `d(plx)` is `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n5.  **Derive the Final Relationship:**\n    *   We can use the chain rule to find `dN/d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (dN/dd) * (dd/d(plx))`\n    *   From step 2, we know `dN/dd = ρ * 4πd²`.\n    *   From step 4, we know `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`.\n    *   Substituting these into the chain rule equation:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (ρ * 4πd²) * (-1/plx²) `\n    *   Now, we must express everything in terms of `plx`. Substitute `d = 1/plx` into the equation:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (ρ * 4π * (1/plx)²) * (-1/plx²) `\n        `dN/d(plx) = (ρ * 4π / plx²) * (-1/plx²) `\n        `dN/d(plx) = - (4πρ) / plx⁴ `\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`. The negative sign is not relevant for the proportionality, it just reflects the inverse relationship between the quantities.\n\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as the inverse fourth power of the parallax. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
