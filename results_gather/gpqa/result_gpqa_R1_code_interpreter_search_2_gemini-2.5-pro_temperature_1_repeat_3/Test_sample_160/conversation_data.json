    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Define λ1 (Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules):**\n    *   λ1 is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules within the vacuum chamber *before* the electron beam is turned on.\n    *   This path describes the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another *gas molecule*.\n    *   The standard formula for the mean free path of a molecule in a gas of identical molecules, from the kinetic theory of gases, is:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    *   Where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n        *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. This is typically taken as σ_gg = πd², where 'd' is the effective diameter of the molecule.\n        *   The `√2` factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also moving, not stationary. It arises from averaging over the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities for both the projectile and target molecules.\n\n2.  **Define λ2 (Mean Free Path of Electrons):**\n    *   λ2 is the mean free path observed *after* the electron beam is initiated. The problem states this path is based on *electron scattering with gas molecules*.\n    *   Therefore, λ2 is the average distance an *electron* from the beam travels before it scatters off a gas molecule.\n    *   The formula for the mean free path of a beam of particles moving through a gas of effectively stationary targets is:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   Where:\n        *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n        *   **Crucially, the `√2` factor is absent.** This is because the electrons are accelerated to very high energies (1000 keV), making their velocity vastly greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. From the perspective of the fast-moving electron, the gas molecules are essentially stationary targets.\n\n3.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   To compare λ1 and λ2, we can take their ratio:\n        λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n        λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n        λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\n4.  **Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    *   **σ_gg (gas-gas):** This is the kinetic cross-section, effectively the target area one molecule presents to another. It's proportional to the square of the molecular diameter (σ_gg = πd²).\n    *   **σ_eg (electron-gas):** This is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron hitting a molecule. Since an electron is, for practical purposes, a point particle (its physical radius is negligible compared to a molecule's), the classical geometric cross-section would be determined by the radius of the molecule (r = d/2). This gives σ_eg ≈ πr² = π(d/2)² = πd²/4. So, σ_eg is roughly 1/4 of σ_gg.\n    *   This means the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is approximately 4.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio λ2 / λ1:**\n    *   Plugging the ratio of the cross-sections back into our equation:\n        λ2 / λ1 ≈ √2 * 4\n    *   Since √2 ≈ 1.414, the ratio is:\n        λ2 / λ1 ≈ 1.414 * 4 = 5.656\n    *   This calculation shows that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1, by a factor of approximately 5.66.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   The physical analysis robustly concludes that λ2 > λ1. Let's see which option fits.\n    *   Our calculated ratio is λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1.\n    *   A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This is true, as 5.66 is much greater than 1.22.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: This is false.\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1: This is false.\n    *   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is false. Even a very conservative estimate, where we assume the cross-sections are equal (σ_gg = σ_eg), would yield λ2 / λ1 = √2 ≈ 1.414. This value is still greater than 1.22.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mean free path for an electron in the gas (λ2) is longer than the mean free path for a gas molecule in the same gas (λ1) for two main reasons:\n1.  The high velocity of the electrons means the target gas molecules are effectively stationary, removing the `√2` factor that shortens λ1. This alone makes λ2 larger by a factor of ~1.414.\n2.  The effective collision cross-section for a point-like electron hitting a molecule (σ_eg) is smaller than that for a molecule hitting another molecule (σ_gg). This further increases the ratio of λ2 to λ1.\n\nBoth effects lead to λ2 being significantly larger than λ1. Option A is the only one that reflects this physical reality.\n\n<<<A>>>"
