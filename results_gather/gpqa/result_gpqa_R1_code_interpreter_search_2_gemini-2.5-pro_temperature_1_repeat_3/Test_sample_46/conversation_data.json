    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is `C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`.\n    *   DBE = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds).\n    *   The remaining degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) is likely due to a double bond, such as a carbonyl group (C=O). This suggests the structure contains a substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This rules out any structure with a secondary amine (-NH-), tertiary amine (-N<), or a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an **ester conjugated with an aromatic ring**. A simple alkyl ester is usually around 1735-1750 cm⁻¹, but conjugation lowers the frequency. An amide C=O would typically be at a lower frequency (1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring are different, causing the protons on the ring to split into two distinct sets. The downfield shift of the doublet at 8.0 ppm indicates it is adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl), while the upfield shift of the doublet at 7.0 ppm indicates it is adjacent to an electron-donating group (like an amine).\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A triplet (3H) coupled to a quartet (2H) is the signature pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is very significant. A methylene (-CH₂-) group at such a downfield position must be attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an **ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. If it were adjacent to a carbonyl group (e.g., in a propyl ketone), its shift would be around 2.5 ppm.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to nitrogen's quadrupole moment and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options\n\nBased on the analysis, the molecule has the following components:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nLet's combine these pieces. The two substituents, -NH₂ (electron-donating) and -COOCH₂CH₃ (electron-withdrawing), are attached to the benzene ring at the 1 and 4 positions. This gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options provided:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure (also known as Benzocaine) perfectly matches all the data: C9H11NO2 formula, para-disubstituted ring, primary amine, and an ethyl ester group.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which contradicts the NMR aromatic pattern. It is also a primary amide, and the IR C=O frequency is a better fit for an ester.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the acid portion (propionate). The NMR signal for the -CH₂- group in -CO-CH₂-CH₃ would be at ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. It also lacks the 2H broad singlet for an -NH₂ group in the NMR.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll evidence points conclusively to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate as the correct compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
