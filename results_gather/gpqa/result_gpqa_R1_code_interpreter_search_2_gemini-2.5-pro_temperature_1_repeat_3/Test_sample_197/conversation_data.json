    "This problem requires us to calculate the distribution of cobalt(II) species in a solution containing thiocyanate ions. The percentage of a specific complex, in this case, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)2]`, can be determined using the overall stability constants (β) and the concentration of the free ligand (`SCN-`).\n\n**1. Define the System**\n\nThe various cobalt-containing species in equilibrium in the solution are:\n*   Free aquated Co(II) ion: `[Co(H2O)6]2+` (denoted as `Co^2+`)\n*   Monothiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)]+`\n*   Dithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)2]`\n*   Trithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)3]-`\n*   Tetrathiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by the following equilibria and their overall stability constants (β):\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)]+` ; `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]+] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]) = 9`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2 SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)2]` ; `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^2) = 40`\n*   `Co^2+ + 3 SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)3]-` ; `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^3) = 63`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4 SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)4]2-` ; `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^4) = 16`\n\n**2. Formulate the Distribution Coefficient (α)**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]2-]`\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of `[Co^2+]`, `[SCN-]`, and the stability constants:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4`\n\nFactoring out `[Co^2+]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nThe fraction (or distribution coefficient, `α_n`) of any given species `[Co(SCN)n]` is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. We are interested in `α_2` for `[Co(SCN)2]`:\n`α_2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n`α_2 = (β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` terms cancel out, leaving:\n`α_2 = (β2[SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n**3. Approximate and Calculate**\n\nThe total concentration of the ligand (`[SCN-] = 0.1 M`) is ten times greater than the total concentration of the metal ion (`c(Co) = 10^-2 M = 0.01 M`). In such cases, it's a common and reasonable approximation to assume that the concentration of the free ligand `[SCN-]` is equal to its total initial concentration, as the amount consumed in complex formation is relatively small.\nTherefore, we use `[SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the equation for `α_2`.\n\n*   Numerator = `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   Denominator = `1 + (β1 * [SCN-]) + (β2 * [SCN-]^2) + (β3 * [SCN-]^3) + (β4 * [SCN-]^4)`\n    *   `β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n    *   `β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n    *   `β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n*   Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n`α_2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo find the percentage, we multiply the fraction `α_2` by 100:\nPercentage of `[Co(SCN)2]` = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis value corresponds to option C.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, we can use a simple script.\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The numerator for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex\nnumerator = beta2 * scn_conc**2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of the relative concentrations of all species\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The percentage of [Co(SCN)2] is: {percentage}%\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a chemistry problem involving complex ion equilibria.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total amount of cobalt in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify Given Information:**\n*   Total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M\n*   Thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN-]` = 0.1 M\n*   Overall stability constants:\n    *   `β₁` for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` = 9\n    *   `β₂` for `[Co(SCN)₂]` = 40\n    *   `β₃` for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` = 63\n    *   `β₄` for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` = 16\n\n**3. Formulate the Chemical Equilibria:**\nThe species in solution are `Co²⁺`, `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`.\nThe total cobalt concentration is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**4. Express Concentrations using Stability Constants:**\nThe definition of the overall stability constant `β_n` is:\n`β_n = [[Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n)] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^n)`\nFrom this, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**5. Develop the Expression for the Total Concentration:**\nSubstitute these expressions back into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\nFactor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**6. Define the Fraction of the Target Species:**\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is `([[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)) * 100%`.\nThe fraction, `α₂`, is:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\nSubstitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` and `c(Co)`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n**7. Simplify the Fraction:**\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out from the numerator and denominator:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**8. Consider the Ligand Concentration:**\nThe total ligand concentration `c(SCN)` is 0.1 M, and the total metal concentration `c(Co)` is 0.01 M. Since the ligand is in significant excess (10-fold), the amount of ligand bound to the metal will be small compared to the total amount of ligand. Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` as being equal to the initial total concentration.\n`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n**9. Perform the Calculation:**\nNow, substitute the numerical values into the simplified fraction formula.\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the denominator first:\n*   `1`\n*   `β₁[SCN⁻]` = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nDenominator `D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate the numerator:\n*   Numerator `N = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`\n\nNow, calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = N / D = 0.4 / 2.3646`\n\nLet's do the division: `0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**10. Convert to Percentage:**\nPercentage = `α₂ * 100 = 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%`\n\n**11. Compare with Options:**\nA) 42.3%\nB) 25.6%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.916% is very close to 16.9%.\n\n**12. Final Check:**\nThe reasoning is sound. The concept of distribution coefficients (alpha fractions) is standard for complex equilibria. The approximation for the free ligand concentration is justified due to the excess of ligand. The calculation is straightforward substitution. The Python code generated in the first step also confirms this calculation and result. The code execution output shows `16.916180326482287%`, which matches the manual calculation. Therefore, the answer is C. The user wants to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, in a solution with a total cobalt concentration of `10^-2 M` and a thiocyanate concentration of `0.1 M`.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Equilibria**\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`) to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free Co(II) ions and all the cobalt-thiocyanate complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-]`\n\nThe formation of these complexes is governed by their overall stability constants (β):\n*   `[Co(SCN)^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n*   `[Co(SCN)3^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n*   `[Co(SCN)4^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n**2. Formulate the Fraction of the Desired Complex**\nWe want to find the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)2]` species. The fraction of this species, denoted as `α2`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n`α2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions from step 1 into the equation for `c(Co)`, we get:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4`\n\nWe can factor out `[Co^2+]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nNow, we can express the fraction `α2`:\n`α2 = (β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, simplifying the expression for `α2`:\n`α2 = (β2[SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n**3. Substitute the Given Values and Calculate**\nWe are given:\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n\nNote: Since the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is 10 times the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]` to be equal to its total initial concentration, 0.1 M.\n\nNow, we calculate the terms for the formula:\n*   **Numerator:** `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator:**\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n    *   `β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n    *   `β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n*   **Sum of Denominator:** `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate the fraction `α2`:\n`α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
