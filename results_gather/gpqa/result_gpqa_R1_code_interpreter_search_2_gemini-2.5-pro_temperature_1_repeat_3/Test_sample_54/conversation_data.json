    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the total number of protons and rule out possibilities.**\n\n*   Let's sum the integration values from the 1H NMR data: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n*   Now, let's count the protons in the possible structures:\n    *   **Propenyl acetate** (C5H8O2): CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃ has 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8 protons.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate** (C6H10O2): CH₃-CH₂-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃ has 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 10 protons.\n\nThe total proton count of 8 matches propenyl acetate. Therefore, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and D). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Assign the individual signals.**\n\nThe structure is CH₃(a)-C(=O)-O-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH₃(d).\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** Indicates this methyl group has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is the acetate methyl group, CH₃(a). This signal is present in both cis and trans isomers.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** Indicates this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This corresponds to the allylic methyl group, CH₃(d), which is split by the vinyl proton H(c).\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** Indicates this proton is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three protons (giving the quartet). This signal must be for the vinyl proton H(c), which is coupled to H(b) (1H) and the methyl group CH₃(d) (3H).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** Indicates this proton is coupled to a single adjacent proton, which must be H(c). This signal is for H(b).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~7.0 ppm):** This proton is significantly downfield (deshielded) because it is on a carbon atom directly bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom of the ester group (-CH=CH-O-).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans).**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J value) between the two vinyl protons, H(b) and H(c).\n\n*   The signal for H(b) at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   The typical range for vicinal coupling constants (³J) across a double bond is:\n    *   **³J_trans ≈ 12-18 Hz**\n    *   **³J_cis ≈ 6-12 Hz**\n\nThe observed coupling constant of 16.0 Hz falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the proton count, the signal assignments, and particularly the large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
