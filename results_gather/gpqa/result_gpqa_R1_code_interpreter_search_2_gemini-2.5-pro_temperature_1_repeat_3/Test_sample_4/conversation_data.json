    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Quantum Mechanical Operators**\n\nThe problem provides the components of a vector operator $\\vec{P}$. Let's write them down.\n- $X$-component: $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- $Y$-component: $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- $Z$-component: $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThese are the spin angular momentum operators for a spin-1/2 particle (like a muon), where the matrices are the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$). So, $\\vec{P}$ is the spin operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$.\n\n**2. Define the Direction Vector**\n\nThe problem asks for the eigenvector along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane.\nIn spherical coordinates, a general unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is given by:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$\nFor a vector to be in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This means $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$. We assume a general direction, so $\\sin\\theta \\neq 0$ (unless it's along the z-axis, which is a specific case). Therefore, we must have $\\sin\\phi=0$, which implies the azimuthal angle $\\phi = 0$ (or $\\pi$). Let's choose the convention $\\phi=0$.\nThe unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is then:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n**3. Construct the Operator along the Direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y (0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta$\nCombining the matrices:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right]$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Set up and Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the constant $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis gives a system of two linear equations:\n1) $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n2) $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the ratio $b/a$:\n$b\\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nNow, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n- $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n- $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, we have the relationship $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\n\n**5. Determine the Normalized Eigenvector**\n\nThe eigenvector has the form $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a\\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWe can write this as $|\\psi\\rangle = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2)/\\cos(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\nTo remove the fraction, we can multiply by a constant, $\\cos(\\theta/2)$. Let the new eigenvector be represented by a constant $C$ times this simplified form:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we normalize the eigenvector. The norm squared must be 1: $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = \\left( C^* \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) & \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 1$\n$|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n$|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$\n\nWe can choose the simplest normalization constant, $C=1$.\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n- A) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect. Eigenvectors are state vectors and do not have units of $\\hbar$.\n- B) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect.\n- C) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2)) - **Correct.** This matches our derived result.\n- D) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect. The dependence is on $\\theta/2$, not $\\theta$. Also, for the x-z plane, $\\phi=0$, so the complex exponential would be 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
