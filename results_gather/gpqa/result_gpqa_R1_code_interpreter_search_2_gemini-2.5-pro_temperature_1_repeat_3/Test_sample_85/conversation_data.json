    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of **tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. This is the IUPAC name for a delta-lactone, which is a six-membered ring containing a cyclic ester. Let's break down the name:\n*   **Pyran**: A six-membered heterocycle with one oxygen atom.\n*   **Tetrahydro**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2. By convention for heterocycles, the oxygen atom is position 1. So, the ring structure is O(1)-C(=O)(2)-C(3)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to carbon 4 of the ring.\n*   **(R) or (S)**: This indicates the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is C4 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nThe product is therefore **4-ethyl-δ-valerolactone**.\n\nA lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. A six-membered lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid (if numbering from the COOH as C1) or a 6-hydroxy-carboxylic acid (if numbering from the OH as C1). Let's trace the carbon chain required to form our specific product.\nThe lactone ring `O(1)-C(=O)(2)-C(3)-C(4)(Et)-C(5)-C(6)` is formed from a linear hydroxy acid. The `O(1)` comes from a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the `C(=O)(2)` comes from a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\nTracing back from the lactone:\n*   The O(1) and C(6) came from a `-CH2OH` group.\n*   The C(2) came from a `-COOH` group.\n*   The chain connecting them is `-C(3)-C(4)(Et)-C(5)-`.\nSo the precursor hydroxy acid is: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`.\nLet's name this acid: Numbering from COOH as C1, we have `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5)`. This is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\nThe chiral center in this acid is C3, which corresponds to C4 in the resulting lactone.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reactions**\n\nThe proposed starting material in the options is **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\nLet's deduce its structure. The name suggests a pentanoic acid backbone with substituents.\n*   **Pentanoic acid**: `HOOC-C-C-C-C`.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group at C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: At C5, the terminal carbon is replaced by an isobutyl ester group `-C(=O)O-iBu`.\nSo the structure is `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)`.\nThis molecule is a mono-ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOR'). It also has a chiral center at C3, the same position as in our deduced hydroxy acid precursor.\n\nNow let's analyze the two reactions based on the known selectivity of the reducing agents.\n\n#### **Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reagent**: Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄).\n*   **Selectivity**: LiBH₄ is a moderately strong reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols more readily than it reduces carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction**: LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu` --(1. LiBH₄)--> `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` + `iBu-OH`\n    (after protonation during the H⁺ workup).\n*   **Lactonization**: The product of the reduction is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. As established in Step 1, this acid cyclizes (especially under acidic workup conditions) to form **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The reduction and cyclization reactions occur at C1 and C5 of the carbon chain. The chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, its stereochemical configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)-lactone**, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n#### **Reaction B: Reduction with BH₃**\n\n*   **Reagent**: Borane (BH₃), typically used as a BH₃·THF complex.\n*   **Selectivity**: BH₃ is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. It reduces carboxylic acids rapidly to primary alcohols, while esters react much more slowly.\n*   **Reaction**: BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu` --(1. BH₃, 2. H⁺ workup)--> `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`\n*   **Lactonization**: The product is **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**. This hydroxy-ester can undergo intramolecular transesterification (catalyzed by the acid workup or heat) to form the same six-membered lactone and release isobutanol (iBu-OH).\n    `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu` --(H⁺)--> **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one** + `iBu-OH`\n*   **Stereochemistry**: Again, the reactions occur at the ends of the carbon chain (C1 and C5), leaving the chiral center at C3 untouched. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)-lactone**, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **3. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be the **(R)** isomer.\n*   Starting material **B** must be the **(S)** isomer.\n\nThis corresponds to the following option:\nA = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n<<<C>>>"
