    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial State\nThe particle is a spin 1/2 particle. Its magnetic moment `μ` is given by the vector operator `μ⃗ = γS⃗`, where `S⃗` is the spin operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\nInitially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. The interaction energy is given by the Hamiltonian `H_initial = -μ⃗ ⋅ B⃗ = -γS_z B`.\nFor the magnetic moment to be aligned with the field, the energy must be at its minimum. This occurs when the expectation value of `S_z` is maximized (assuming `γ > 0`; if `γ < 0`, `S_z` would be minimized, but as we will see, this does not change the oscillation frequency). The maximum eigenvalue of `S_z` for a spin 1/2 particle is `+ħ/2`. The corresponding eigenstate is the spin-up state along the z-axis, denoted as `|+z⟩`.\nTherefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is:\n`|ψ(t=0)⟩ = |+z⟩`\n\n### 2. Identify the New Hamiltonian\nAt `t=0`, the magnetic field in the Z direction is turned off, and a new magnetic field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the +Y direction.\nThe new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0` is:\n`H = -μ⃗ ⋅ B⃗ = -γS_y B`\n\n### 3. Analyze the Time Evolution\nWe want to find the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is equivalent to finding the oscillation frequency of `⟨S_z(t)⟩`.\n\nWe can use the Heisenberg equation of motion for an operator `A`:\n`d⟨A⟩/dt = (i/ħ)⟨[H, A]⟩ + ⟨∂A/∂t⟩`\nSince `S_z` does not explicitly depend on time, the second term is zero.\n\nLet's calculate the time derivative of `⟨S_z⟩`:\n`d⟨S_z⟩/dt = (i/ħ)⟨[H, S_z]⟩ = (i/ħ)⟨[-γBS_y, S_z]⟩ = (-iγB/ħ)⟨[S_y, S_z]⟩`\n\nWe use the spin commutation relation `[S_i, S_j] = iħε_ijk S_k`. For our case, `[S_y, S_z] = iħS_x`.\nSubstituting this in, we get:\n`d⟨S_z⟩/dt = (-iγB/ħ)(iħ⟨S_x⟩) = γB⟨S_x⟩` (Equation 1)\n\nThis shows that the rate of change of `⟨S_z⟩` depends on `⟨S_x⟩`. Now we need to find the rate of change of `⟨S_x⟩`:\n`d⟨S_x⟩/dt = (i/ħ)⟨[H, S_x]⟩ = (i/ħ)⟨[-γBS_y, S_x]⟩ = (-iγB/ħ)⟨[S_y, S_x]⟩`\n\nUsing the commutation relation `[S_y, S_x] = -[S_x, S_y] = -iħS_z`.\n`d⟨S_x⟩/dt = (-iγB/ħ)(-iħ⟨S_z⟩) = -γB⟨S_z⟩` (Equation 2)\n\n### 4. Solve the System of Differential Equations\nLet's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. Our system of equations is:\n1. `d⟨S_z⟩/dt = ω⟨S_x⟩`\n2. `d⟨S_x⟩/dt = -ω⟨S_z⟩`\n\nTo find the oscillation frequency of `⟨S_z⟩`, we can differentiate Equation 1 with respect to time:\n`d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = ω(d⟨S_x⟩/dt)`\n\nNow, substitute Equation 2 into this expression:\n`d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = ω(-ω⟨S_z⟩) = -ω²⟨S_z⟩`\n\nThis gives us the final differential equation for `⟨S_z⟩`:\n`d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² + ω²⟨S_z⟩ = 0`\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The solution for `⟨S_z⟩(t)` will be a sinusoidal function with an angular frequency `ω`.\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe angular frequency of oscillation is `ω`. From our definition, `ω = γB`.\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency, and the options provided are in units of angular frequency.\n\nThis physical phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector, initially pointing along the Z-axis, precesses around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The z-component of the spin (and thus the magnetic moment) oscillates as a result of this precession.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
