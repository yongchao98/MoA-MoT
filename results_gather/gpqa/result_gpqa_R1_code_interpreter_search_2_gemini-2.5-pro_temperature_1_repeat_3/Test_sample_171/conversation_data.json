    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The question relates the population of atomic energy levels to temperature. This is described by the **Boltzmann distribution**, which applies to systems in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), as assumed for the stellar photospheres.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state `j` (N_j) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state `i` (N_i) is given by:\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n    Where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the energy levels `j` and `i`.\n    *   `E_j` and `E_i` are the energies of the levels.\n    *   ΔE = E_j - E_i is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Define the \"excitation\" for each star:** The problem states that the \"excitation\" in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let's define the excitation `X` as the ratio of atoms in the specific excited state to those in a lower state, i.e., `X = N_j / N_i`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Boltzmann equation to each star:**\n    *   For star_1 (temperature T_1):\n        X_1 = (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star_2 (temperature T_2):\n        X_2 = (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n    *   Note that `ΔE`, `g_j`, and `g_i` are properties of the iron atom and are the same for both stars.\n\n5.  **Use the information given in the problem:** We are told that `X_1 = 2 * X_2`.\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:**\n    *   The statistical weight term `(g_j / g_i)` cancels out from both sides:\n        exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n    *   Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    *   Using the logarithm rules `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n        -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n        -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n7.  **Rearrange the equation to solve for the temperatures:**\n    *   Move the terms with `ΔE` to one side of the equation:\n        ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n    *   Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n        (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n    *   Find a common denominator for the terms in the parenthesis:\n        (ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n\n8.  **Evaluate the pre-factor (ΔE / k):**\n    *   The problem gives the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio (ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K.\n    *   This is a common simplification in physics problems where the numerical values are chosen to make parts of the equation equal to 1.\n\n9.  **Substitute the value of the pre-factor back into the equation:**\n    *   (1) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n    *   This simplifies to:\n        ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\n10. **Compare with the given options:** This final expression matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
