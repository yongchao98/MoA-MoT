    "An oscillating spheroid charge distribution acts as an oscillating electric dipole, especially in the radiation zone (far-field). The axis of oscillation is given as the z-axis.\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nFor an oscillating electric dipole with its moment aligned along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, is given by the formula:\n\n`dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `K` is a constant that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment, the frequency of oscillation, and fundamental physical constants.\n*   `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\nThe function `f` mentioned in the problem corresponds to this `dP/dΩ`. So, `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`.\n\nThe maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which happens at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n\nSo, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = K * sin²(90°) = K * 1 = K`.\n\nWe need to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n\nPower at `θ = 30°` is `(dP/dΩ)_(θ=30°) = K * sin²(30°)`.\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power `A`:\n\nFraction = `[(dP/dΩ)_(θ=30°)] / A = [K * sin²(30°)] / K = sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nTherefore, the fraction is `(1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe full formula for the time-averaged power per unit solid angle is:\n\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32π² ε₀ c³) * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `p₀` is the amplitude of the electric dipole moment.\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe radiated power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ)`, is directly proportional to `ω⁴`:\n\n`f ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the equation `ω = 2πν`, where `ν` is the frequency, and `c = νλ`. This gives `ν = c/λ`, so `ω = 2πc/λ`.\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality for `f`:\n\n`f ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nSo, a possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the two results:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
