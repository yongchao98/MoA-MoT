    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information about the compound:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituent groups attached.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **FTIR data:**\n        *   A peak for a **carbonyl group (C=O)** indicates that one of the substituents contains this functional group.\n        *   A peak for an **aromatic-halogen bond** indicates that the other substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Deduce the structure of the compound:**\n    *   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the carbonyl group and the remaining 2 carbon atoms. The only common and stable chemical group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The molecular formula is C8H7OX.\n    *   Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, there are three possible positional isomers: ortho (1,2-), meta (1,3-), and para (1,4-).\n\n3.  **Predict the general features of the 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The acetyl group has a methyl group (-CH3). These 3 protons are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Because the methyl group is attached to a carbonyl group, its chemical shift will be downfield, typically in the range of **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons (C6H4). These protons will appear in the aromatic region of the spectrum, typically between **6.5 ppm and 8.5 ppm**. The splitting pattern will depend on the relative positions of the two substituents (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n4.  **Analyze the given 1H NMR data options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This signal is a singlet integrating to 3 hydrogens at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the predicted signal for the methyl group (-CH3) of the acetyl substituent.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: These are two signals in the aromatic region. They are both doublets (d), and each integrates to 2 hydrogens, for a total of 4 aromatic protons. This symmetrical pattern of two doublets is highly characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substituted** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, the two protons ortho to one substituent are chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are also chemically equivalent. Each set appears as a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent proton. This option is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The signals at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical chemical shift range for aromatic protons (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n        *   The singlet at 1.3 ppm is too upfield for a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl.\n        *   This spectrum is inconsistent with an aromatic ketone.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The problem states the presence of a carbonyl group, but the structure deduced is a ketone (-COCH3), which has no proton directly attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n        *   This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   Similar to option B, the signals at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm are outside the aromatic region.\n        *   A singlet integrating to 2H at 1.3 ppm is also inconsistent with the proposed structure.\n        *   This option is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Option A is the only choice that matches the predicted 1H NMR spectrum for the deduced structure, which is a **4-haloacetophenone**. It correctly shows the singlet for the acetyl methyl group and the characteristic pair of doublets for a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n<<<A>>>"
