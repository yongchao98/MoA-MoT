    "*   **Analysis of the Goal:** The objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This requires inactivating the gene responsible for its synthesis. The most effective way to inactivate a gene is to introduce a mutation that halts the production of the functional protein.\n\n*   **Understanding Gene Expression:** The DNA sequence is read in groups of three nucleotides, called codons. The process starts at the `ATG` (start) codon and continues until a stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`) is reached. The resulting chain of amino acids folds into a protein.\n\n*   **Types of Mutations and Their Effects:**\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A change in a nucleotide that results in a different amino acid being coded. This may or may not affect the protein's function, depending on the importance of that specific amino acid.\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** A change that codes for the same amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is highly likely to inactivate the protein.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change that converts an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon. This terminates protein synthesis prematurely, creating a shortened (truncated) and almost always non-functional protein. This is a very reliable way to inactivate a gene.\n\n*   **Analyzing the Mutants:** Let's break down the intact gene's initial codons and compare them to the mutants.\n\n    *   **Intact gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT ... -3’`\n        *   Codon 1: `ATG` (Start/Methionine)\n        *   Codon 2: `TTT` (Phenylalanine)\n        *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leucine)\n        *   Codon 4: `GCT` (Alanine)\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ... -3’`\n        *   The sequence `TTT CTC` has changed to `TTC TAC`.\n        *   `TTT` -> `TTC` still codes for Phenylalanine (a silent mutation).\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid. This might not be enough to inactivate the protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ... -3’`\n        *   The sequence `TTT CTC` has changed to `TTC TAA`.\n        *   `TTT` -> `TTC` still codes for Phenylalanine (a silent mutation).\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAA` (a **STOP codon**). This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause protein synthesis to stop after only two amino acids. The resulting protein will be extremely short and non-functional. This is the most likely mutation to eliminate the compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT ... -3’`\n        *   There are two changes compared to the intact gene: `CTC` -> `TAC` (Leucine -> Tyrosine) and `ACT` -> `GTC` (Threonine -> Valine). These are two separate **missense mutations**. While two changes are more disruptive than one, it is still not as definitive as a stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ... -3’`\n        *   Comparing to the intact gene, `CTC` is changed to `TAC` (Leucine -> Tyrosine), and the `GGT` codon is deleted. Deleting a full codon (3 base pairs) removes one amino acid (Glycine) but does not shift the reading frame. This mutant has one missense mutation and one amino acid deletion. This is disruptive, but less likely to cause complete inactivation than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) very early in the gene sequence. This will truncate the protein, making it non-functional. This is the most reliable way among the given options to eliminate the synthesis of the final compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
