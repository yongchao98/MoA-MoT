    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n    *   The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%.\n    *   Let the formula of A2 be YF_n. The atomic mass of fluorine is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    *   The mass percentage of Y is 100% - 31.96% = 68.04%.\n    *   The formula for mass percentage is: ωF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F), where M_Y and M_F are the molar masses of Y and F.\n    *   0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\n    *   Solving for M_Y gives: M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    *   We can test integer values for n, which represents the oxidation state of Y, to find potential elements.\n        *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 (Closest element: K, Ca)\n        *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.90 (Closest element: Br, Se)\n        *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 (Closest element: Sb - Antimony, M=121.76)\n        *   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.80 (Closest element: Dy, Tb)\n        *   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 (Closest element: Bi)\n        *   n=6: M_Y ≈ 242.70 (Closest element: Pu, Am)\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates for Y**\n    *   Let's check the mass percentage for the most likely candidates:\n        *   **If Y=Sb (Antimony) and n=3**, A2 would be SbF3.\n            *   M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3*19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n            *   ωF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 = 0.3188 or 31.88%. This is a very close match to the given 31.96%.\n        *   **If Y=Pu (Plutonium) and n=6**, A2 would be PuF6. Using the Pu-242 isotope (M=242.06):\n            *   M(PuF6) = 242.06 + 6*19.00 = 356.06 g/mol.\n            *   ωF = (6 * 19.00) / 356.06 = 114 / 356.06 = 0.3201 or 32.01%. This is also an excellent match.\n\n3.  **Use Molecular Weight Options to Narrow Down Y**\n    *   The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4, which is another binary fluoride of Y. The options are: A) 220-240, B) 110-130, C) 160-180, D) 140-160.\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weights of the known fluorides for our candidates.\n        *   **If Y=Pu**, the known fluorides are PuF3, PuF4, PuF6. Their molecular weights (using M(Pu)≈244) are:\n            *   MW(PuF3) ≈ 244 + 57 = 301 g/mol\n            *   MW(PuF4) ≈ 244 + 76 = 320 g/mol\n            *   MW(PuF6) ≈ 244 + 114 = 358 g/mol\n            *   All of these values are far outside the given ranges (110-240). Therefore, **Y cannot be Plutonium**.\n        *   **If Y=Sb**, the known fluorides are SbF3 and SbF5. Their molecular weights are:\n            *   MW(SbF3) = 121.76 + 57 = 178.76 g/mol\n            *   MW(SbF5) = 121.76 + 95 = 216.76 g/mol\n            *   MW(SbF3) = 178.76 falls into range **C) 160-180**.\n            *   MW(SbF5) = 216.76 is close to but outside range A) 220-240.\n    *   This strongly suggests that **Y is Antimony (Sb)**, and A4 is likely SbF3.\n\n4.  **Construct a Consistent Scenario with Y=Sb**\n    *   Let's assume Y=Sb and see if the other clues fit.\n    *   **Y = Sb**. Five binary compounds are known (e.g., SbF3, SbF5, and subhalides could exist).\n    *   **A2 = SbF3**. This is confirmed by the mass percentage calculation.\n    *   **A1**: A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine. This means A1 must be a higher fluoride, so **A1 = SbF5**. The reaction is `SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2`. (Note: This reaction typically requires heat, and SbF5 is colorless, not red. In complex chemistry problems, some qualitative details can be slightly inaccurate or refer to specific non-standard conditions. We proceed based on the stronger quantitative evidence).\n    *   **A3**: A3 is formed by fluorinating Y (Sb) and it oxidizes xenon. This also points to **A3 = SbF5**, which is a strong oxidizer and Lewis acid that reacts with xenon compounds.\n    *   **A4 and A5**: A5 is obtained by adding Y (Sb) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. The reaction is `Sb + A4 -> A5`. A5 then decomposes in water into two substances.\n        *   We need to determine if A4 is SbF3 or SbF5.\n        *   If we assume **A4 = SbF3**, the reaction is `Sb + SbF3 -> A5` (1:1 ratio). This stoichiometry perfectly forms the antimony subfluoride **A5 = Sb2F3**.\n        *   Let's check the final clue for this assignment. A5 (Sb2F3) is an unstable subhalide that would readily decompose in water (e.g., via hydrolysis and disproportionation) into multiple substances, such as Sb metal and SbOF/HF. This fits the description \"decomposes with the formation of two substances\".\n        *   If we were to assume A4=SbF5, the 1:1 reaction `Sb + SbF5` does not lead to a simple, known product. The known comproportionation is `2Sb + 3SbF5 -> 5SbF3`, which is not a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Therefore, the most consistent assignment is **A4 = SbF3**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n    *   Our deduced identity for A4 is SbF3.\n    *   The molecular weight of SbF3 is M(Sb) + 3 * M(F) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    *   This value falls within the range **C) 160-180**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
