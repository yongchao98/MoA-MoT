    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Metric and the Area Element**\n    The given metric is:\n    $ds^{2}=g_{xx}dx^{2}+g_{yy}dy^{2} = \\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n    This is a 2-dimensional metric in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$. The metric tensor is a diagonal matrix:\n    $g_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The area element $dA$ on a surface with metric tensor $g_{ij}$ is given by $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\, dx \\, dy$.\n    First, we calculate the determinant of the metric tensor:\n    $\\det(g_{ij}) = g_{xx} \\cdot g_{yy} - g_{xy} \\cdot g_{yx} = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right) - 0 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2$\n    Now, we take the square root to find the area element factor:\n    $\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n    So, the area element is:\n    $dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n2.  **Determine the Domain of Integration**\n    The problem asks for the area of the \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\". The metric becomes singular when the denominator is zero, i.e., when $4 - x^2 - y^2 = 0$, which corresponds to a circle of radius $r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = 2$. The space is defined for $4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0$, which is the open disk of radius 2 centered at the origin.\n    Therefore, the domain of integration is the disk $D = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 | x^2+y^2 < 4\\}$.\n\n3.  **Set up the Area Integral**\n    The total area $A$ is the integral of the area element $dA$ over the domain $D$:\n    $A = \\iint_D dA = \\iint_{x^2+y^2 < 4} \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n4.  **Solve the Integral using Polar Coordinates**\n    To solve this integral, it's convenient to switch to polar coordinates. Let:\n    $x = \\rho \\cos\\theta$\n    $y = \\rho \\sin\\theta$\n    Then $x^2 + y^2 = \\rho^2$. The differential area element in Cartesian coordinates relates to polar coordinates by $dx \\, dy = \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$.\n    The domain of integration in polar coordinates becomes:\n    $0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$\n    $0 \\le \\rho < 2$\n    The integral transforms to:\n    $A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-\\rho^2} \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$\n    The integral over $\\theta$ is straightforward:\n    $A = \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho \\right) = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho$\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Radial Integral**\n    The integral with respect to $\\rho$ is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2}$ approaches infinity as $\\rho$ approaches 2. We must evaluate it using a limit:\n    $I_{\\rho} = \\lim_{R \\to 2^-} \\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho$\n    We use the substitution $u = 4 - \\rho^2$. Then $du = -2\\rho \\, d\\rho$, which means $\\rho \\, d\\rho = -\\frac{1}{2} du$.\n    The limits of integration for $u$ are:\n    When $\\rho = 0$, $u = 4 - 0^2 = 4$.\n    When $\\rho = R$, $u = 4 - R^2$.\n    The integral becomes:\n    $I_{\\rho} = \\lim_{R \\to 2^-} \\int_{4}^{4-R^2} \\frac{32}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} du\\right) = \\lim_{R \\to 2^-} \\left( -16 \\int_{4}^{4-R^2} \\frac{1}{u} \\, du \\right)$\n    $= \\lim_{R \\to 2^-} \\left( -16 [\\ln|u|]_{4}^{4-R^2} \\right)$\n    $= \\lim_{R \\to 2^-} \\left( -16 (\\ln(4-R^2) - \\ln(4)) \\right)$\n    $= \\lim_{R \\to 2^-} \\left( 16 (\\ln(4) - \\ln(4-R^2)) \\right) = \\lim_{R \\to 2^-} \\left( 16 \\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{4-R^2}\\right) \\right)$\n    As $R \\to 2^-$, the term $4-R^2$ approaches $0$ from the positive side ($0^+$).\n    Therefore, the fraction $\\frac{4}{4-R^2}$ approaches $+\\infty$.\n    Since the natural logarithm $\\ln(x)$ approaches $+\\infty$ as $x \\to +\\infty$, the limit is:\n    $I_{\\rho} = 16 \\cdot (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion**\n    Since the radial integral diverges to infinity, the total area is:\n    $A = 2\\pi \\cdot (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n    The area of the pseudosphere is infinite. Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) $+\\infty$\n    B) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)$ (Not a constant value)\n    C) 0\n    D) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)$ (Not a constant value)\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
