    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the partition function Z for a system of three spins S1, S2, and S3.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n*   The system has three spins: S1, S2, S3.\n*   Each spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n*   The total number of possible states for the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n*   The energy of the system for a given state (S1, S2, S3) is given by the formula:\n    E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n\n**2. Define the Partition Function**\nThe partition function, Z, is defined as the sum of the Boltzmann factor, `exp(-βE)`, over all possible states of the system.\nZ = Σ_states exp(-βE)\nwhere β = 1/(kT).\n\nSince multiple states can have the same energy level (a property called degeneracy), we can group the states by their energy. The formula then becomes:\nZ = Σ_levels g(E) * exp(-βE)\nwhere g(E) is the degeneracy of the energy level E (i.e., the number of states with that energy).\n\n**3. Enumerate States and Calculate Energies**\nWe will list all 8 possible states and calculate the energy for each one. Let's calculate the term `S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3` first.\n\n*   **State 1:** (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1)\n    `1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3`\n    E = -J(3) = -3J\n\n*   **State 2:** (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1)\n    `1*1 + 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1`\n    E = -J(-1) = J\n\n*   **State 3:** (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1)\n    `1*(-1) + 1*1 + (-1)*1 = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1`\n    E = -J(-1) = J\n\n*   **State 4:** (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1)\n    `(-1)*1 + (-1)*1 + 1*1 = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1`\n    E = -J(-1) = J\n\n*   **State 5:** (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1)\n    `1*(-1) + 1*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1`\n    E = -J(-1) = J\n\n*   **State 6:** (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1)\n    `(-1)*1 + (-1)*(-1) + 1*(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1`\n    E = -J(-1) = J\n\n*   **State 7:** (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1)\n    `(-1)*(-1) + (-1)*1 + (-1)*1 = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1`\n    E = -J(-1) = J\n\n*   **State 8:** (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1)\n    `(-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`\n    E = -J(3) = -3J\n\n**4. Determine Energy Levels and Degeneracies**\nNow, we group the states by their energy values to find the degeneracy of each energy level.\n\n*   **Energy Level E1 = -3J:**\n    This energy occurs for states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    The degeneracy is g(E1) = 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level E2 = J:**\n    This energy occurs for all the other 6 states.\n    The degeneracy is g(E2) = 6.\n\nWe have accounted for all 2 + 6 = 8 states.\n\n**5. Calculate the Partition Function**\nUsing the formula Z = Σ g(E) * exp(-βE), we can now calculate the partition function:\n\nZ = g(E1) * exp(-βE1) + g(E2) * exp(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β * J)\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
