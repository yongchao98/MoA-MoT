    "*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. In conjunction with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), which typically absorbs in the 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ range.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond (alkene). Vinyl hydrogens are those attached directly to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group itself, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45).\n\n*   **Synthesis of Information:**\n    1.  The combined evidence from FTIR and Mass Spectrometry points unequivocally to the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This allows us to eliminate options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    2.  The evidence from FTIR and 1H NMR confirms the presence of a C=C double bond.\n    3.  Therefore, the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Determining the Correct Formula using Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - H/2.\n    *   Our molecule has one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid), which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   It also has one C=C double bond (from the alkene), which accounts for another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The total required DoU is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This formula represents a molecule with only one degree of unsaturation (e.g., a saturated carboxylic acid like hexanoic acid). This contradicts the evidence of a C=C bond.\n    *   **D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This formula represents a molecule with two degrees of unsaturation, which is perfectly consistent with having one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The only formula that accommodates all the spectroscopic evidence (an unsaturated carboxylic acid) is C6H10O2.\n\nTo verify the Degree of Unsaturation calculations:\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a given molecular formula C_x H_y O_z.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    counts = {elem: (int(count) if count else 1) for elem, count in parts}\n    C = counts.get('C', 0)\n    H = counts.get('H', 0)\n    \n    # Formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    # For CHO compounds, it simplifies to C + 1 - H/2\n    if C > 0:\n        dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n        print(f\"Formula: {formula}, Degree of Unsaturation: {int(dou)}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Formula: {formula}, Invalid for DoU calculation\")\n\ncalculate_dou(\"C6H12O\")\ncalculate_dou(\"C6H12O2\")\ncalculate_dou(\"C6H10O\")\ncalculate_dou(\"C6H10O2\")\n```\n<<<D>>>",
    "The analysis of the provided spectroscopic data leads to the identification of the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group, which, combined with the O-H peak, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), indicating an alkene.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The presence of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the existence of a C=C double bond in the molecule.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic fragmentation pattern for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment.\n\n*   **Putting It All Together:**\n    1.  The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This eliminates choices A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O).\n    2.  The molecule also contains a C=C double bond in addition to the C=O double bond of the acid. This requires a certain degree of unsaturation (DoU). The DoU is the number of rings plus pi bonds in a molecule.\n    3.  A C=O double bond contributes one degree of unsaturation.\n    4.  A C=C double bond contributes another degree of unsaturation.\n    5.  Therefore, the molecule must have a total of at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\n*   **Calculating the Degree of Unsaturation for the Remaining Options:**\n    The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   For **B) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This DoU only accounts for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond and does not allow for a C=C bond.\n    *   For **D) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This DoU accounts for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond.\n\nThe only formula that fits all the evidence—a six-carbon molecule containing a carboxylic acid and an alkene—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
