    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method, which detects exoplanets by observing the Doppler shift in the host star's spectral lines. The shift in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight. The maximum observed shift, or amplitude of the shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$), corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max} \\propto K$\n\n2.  **Relate Star's Velocity to Planet's Properties:** The star's velocity ($v_{star}$) is caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. For a star of mass $M_{star}$ and a planet of mass $m_p$, conservation of momentum for the star-planet system implies:\n    *   $M_{star} v_{star} = m_p v_p$\n    *   Where $v_p$ is the planet's orbital velocity.\n    *   The observed radial velocity amplitude $K$ is related to $v_{star}$ by $K = v_{star} \\sin(i)$, where $i$ is the orbital inclination. Since no information is given about the inclination, we assume it's the same for both systems, so the $\\sin(i)$ factor will cancel out in the ratio. Therefore, we can say $K \\propto v_{star}$.\n    *   $K \\propto v_{star} = \\frac{m_p}{M_{star}} v_p$\n\n3.  **Incorporate Orbital Mechanics:** For a circular orbit, the planet's orbital velocity $v_p$ is given by $v_p = \\frac{2 \\pi a}{P}$, where $a$ is the orbital radius (semi-major axis) and $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   Substituting this into the expression for K:\n        $K \\propto \\frac{m_p}{M_{star}} \\frac{2 \\pi a}{P}$\n\n4.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period $P$ and the semi-major axis $a$ to the star's mass $M_{star}$ (assuming $m_p \\ll M_{star}$):\n    *   $P^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_{star}}$\n    *   Rearranging to solve for $a$:\n        $a^3 \\propto M_{star} P^2 \\implies a \\propto (M_{star} P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations to Find the Key Relationship:** Now, substitute the expression for $a$ back into the expression for $K$:\n    *   $K \\propto \\frac{m_p}{M_{star}} \\frac{1}{P} (M_{star} P^2)^{1/3}$\n    *   $K \\propto \\frac{m_p}{M_{star}} \\frac{1}{P} M_{star}^{1/3} P^{2/3}$\n    *   $K \\propto m_p M_{star}^{-2/3} P^{-1/3}$\n\n6.  **Apply to the Specific Problem:** The problem states that the star masses are the same ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the planet masses are the same ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$). Therefore, the terms $m_p$ and $M_{star}^{-2/3}$ are constant for both systems. This leaves us with a simple proportionality:\n    *   $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n    *   Since $\\Delta \\lambda_{max} \\propto K$, we have:\n        $\\Delta \\lambda_{max} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Periods:** We can write the relationship as an equation with a constant of proportionality: $\\Delta \\lambda \\cdot P^{1/3} = \\text{constant}$. Applying this to both systems:\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_1 \\cdot P_1^{1/3} = \\Delta \\lambda_2 \\cdot P_2^{1/3}$\n    *   We want to find the ratio $P_2 / P_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n        $\\frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_1^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2}$\n    *   To solve for the ratio of the periods, we cube both sides:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2}\\right)^3$\n\n8.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms\n    *   $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n9.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is closest to option D.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods\n# The relationship is P2/P1 = (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)^3\ndelta_lambda_1 = 5\ndelta_lambda_2 = 7\n\n# Calculate the ratio\nratio = (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\n\n<<<D>>>",

Formulate the Ratio**\n\n*   Since $\\Delta \\lambda_{max} \\propto K$, we can also write:\n    $\\Delta \\lambda_{max} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n*   This means that $\\Delta \\lambda_{max} \\cdot P^{1/3}$ is a constant.

    "The reasoning and calculation are as follows:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Relationship:** The radial velocity (RV) method relies on the Doppler shift. The amplitude of the wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$).\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max} \\propto K$\n\n2.  **Star's Velocity Amplitude (K):** The star's velocity amplitude, for a single planet in a circular orbit, is given by a formula that incorporates the masses of the star ($M_{\\star}$) and the planet ($m_p$), and the planet's orbital period ($P$). The derived relationship is:\n    *   $K \\propto \\frac{m_p}{M_{\\star}^{2/3} P^{1/3}}$\n\n3.  **Applying Problem Conditions:**\n    *   The problem states the stars have the same mass ($M_{\\star,1} = M_{\\star,2}$).\n    *   The planets also have the same mass ($m_{p,1} = m_{p,2}$).\n    *   Therefore, the terms $m_p$ and $M_{\\star}^{2/3}$ are constant for both systems and cancel out when we take a ratio.\n\n4.  **Simplified Proportionality:** This leaves us with a simple relationship between the velocity amplitude and the period:\n    *   $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n    *   Since $\\Delta \\lambda_{max} \\propto K$, we can write:\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Setting up the Ratio:** This proportionality means that the product $\\Delta \\lambda_{max} \\cdot P^{1/3}$ is constant.
