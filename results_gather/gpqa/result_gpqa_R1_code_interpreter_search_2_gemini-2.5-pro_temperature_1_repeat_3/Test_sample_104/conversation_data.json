    "This problem requires us to calculate the brightness variation of a star due to rotational modulation of starspots and then find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause a transit of the same depth.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Model the Star's Flux Variation:**\n    *   The star's brightness changes as it rotates, showing either its unspotted hemisphere or its spotted hemisphere to the observer.\n    *   The maximum observed flux (`F_max`) occurs when the bright, unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer.\n    *   The minimum observed flux (`F_min`) occurs when the dimmer, spotted hemisphere is facing the observer.\n    *   We can model the flux based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy radiated per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (`F ∝ T^4`).\n\n2.  **Calculate Maximum and Minimum Flux:**\n    *   Let `R_star` be the star's radius. The observed disk area is `A_disk = π * R_star^2`.\n    *   Star's effective temperature, `T_star = 6000 K`.\n    *   Spots' temperature, `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere, `f = 20% = 0.20`.\n\n    *   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`)**: The visible disk is entirely unspotted, with temperature `T_star`.\n        `F_max ∝ A_disk * T_star^4`\n\n    *   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`)**: The visible disk is the spotted one. A fraction `f` of its area is covered by spots at `T_spot`, and the remaining fraction `(1 - f)` is at `T_star`.\n        `F_min ∝ [(1 - f) * A_disk * T_star^4] + [f * A_disk * T_spot^4]`\n        `F_min ∝ A_disk * [(1 - f) * T_star^4 + f * T_spot^4]`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Amplitude of Brightness Variation:**\n    *   The amplitude of the signal is the relative change in flux between the maximum and minimum brightness.\n        `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    *   Substituting the expressions for flux (the proportionality constants and `A_disk` cancel out):\n        `Amplitude = (T_star^4 - [(1 - f) * T_star^4 + f * T_spot^4]) / T_star^4`\n        `Amplitude = (T_star^4 - T_star^4 + f * T_star^4 - f * T_spot^4) / T_star^4`\n        `Amplitude = f * (T_star^4 - T_spot^4) / T_star^4`\n        `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4)`\n\n4.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit:**\n    *   An exoplanet transit causes a dip in the star's brightness. The depth of this dip is the ratio of the light blocked by the planet to the total light from the star.\n    *   Assuming no limb darkening, the transit depth is the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n    *   Let `R_pl` be the planet's radius and `R_star` be the star's radius.\n        `Transit Depth = (π * R_pl^2) / (π * R_star^2) = (R_pl / R_star)^2`\n\n5.  **Equate the Signals and Solve:**\n    *   The problem asks for the planet size that produces the *same amplitude signal*. Therefore, we set the transit depth equal to the rotational modulation amplitude.\n        `(R_pl / R_star)^2 = Amplitude`\n        `(R_pl / R_star)^2 = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4)`\n    *   Now, we solve for the relative radius `R_pl / R_star`.\n        `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4) ]`\n\n6.  **Computation:**\n    *   We can plug the given values into the final equation and calculate the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nT_star = 6000.0  # K, effective temperature of the star\nT_spot = 5000.0  # K, temperature of the spots (T_star - 1000 K)\nf = 0.20         # Filling factor of spots\n\n# 1. Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4)\namplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)**4)\n\n# 2. The transit depth for an exoplanet is (R_pl / R_star)^2\n# We set the transit depth equal to the amplitude\n# (R_pl / R_star)^2 = amplitude\n\n# 3. Solve for the relative radius R_pl / R_star\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"{relative_radius:.2f}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.32\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation shows that `(R_pl / R_star)` is approximately 0.32. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning behind the solution:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Star's Brightness Variation\n\nThe problem describes a star with one hemisphere covered in dark spots. As the star rotates, we alternately see the bright, unspotted hemisphere and the dimmer, spotted hemisphere. This causes a periodic change in the star's observed brightness.\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (`F_max`):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere, with a uniform temperature `T_star`, is facing the observer.\n*   **Minimum Brightness (`F_min`):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. This hemisphere is a mix of normal stellar surface (`T_star`) and cooler spots (`T_spot`).\n\nThe flux (energy radiated per unit area) from a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, `F ∝ T^4`. The total brightness is the flux integrated over the visible disk of the star.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Amplitude of the Variation\n\nWe need to find the relative amplitude of the brightness change, which is defined as `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n\n*   **Given values:**\n    *   Star's effective temperature, `T_star = 6000 K`.\n    *   Temperature of spots, `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   Filling factor of spots, `f = 20% = 0.2`.\n\n*   **Flux Expressions (proportionality):**\n    *   `F_max` is proportional to the flux from a full disk at `T_star`.\n        `F_max ∝ T_star^4`\n    *   `F_min` is the sum of fluxes from the unspotted part (fraction `1-f`) and the spotted part (fraction `f`) of the visible disk.\n        `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star^4 + f * T_spot^4`\n\n*   **Calculating the Amplitude:**\n    Let's substitute the expressions into the amplitude formula. The common factors like the star's projected area (`π * R_star^2`) and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant will cancel out.\n\n    `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    `Amplitude = (T_star^4 - [(1 - f) * T_star^4 + f * T_spot^4]) / T_star^4`\n    `Amplitude = (T_star^4 - T_star^4 + f * T_star^4 - f * T_spot^4) / T_star^4`\n    `Amplitude = f * (T_star^4 - T_spot^4) / T_star^4`\n    `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4)`\n\n### 3. Modeling the Exoplanet Transit\n\nAn exoplanet transit causes a dip in the star's brightness by blocking a portion of its light. The depth of this transit signal is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area (assuming a simple model without limb darkening).\n\n*   `Transit Depth = Area_planet / Area_star`\n*   `Transit Depth = (π * R_pl^2) / (π * R_star^2)`\n*   `Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)^2`\n\n### 4. Equating the Signals and Solving\n\nThe problem asks for the planet size that produces the same amplitude signal as the rotating starspots. Therefore, we set the transit depth equal to the spot-induced amplitude.\n\n*   `Transit Depth = Amplitude`\n*   `(R_pl / R_star)^2 = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4)`\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius `R_pl / R_star` by taking the square root:\n\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4) ]`\n\n### 5. Calculation\n\nPlugging in the numerical values:\n\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)^4) ]`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ]`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225) ]`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * 0.51775 ]`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.10355 ]`\n*   `R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<C>>>"
