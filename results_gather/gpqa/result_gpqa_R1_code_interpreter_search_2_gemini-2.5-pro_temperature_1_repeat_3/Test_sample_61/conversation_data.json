    "This problem asks for the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Starting Material**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. Its structure is a cyclohexane ring attached to an ethynyl group (-C≡CH). Formula: C6H11-C≡CH.\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's break down this IUPAC name to determine the structure.\n    *   The parent structure is \"cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\". This is a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (-CHO) attached.\n    *   The \"1-\" indicates the position of a substituent on the cyclohexane ring. By convention, the carbon atom of the ring attached to the principal functional group (the carbaldehyde group) is numbered C1.\n    *   The substituent at C1 is \"(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)\". This group is a methyl group (-CH3) where one hydrogen is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) and another hydrogen is replaced by a cyclohexyl group (-C6H11). So the substituent is -CH(OH)(C6H11).\n    *   Therefore, the final structure has two groups attached to C1 of a cyclohexane ring: a -CHO group and a -CH(OH)(C6H11) group.\n    *   This structure is an α-hydroxy aldehyde. It is the product of an aldol self-condensation reaction of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C6H11CHO).\n\n**Mechanism of Aldol Condensation:**\n1.  A base (like Ba(OH)2) removes the α-proton from one molecule of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The α-carbon is C1 of the ring. This forms an enolate.\n2.  The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n3.  Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields the final product, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**The overall strategy must be:**\n1.  Synthesize cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane.\n2.  Perform a self-aldol condensation on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it follows this strategy.\n\n**Option A:**\n1.  **NaNH2, ethyl chloride:** Ethynylcyclohexane is deprotonated by NaNH2 to form sodium cyclohexylacetylide (C6H11-C≡C-Na+). This nucleophile reacts with ethyl chloride in an SN2 reaction to form 1-cyclohexylbut-1-yne (C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3).\n2.  **Li/liq. NH3:** This is a dissolving metal reduction, which reduces internal alkynes to *trans*-alkenes. Product: *trans*-1-cyclohexylbut-1-ene.\n3.  **O3/ H2O:** This is ozonolysis with an *oxidative* workup. It cleaves the double bond to form carboxylic acids. Products: cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (C6H11-COOH) and propanoic acid (CH3CH2-COOH).\n4.  **NH4OH:** A weak base that would neutralize the acids.\n*Conclusion for A:* This sequence produces carboxylic acids, not the required cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate. So, A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:**\n1.  **NaNH2, methanol:** NaNH2 deprotonates ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide. Methanol (pKa ≈ 15.5) is a much stronger acid than the terminal alkyne (pKa ≈ 25). Thus, methanol will immediately protonate the acetylide, regenerating the starting material (ethynylcyclohexane). This first step is unproductive for synthesis.\n*Conclusion for B:* The first step is nonsensical in a synthetic sequence. So, B is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\n1.  **NaNH2, methyl chloride:** Similar to step 1 in A, this is an alkylation of the terminal alkyne. The acetylide reacts with methyl chloride to form 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne (C6H11-C≡C-CH3).\n2.  **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate:** This is Lindlar's catalyst, used for the stereoselective partial hydrogenation of an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene. Product: *cis*-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene (cis-C6H11-CH=CH-CH3).\n3.  **O3/ (CH3)2S:** This is ozonolysis with a *reductive* workup (using dimethyl sulfide). It cleaves the double bond to form aldehydes and/or ketones. Cleavage of *cis*-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene gives two aldehydes: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C6H11-CHO) and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO). This step successfully synthesizes the required intermediate.\n4.  **Ba(OH)2:** This is a base used to catalyze an aldol condensation. In the mixture of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde, several aldol reactions can occur. One of these is the self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which, as established earlier, yields the desired target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Although other side products will form, this sequence is a valid method to synthesize the target compound.\n*Conclusion for C:* This sequence describes a series of valid chemical reactions that produce the required intermediate and then convert it to the final product. So, C is a correct sequence.\n\n**Option D:**\nThis option appears to have a typo, listing two different reactions for step 2 and repeating step number 3. Let's analyze both possibilities for the second step.\n*   **Path D with H2/Pd:**\n    1.  **NaNH2, methyl chloride:** Forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n    2.  **H2/Pd:** This catalyst performs complete hydrogenation, reducing the alkyne all the way to an alkane. Product: 1-cyclohexylpropane (C6H11-CH2CH2CH3). This alkane is unreactive towards the subsequent reagents. This path is a dead end.\n*   **Path D with H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O:**\n    1.  **NaNH2, methyl chloride:** Forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n    2.  **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O:** This is Markovnikov hydration of an alkyne (oxymercuration-demercuration). It adds H and OH across the triple bond to form a ketone. Product: 1-cyclohexylpropan-1-one (C6H11-C(=O)-CH2CH3).\n    3.  **Ba(OH)2:** This would catalyze an aldol condensation of the ketone, leading to a β-hydroxy ketone, which is not the target α-hydroxy aldehyde.\n*Conclusion for D:* Neither interpretation of this flawed option leads to the target molecule. So, D is incorrect.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis, only option C describes a chemically viable pathway from the starting material to the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
