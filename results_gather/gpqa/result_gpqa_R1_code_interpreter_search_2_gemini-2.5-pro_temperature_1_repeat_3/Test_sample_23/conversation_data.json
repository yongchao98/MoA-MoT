    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the molecular formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of Hydrogen (H) is given by: `(y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H)) = 0.1428`.\n    *   The mass fraction of Carbon (C) is `1 - 0.1428 = 0.8572`.\n    *   Let's find the empirical formula by determining the ratio of moles of C to H:\n        *   Ratio C:H = `(Mass% C / AtomicMass C) : (Mass% H / AtomicMass H)`\n        *   Using approximate atomic masses (C≈12, H≈1):\n        *   Ratio C:H = `(85.72 / 12) : (14.28 / 1)` = `7.14 : 14.28`\n        *   Dividing by the smallest number (7.14), we get the ratio `1 : 2`.\n    *   The empirical formula is CH₂. The molecular formula must be a multiple of this, i.e., CnH2n.\n    *   Let's verify the mass fraction with the formula CnH2n:\n        *   Mass fraction H = `(2n * 1) / (12n + 2n)` = `2n / 14n` = `1/7`.\n        *   `1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which matches the given 14.28%.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a **cycloalkane**.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reactions and Mixtures**\n    *   **Hydrogenation**: Both mixture X and mixture Y, when hydrogenated, yield *only* substance Z. This is a crucial clue. It means all the constituent molecules in both mixtures have the same carbon skeleton, which is the C_n ring of the cycloalkane Z.\n    *   **Mixture Y**: It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates the components are saturated or aromatic. We are told Z (the cycloalkane CnH2n) is one of the constituents of Y. Let's call it Y₁. The other constituent, Y₂, must also have the same C_n skeleton, must not decolorize bromine water, and must hydrogenate to Z. The only class of compounds that fits this description is arenes (aromatic hydrocarbons). A simple arene with a C_n skeleton would be a derivative of benzene, with the formula CnH(2n-6).\n        *   So, Y = { CnH2n (Z, a cycloalkane), CnH(2n-6) (an arene) }.\n    *   **Mixture X**: It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids that *do* decolorize bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). The problem states they have no conjugated multiple bonds. Both components of X must hydrogenate to Z (the CnH2n cycloalkane). This means they are cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes with the same C_n ring skeleton.\n    *   **Disproportionation**: Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y upon heating with platinum. `Mixture X -> Mixture Y`. This is described as a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n        *   The overall transformation is from a mixture of unsaturated compounds (X) to a mixture of a saturated compound (Y₁) and an aromatic compound (Y₂).\n        *   The reaction must be between the two components of X to produce the two components of Y. Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the stoichiometry is 1:1.\n        *   `X₁ + X₂ -> Y₁ + Y₂`\n        *   Let's consider the level of unsaturation. To get the highly stable aromatic ring (Y₂) and the stable saturated ring (Y₁), the most plausible reaction involves a cycloalkadiene being oxidized (losing H) and a cycloalkene being reduced (gaining H).\n        *   Let X₁ be a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene, CnH(2n-4).\n        *   Let X₂ be a cycloalkene, CnH(2n-2).\n        *   The reaction would be: CnH(2n-4) + CnH(2n-2) -> CnH(2n-6) + CnH2n.\n        *   Let's check the hydrogen balance: The diene loses 2H to become the arene. The alkene gains 2H to become the alkane. The hydrogen transfer is perfectly balanced for a 1:1 reaction. This confirms our model.\n\n3.  **Determine the specific compounds and the value of 'n'**\n    *   The chemistry described (disproportionation on Pt to form an alkane and an arene) is most classically associated with six-membered rings, due to the high stability of the benzene ring. Let's test the simplest case, n=6.\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). It's a widely used solvent.\n        *   Y = {Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), Benzene (C₆H₆)}. Both are liquids and don't decolorize Br₂ water. This fits.\n        *   X = {A cycloalkadiene C₆H(2*6-4) = C₆H₈, and a cycloalkene C₆H(2*6-2) = C₆H₁₀}.\n        *   The diene must be non-conjugated, which means it is **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. The alkene is **cyclohexene**. Both are liquids and decolorize Br₂ water. This also fits perfectly.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of X.\n    *   Component 1: Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Component 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis solution is self-consistent and fits all the constraints of the problem. While other values for 'n' (like n=7, leading to an answer of 22) are theoretically possible, the n=6 case represents the most fundamental and classic example of this type of reaction, making it the most likely intended answer in a problem of this nature.\n\nFinal Answer check:\n- X = {C₆H₁₀, C₆H₈}, equimolar, unsaturated, non-conjugated. OK.\n- Y = {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆}, equimolar, saturated/aromatic. OK.\n- Reaction: C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ -> C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ (H-transfer). OK.\n- Hydrogenation of all components gives Z = C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane). OK.\n- Z has H% = 12/84 = 14.28%. OK.\n- Total H atoms in X = 10 + 8 = 18. OK.\n\nThe final answer corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
