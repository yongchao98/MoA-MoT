    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem involves a conservative force (from the spring) acting on a particle moving at relativistic speeds. The governing principle is the conservation of total energy.\n\n2.  **Define the total energy:** For a relativistic particle of rest mass `m` moving with velocity `v` in a potential `U(x)`, the total conserved energy `E_total` is the sum of its relativistic energy and potential energy.\n    *   Relativistic energy is `E_rel = γmc²`, where `γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`. This includes the rest energy `mc²` and the kinetic energy `K = (γ - 1)mc²`.\n    *   The potential energy for a spring obeying Hooke's law (`F = -kx`) is `U(x) = (1/2)kx²`.\n    *   Therefore, the total conserved energy is `E_total = γmc² + (1/2)kx²`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the system at the point of maximum amplitude:**\n    *   At the maximum amplitude, the position is `x = A`.\n    *   The particle momentarily stops, so its velocity is `v = 0`.\n    *   At `v = 0`, the Lorentz factor `γ = 1/sqrt(1 - 0²/c²) = 1`.\n    *   The total energy at this point (`E_1`) is:\n        `E_1 = (1)mc² + (1/2)kA² = mc² + (1/2)kA²`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the system at the point of maximum speed:**\n    *   The maximum speed (`v_max`) occurs when the particle passes through the equilibrium position, where the potential energy is minimum.\n    *   At the equilibrium position, `x = 0`, so the potential energy `U(0) = 0`.\n    *   The velocity is `v = v_max`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor at this speed is `γ_max = 1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)`.\n    *   The total energy at this point (`E_2`) is:\n        `E_2 = γ_max * mc² + 0 = γ_max * mc²`.\n\n5.  **Apply the conservation of energy:** The total energy of the system is constant, so `E_1 = E_2`.\n    `mc² + (1/2)kA² = γ_max * mc²`\n\n6.  **Solve for `v_max`:**\n    *   First, solve for `γ_max` by dividing the equation by `mc²`:\n        `1 + (kA²)/(2mc²) = γ_max`\n    *   Now, substitute the definition of `γ_max`:\n        `1 + (kA²)/(2mc²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) `\n    *   To solve for `v_max`, we rearrange the equation. Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n        `1 / (1 + kA²/(2mc²)) = sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) `\n    *   Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n        `1 / (1 + kA²/(2mc²))² = 1 - v_max²/c²`\n    *   Isolate the `v_max²/c²` term:\n        `v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + kA²/(2mc²))²`\n    *   Finally, take the square root and multiply by `c` to get `v_max`:\n        `v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + kA²/(2mc²))²) `\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The derived expression `v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + kA²/(2mc²))²) ` matches option D exactly.\n\n8.  **Final check (consistency):**\n    *   **Classical limit:** If `c -> ∞`, the term `kA²/(2mc²) -> 0`. We can use the Taylor expansion `(1+x)⁻² ≈ 1-2x` for small `x`. Let `x = kA²/(2mc²)`.\n        `v_max²/c² = 1 - (1+x)⁻² ≈ 1 - (1-2x) = 2x = 2(kA²/(2mc²)) = kA²/(mc²)`.\n        `v_max² ≈ kA²/m`, which is the correct classical result from `(1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA²`.\n    *   **Physical plausibility:** The term `(1 + kA²/(2mc²))` is greater than 1. Its square is also greater than 1. The reciprocal `1/(...)²` is a positive number less than 1. Therefore, the term inside the square root, `1 - 1/(...)²`, is between 0 and 1. This ensures that `v_max` is always less than `c`, as required by relativity. Options A and B would lead to `v_max > c`, which is impossible. Option C is the non-relativistic approximation.\n\nThe derivation is self-consistent and leads directly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
