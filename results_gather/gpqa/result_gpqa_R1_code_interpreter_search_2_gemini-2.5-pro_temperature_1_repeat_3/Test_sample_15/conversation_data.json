    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Optically active compounds are chiral.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. This molecule has a double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, CH3, C of ethyl) lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is essentially planar. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    This is a complex molecule with a rigid bicyclic framework. The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration at multiple stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and the geometry of a double bond (E). The designation of a specific stereoisomer with R/S descriptors means we are considering a single, pure compound from a set of possible stereoisomers. Unless this specific combination of stereocenters results in an achiral meso compound (which possesses internal symmetry like a plane or center of symmetry), the molecule will be chiral. Given the complexity and low symmetry of this structure, it is extremely unlikely to be meso. A specific enantiomer is by definition chiral. Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3. The (2R,3S) isomer is a meso compound. A meso compound is an achiral compound that has chiral centers. It possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond, making the top half a mirror image of the bottom half. Because it is achiral, it is not optically active. So, this compound is **achiral**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above. The (2R,3R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is the (2S,3S) isomer. Therefore, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at C1. C1 is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) a `-CH2-CH=` group (C2), and 4) a `-CH2-CH2-CH=` group (C6). Since the paths around the ring from C1 are different, the four groups are distinct. Thus, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single chiral molecule. Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. This designation refers to the all-cis isomer, where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring's plane. In its most stable chair conformation, all three -OH groups are equatorial (or all axial, which is less stable). This molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite carbon atom. Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. To be chiral, a molecule typically needs a chiral center or some other element of chirality. Let's check for chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized.\n    *   All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are -CH2- groups.\n    *   The butanoyl chain: -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2. No carbon is bonded to four different groups. The carbon `CH` is bonded to two identical methyl groups.\n    The molecule has no chiral centers and no other features that would make it chiral. It is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Achiral\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-...dione: **Chiral**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Achiral (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Chiral**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Chiral**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Achiral\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Achiral\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
