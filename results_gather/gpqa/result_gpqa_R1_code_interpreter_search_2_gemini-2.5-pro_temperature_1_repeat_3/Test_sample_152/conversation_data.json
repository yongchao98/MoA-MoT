    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-hydrogen (the one between the two carbonyl groups) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The carbon-carbon double bond is polarized by the electron-withdrawing ester group, making the β-carbon electrophilic. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Mechanism:** The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons from the double bond shift to form an enolate intermediate, which is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final product.\n    1.  `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` + `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃` → `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃`\n    2.  `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃` + `EtOH` → `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃` + `EtO⁻`\n*   **Product A Structure:** The final product is `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Naming Product A:** Let's analyze the name given in the options: \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\".\n    *   This name implies a propane (3-carbon) backbone.\n    *   \"1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" means there are three methyl carboxylate (`-COOCH₃`) groups, two at position C1 and one at position C3.\n    *   \"2-(p-tolyl)\" means there is a p-tolyl group (`-C₆H₄-CH₃`) at position C2.\n    *   Let's construct the molecule from this name, numbering the propane chain C1-C2-C3: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH(C1) - CH(p-tolyl)(C2) - CH₂(C3)COOCH₃`.\n    *   This structure matches the product we derived from the reaction mechanism. Therefore, the name for product A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which is a variation of the Michael addition.\n*   **Nucleophile:** The enamine, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. Enamines are neutral but are strong nucleophiles at the β-carbon (the C=C carbon not bonded to the nitrogen).\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile, forming a new C-C bond. This results in an iminium ion intermediate.\n    2.  The reaction mixture is then treated with aqueous acid (`H₃O⁺`), which hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (a ketone).\n*   **Product B Structure:** The starting enamine was formed from cyclohexanone. The nucleophilic attack occurs at the α-position relative to the future carbonyl group. The substituent added is from but-2-enenitrile, which becomes the `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group after the reaction. The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with this substituent at the 2-position (α-position).\n*   **Naming Product B:** The product is a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is the 4-carbon chain with the nitrile group: `N≡C(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(C3)-CH₃(C4)`. The substituent at C3 is the `2-oxocyclohexyl` ring. Thus, the name of the product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The final workup with `H₃O⁺` ensures the formation of the ketone (oxo) group, not the enol (hydroxy) form.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where we need to identify one of the starting materials (reactant C). This is a retrosynthesis problem.\n*   **Known Reactants & Product:**\n    *   Reactant: but-3-en-2-one (`CH₂=CH-COCH₃`), also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). This is the Michael acceptor.\n    *   Product: 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Retrosynthesis:** In a Michael addition, a C-C bond is formed between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    1.  Identify the piece from the acceptor (MVK): The structure of MVK is `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-COCH₃`. After reaction, it becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-COCH₃` group. This is the \"3-oxobutyl\" substituent in the product name.\n    2.  Identify the bond formed: This substituent is attached to C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. This means the bond formed is between the β-carbon of MVK and C2 of the donor molecule.\n    3.  Identify the donor (Reactant C): If we remove the 3-oxobutyl group from the product, we are left with the Michael donor, which must have had an acidic proton at the point of attachment. The remaining structure is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The hydrogen at C2 of this molecule is flanked by two carbonyl groups, making it very acidic and an ideal Michael donor after deprotonation by the base (KOH).\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A:** The product is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   **B:** The product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   **C:** The reactant is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nComparing these findings with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   B) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   C) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   D) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nOur deduced answers for A, B, and C perfectly match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
