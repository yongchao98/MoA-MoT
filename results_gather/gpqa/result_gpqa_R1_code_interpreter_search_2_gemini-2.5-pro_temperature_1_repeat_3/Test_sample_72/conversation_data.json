    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts:\na) The relative speed between them ($v_{rel}$).\nb) The total energy of the system ($E_{total}$).\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n*   **Astronaut 1:**\n    *   Mass ($m_1$) = 2m\n    *   Velocity ($v_1$) = 0.6c\n*   **Astronaut 2:**\n    *   Mass ($m_2$) = 3m\n    *   Velocity ($v_2$) = 0.5c\n*   Both astronauts are traveling in the same direction (positive x-direction).\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\nSince the velocities are relativistic, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula to find the relative speed. The formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n*   Substitute the given values into the formula:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n\n*   Simplify the numerator:\n    $0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$\n\n*   Simplify the denominator:\n    $1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$\n\n*   Calculate the final relative speed:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} \\approx 0.142857c$\n\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\nThe total energy of a relativistic object is given by the formula $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 + \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2$\n\n*   **Calculate the Lorentz factor for Astronaut 1 ($\\gamma_1$):**\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\n*   **Calculate the energy for Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculate the Lorentz factor for Astronaut 2 ($\\gamma_2$):**\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.866} \\approx 1.1547$\n\n*   **Calculate the energy for Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculate the total energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2 = 5.9641mc^2$\n\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, we get $E_{total} \\approx 5.96mc^2$.\n\n**5. Compare with Options**\n*   Our calculated relative speed is $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n*   Our calculated total energy is $E_{total} \\approx 5.96mc^2$.\n\nThese results match option C.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the constants and given values\nc = 1  # Speed of light (normalized to 1)\nm = 1  # Mass unit (normalized to 1)\n\n# Astronaut 1\nm1 = 2 * m\nv1 = 0.6 * c\n\n# Astronaut 2\nm2 = 3 * m\nv2 = 0.5 * c\n\n# --- Calculate Relative Speed ---\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c**2)\n\n# --- Calculate Total Energy ---\n# Lorentz factor for astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / np.sqrt(1 - v1**2 / c**2)\n# Energy of astronaut 1\nE1 = gamma1 * m1 * c**2\n\n# Lorentz factor for astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / np.sqrt(1 - v2**2 / c**2)\n# Energy of astronaut 2\nE2 = gamma2 * m2 * c**2\n\n# Total energy of the system\nE_total = E1 + E2\n\nprint(f\"Relative speed: {v_rel:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"Total energy: {E_total:.2f}mc^2\")\n```\n> Relative speed: 0.14c\n> Total energy: 5.96mc^2\n\nThe code confirms our manual calculations.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The calculations from the reasoning and the Python code output both point to the same result:\n*   **Relative speed ($v_{rel}$):** 0.14c\n*   **Total energy ($E$):** 5.96mcÂ²\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
