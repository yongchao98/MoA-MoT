    "To determine the relationship between λ1 (the mean free path of gas molecules) and λ2 (the mean free path of electrons scattering off gas molecules), we must compare the nature of their respective collisions.\n\n### Analysis of the Mean Free Path\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. It is defined by the formula:\n\n**λ = 1 / (n * σ)**\n\nwhere:\n*   **n** is the number density of the target particles.\n*   **σ** (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which is the effective area that a target particle presents to a projectile for a collision to occur.\n\nIn the scenario described, the sample compartment's volume, temperature, and pressure are constant when comparing the two situations. This means the number density (n) of the residual gas molecules is the same for both calculations. Therefore, the difference between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on the difference between their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n1.  **λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collisions):** This mean free path is determined by gas molecules colliding with each other. The collision cross-section, **σ_gas-gas**, is related to the physical size (the kinetic diameter) of the gas molecules.\n\n2.  **λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule Collisions):** This mean free path is determined by high-energy electrons from the beam colliding with the gas molecules. The collision cross-section, **σ_e-gas**, depends on the electrostatic interaction between the fast-moving electron and the atoms of the gas molecule.\n\n### Comparing the Collision Cross-Sections\n\nA high-energy electron (1000 kV) is a tiny, point-like particle moving at nearly the speed of light. A gas molecule, while small, is thousands of times more massive and orders of magnitude larger in diameter. To a fast-moving electron, a gas molecule is mostly empty space. The electron only scatters significantly if it passes very close to the atomic nucleus or one of the molecule's own electrons.\n\nIn contrast, for two gas molecules to collide, their electron clouds only need to approach each other. This results in a much larger effective target area.\n\nTherefore, the collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule is significantly smaller than the kinetic cross-section for two gas molecules colliding:\n\n**σ_e-gas < σ_gas-gas**\n\n### Conclusion on λ1 and λ2\n\nSince the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ), and σ_e-gas is smaller than σ_gas-gas, it follows that λ2 must be larger than λ1.\n\n**λ2 > λ1**\n\nThe electron will, on average, travel a much longer distance before it interacts with a gas molecule than a gas molecule will travel before colliding with another gas molecule. Looking at the given options:\n\n*   A) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect. The cross-sections are different.\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This suggests λ2 is only slightly larger than λ1. The physical difference in cross-sections suggests a much larger disparity.\n*   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This option correctly states that λ2 is larger than λ1 and allows for it to be significantly larger.\n*   D) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect. This would imply electrons collide more frequently than gas molecules, which is contrary to the physics of their interactions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate conclusion is that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. Option C is the only one that reflects this physical reality.\n\n<<<C>>>"
