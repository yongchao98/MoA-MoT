    "Here is the step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the number of atoms and bonds. The condensed formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nLet's draw the expanded structure to visualize the bonds:\n```\n      CH3           CH3           CH3\n       |             |             |\nH3C - C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C - CH3\n       |                           |\n      CH3                         CH3\n```\nNow, we count the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** There are 12 carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nNext, we count the number of C-C single bonds, C=C double bonds, and C-H single bonds.\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n*   **C=C bonds:** We can see two carbon-carbon double bonds in the structure.\n*   **C-C bonds:** We can count the single bonds between carbon atoms. There are 9 C-C single bonds (5 connecting the methyl groups to the main chain, and 4 within the main chain itself).\n\nSummary of bonds:\n*   Number of C-H bonds = 22\n*   Number of C=C bonds = 2\n*   Number of C-C bonds = 9\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom)**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. We use the given bond energies:\n*   Bond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom = (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C))\nΔH_atom = (22 × 400) + (2 × 300) + (9 × 200)\nΔH_atom = 8800 + 600 + 1800\nΔH_atom = 11200 kJ/mol\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Formation of Gaseous Atoms**\n\nThis is the energy required to form the constituent gaseous atoms (12 moles of C and 22 moles of H) from their standard states (solid carbon and H2 gas).\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon (C(s) → C(g)) = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of H-H (H2(g) → 2H(g)) = 100 kJ/mol. This means the enthalpy of formation of one mole of H(g) is 100 / 2 = 50 kJ/mol.\n\nTotal Enthalpy = (No. of C atoms × ΔH_atom(C)) + (No. of H atoms × ΔH_f(H))\nTotal Enthalpy = (12 × 1000) + (22 × 50)\nTotal Enthalpy = 12000 + 1100\nTotal Enthalpy = 13100 kJ/mol\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of the Compound (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation of the compound is the difference between the total enthalpy of formation of the gaseous atoms and the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\nΔH_f = (Total Enthalpy of Formation of Gaseous Atoms) - (Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔH_f = 1900 kJ/mol\n\n**6. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options include values in kJ/g. We need to convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g using the molar mass of the compound (C12H22).\n*   Molar mass of C ≈ 12 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of H ≈ 1 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol\n\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166\nΔH_f (kJ/g) ≈ 11.44 kJ/g\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\nA) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization)\nB) 1900 kJ/g (The value is correct for kJ/mol, but the unit is wrong)\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol (Incorrect)\nD) 11.44 kJ/g (This matches our calculation)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
