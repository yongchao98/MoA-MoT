    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a defined symmetry axis like a spheroid, is modeled in physics as an oscillating electric dipole, especially when its size is much smaller than the radiated wavelength. The behavior of its radiation can be understood through the principles of electric dipole radiation.\n\n### Angular Distribution of Power\n\nThe power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) from an oscillating electric dipole with its moment aligned along the z-axis is not uniform in all directions. It depends on the angle θ with respect to this axis. The relationship is given by the formula:\n\n*dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)*\n\nThis formula indicates that the radiated power is zero along the axis of oscillation (θ = 0°) and is at its maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis (θ = 90°).\n\nThe maximum radiated power, denoted as A, occurs when sin²(θ) is at its maximum value, which is 1 (at θ = 90°).\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of θ = 30°, we calculate sin²(30°):\n\n*   sin(30°) = 1/2\n*   sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4\n\nThe power at 30° is therefore proportional to 1/4. The fraction of the maximum power A is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n\nFraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = (k * 1/4) / (k * 1) = 1/4\n\n### Wavelength Dependence of Power\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating dipole is also strongly dependent on the frequency of oscillation, and consequently, on the wavelength of the radiation. The total radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴).\n\nThe relationship between angular frequency (ω) and wavelength (λ) is given by ω = 2πc/λ, where c is the speed of light. Substituting this into the power relationship:\n\n*   Power ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴\n\nThis λ⁻⁴ dependence is a classic result for dipole radiation and is also responsible for phenomena like Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two findings:\n1.  The fraction of the maximum power radiated at θ = 30° is **1/4**.\n2.  A possible functional form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
