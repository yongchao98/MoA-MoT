    "### Analysis of the 1H NMR Data\n\nThe provided 1H NMR data is as follows:\n*   **7.0 ppm:** 1H, doublet (d), J = 16.0 Hz\n*   **5.5 ppm:** 1H, doublet of quartets (dq)\n*   **2.1 ppm:** 3H, singlet (s)\n*   **1.6 ppm:** 3H, doublet (d)\n\nTo identify the unknown compound, we can analyze each signal and its characteristics:\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet):** This signal represents a methyl group (3 protons) that is not coupled to any adjacent protons, hence the singlet multiplicity. This is characteristic of the methyl group in an acetate functional group (CH₃-C=O), which is present in all four possible compounds.\n\n2.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:** These signals are in the chemical shift range typical for vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond).\n\n3.  **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a single vinylic proton split into a doublet, meaning it is coupled to one other proton. The crucial piece of information here is the coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. The magnitude of the J-coupling between two vinylic protons is dependent on their stereochemistry. A large coupling constant, typically in the range of 11-18 Hz, is indicative of a *trans* relationship. A *cis* relationship would show a smaller coupling constant, usually between 6-12 Hz. Therefore, the J value of 16.0 Hz strongly suggests the compound has a *trans* double bond, eliminating the *cis* isomers.\n\n4.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet):** This signal corresponds to a methyl group (3 protons) that is split into a doublet. This means it is adjacent to and coupled with a single proton. This is consistent with a methyl group attached to a double bond (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n\n5.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quartets):** This signal for a single proton is the most informative for elucidating the complete structure.\n    *   The **doublet** splitting indicates coupling to one adjacent proton. This must be the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm), and they share the same coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz).\n    *   The **quartet** splitting indicates coupling to three equivalent adjacent protons. This corresponds to the methyl group seen at 1.6 ppm.\n\n### Structure Determination\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The acetate group is confirmed by the singlet at 2.1 ppm.\n*   The *trans* configuration of the double bond is confirmed by the J = 16.0 Hz coupling constant. This rules out Cis-propenyl acetate and Cis-butenyl acetate.\n*   The structure must contain a CH₃-CH=CH- fragment. The proton on the central carbon of this fragment would be coupled to the other vinylic proton and the three protons of the methyl group, resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The methyl group's signal would be a doublet, as it is coupled to one vinylic proton.\n*   This matches the data for **Trans-propenyl acetate** (CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃).\n    *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the oxygen is the most deshielded and corresponds to the signal at **7.0 ppm**. It is a doublet because it is only coupled to the other vinylic proton.\n    *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group corresponds to the signal at **5.5 ppm**. It is a doublet (from the other vinyl H) of quartets (from the CH₃ group).\n    *   The methyl group of the acetate is the singlet at **2.1 ppm**.\n    *   The methyl group on the double bond is the doublet at **1.6 ppm**.\n\nThe butenyl acetate isomers are inconsistent with the data because they would either have additional signals (e.g., from a -CH₂- group) or different splitting patterns.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
