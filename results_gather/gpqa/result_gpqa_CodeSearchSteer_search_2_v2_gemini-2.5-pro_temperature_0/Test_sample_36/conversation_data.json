    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product E and the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\nThis reaction involves the protection of the carbonyl group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) using 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH) with a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃). This forms a cyclic thioacetal, specifically a 1,3-dithiolane.\n*   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\nButyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in molecule A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2) is acidic due to the stabilizing effect of the adjacent sulfur atoms on the resulting carbanion.\n*   **Product B:** The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\nThe carbanion (B) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction, adding a second ethyl group to the C2 position.\n*   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\nThis step is the deprotection of the thioacetal group using mercuric chloride (HgCl₂) in the presence of water and acid. This hydrolysis reaction regenerates a carbonyl group, yielding a ketone.\n*   **Product D:** 3-Pentanone (diethyl ketone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O)\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\nThis is a Wittig reaction. First, the Wittig reagent is prepared from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) and 3-bromopentane.\n1.  **Phosphonium salt formation:** PPh₃ reacts with 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) to form (pentan-3-yl)triphenylphosphonium bromide.\n2.  **Ylide formation:** The strong base BuLi deprotonates the carbon attached to the phosphorus, forming the phosphorus ylide: (pentan-3-ylidene)triphenylphosphorane, Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n\nThe ylide then reacts with the ketone from the previous step (D, 3-pentanone). The Wittig reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen of the ketone with the carbon part of the ylide.\n*   **Reaction:** (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O\n*   **Product E:** 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene\n\n**13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nThe structure of the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, is:\n\n```\n      CH₂-CH₃\n      |\nCH₃-CH₂-C = C-CH₂-CH₃\n          |\n          CH₂-CH₃\n```\n\nThis molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry that bisects the central carbon-carbon double bond. Due to this symmetry, several carbon atoms are chemically equivalent:\n\n1.  **Olefinic carbons:** The two carbons forming the double bond (C=C) are in identical chemical environments. This results in one signal.\n2.  **Methylene carbons (CH₂):** All four methylene groups (-CH₂-) are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This results in a second signal.\n3.  **Methyl carbons (CH₃):** All four methyl groups (-CH₃) are also equivalent. This results in a third signal.\n\nTherefore, the 13C-NMR spectrum of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene will show a total of 3 signals.\n\n<<<C>>>"
