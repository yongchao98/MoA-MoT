    "To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, the data from each characterization technique must be analyzed.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. This broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch (1650-1750 cm⁻¹). Specifically, carboxylic acids show an intense band between 1760-1690 cm⁻¹.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which typically occurs in the 1680-1640 cm⁻¹ region.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinylic protons typically appear in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of the spectrum.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment (mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n### Degree of Unsaturation\n\nThe combined spectroscopic data suggest the presence of both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This requires two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O double bond in the carboxyl group and one for the C=C double bond.\n\nThe degree of unsaturation for each possible formula can be calculated using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula accommodates two degrees of unsaturation and has two oxygen atoms, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This allows for only one double bond or ring, which contradicts the evidence for both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation and only one oxygen, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid containing a C=C bond.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. While this has the correct degree of unsaturation, it only has one oxygen atom, which is not enough for a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe evidence from all three analytical techniques points to a molecule with the formula C₆H₁₀O₂. This is the only option that contains two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and has two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the carbonyl (C=O) and the vinyl (C=C) groups confirmed by the spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
