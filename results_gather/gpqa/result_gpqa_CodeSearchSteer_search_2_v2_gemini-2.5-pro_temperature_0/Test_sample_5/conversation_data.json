    "To find the energy spectrum for a particle in the given potential, we first need to express the potential in Cartesian coordinates and then solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation.\n\n**1. Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe given potential is:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nWe use the standard conversions from polar (r, θ) to Cartesian (x, y) coordinates:\n*   r² = x² + y²\n*   x = r cos(θ)\n\nFrom the second relation, we have cos(θ) = x/r, and therefore cos²(θ) = x²/r² = x² / (x² + y²).\n\nNow, substitute these into the potential equation:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(x² + y²) * [x² / (x² + y²)]\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\n**2. Analyze the Schrödinger Equation**\n\nThe potential is now separated into two independent terms, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\nV(x, y) = Vₓ(x) + Vᵧ(y)\nwhere:\n*   Vₓ(x) = 2kx² = 1/2 (4k)x²\n*   Vᵧ(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\nThis is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is separable. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies from the x and y dimensions: E = Eₓ + Eᵧ.\n\n**3. Solve for the Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe energy for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form V(q) = 1/2 mω²q² is given by:\nEₙ = (n + 1/2)ħω, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    We compare Vₓ(x) = 1/2 (4k)x² with the general form V(x) = 1/2 mωₓ²x².\n    This gives mωₓ² = 4k, so the angular frequency is ωₓ = √(4k/m) = 2√(k/m).\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-direction are:\n    Eₙₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħωₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħ * 2√(k/m) = (2nₓ + 1)ħ√(k/m)\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    We compare Vᵧ(y) = 1/2 ky² with the general form V(y) = 1/2 mωᵧ²y².\n    This gives mωᵧ² = k, so the angular frequency is ωᵧ = √(k/m).\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-direction are:\n    Eₙᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħωᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies for the two independent oscillators:\nE = Eₙₓ + Eₙᵧ\nE = (2nₓ + 1)ħ√(k/m) + (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\nE = [(2nₓ + 1) + (nᵧ + 1/2)] ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + nᵧ + 3/2) ħ√(k/m)\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
