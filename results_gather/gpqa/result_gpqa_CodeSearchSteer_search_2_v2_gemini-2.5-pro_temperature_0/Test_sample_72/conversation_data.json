    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n### 1. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts moving in the same direction, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let `v1` be the velocity of the first astronaut (0.6c) and `v2` be the velocity of the second astronaut (0.5c).\n\nThe formula is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nPlugging in the values:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.30)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.70`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic system is the sum of the individual total energies of its components. The total energy `E` of a single particle is given by `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe Lorentz factor `γ` is calculated as:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c):**\n\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ1`):\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / 0.8`\n    `γ1 = 1.25`\n\n*   Calculate the energy (`E1`):\n    `E1 = γ1 * (2m) * c^2`\n    `E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c^2`\n    `E1 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, velocity 0.5c):**\n\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ2`):\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n    `γ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866`\n    `γ2 ≈ 1.1547`\n\n*   Calculate the energy (`E2`):\n    `E2 = γ2 * (3m) * c^2`\n    `E2 ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c^2`\n    `E2 ≈ 3.464 mc^2`\n\n**Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n\n*   `E_total = E1 + E2`\n*   `E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2`\n*   `E_total ≈ 5.964 mc^2`\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc^2**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   Total energy `E ≈ 5.96 mc^2`\n\nThese results match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
