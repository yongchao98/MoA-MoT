    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance.\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. For a planet in a circular orbit, this temperature is related to its distance from the star. The energy received from the star decreases with the square of the distance (D). The energy radiated by the planet is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T⁴).\n\nIn equilibrium, the power absorbed equals the power radiated. This leads to the relationship that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance.\n\n*   **T_eq ∝ 1 / √D**\n\nThis can also be written as:\n\n*   **(T_eq_i / T_eq_j)² = D_j / D_i**\n\nWhere 'i' and 'j' represent two different planets orbiting the same star. The problem states the orbits are circular, so the orbital distance 'D' is the semi-major axis 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: Use the given temperature ratios to find the ratios of the orbital distances.\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of the orbital distances for Planet 2 to Planet 1 (a2/a1):\n*   (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = a2 / a1\n*   (1.4)² = a2 / a1\n*   **a2 / a1 = 1.96**\n\nNext, let's find the ratio of the orbital distances for Planet 3 to Planet 2 (a3/a2):\n*   (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² = a3 / a2\n*   (2.3)² = a3 / a2\n*   **a3 / a2 = 5.29**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1.\nTo find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet 3 to Planet 1, we first need the ratio of their orbital distances (a3/a1). We can find this by multiplying the intermediate ratios:\n*   a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1)\n*   a3 / a1 = 5.29 * 1.96\n*   **a3 / a1 = 10.3684**\n\n### Step 4: Apply Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of the orbital periods.\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For two planets orbiting the same star, this can be expressed as:\n\n*   **(P_i / P_j)² = (a_i / a_j)³**\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n\n*   **P_i / P_j = (a_i / a_j)^(3/2)**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet 3 to that of Planet 1 (P3/P1):\n*   P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)\n*   P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(1.5)\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the final value.\nNow, we calculate the final numerical answer:\n*   P3 / P1 = (10.3684) * √10.3684\n*   P3 / P1 ≈ 10.3684 * 3.22\n*   **P3 / P1 ≈ 33.43**\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the planets' masses and the albedo value (as long as it's consistent for all planets) is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
