    "The reaction involves the ring-opening of a substituted epoxide by an organocuprate, specifically a Gilman reagent (Me2CuLi). The fundamental principles governing this reaction are key to determining the correct product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a bicyclic compound where an epoxide ring is fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring.\n    *   **Reagent**: Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi). This reagent acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and, in reactions with epoxides, they attack the less sterically hindered carbon atom.\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by the oxygen atom and carbons C1 and C6 of the bicyclic system.\n    *   Carbon C1 is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group and three other carbons (C2, C5, and C6).\n    *   Carbon C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen and three other carbons (C1, C2, and C5).\n    *   Comparing the two, C6 is the less sterically hindered position. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The ring-opening of epoxides by organocuprates proceeds via an Sₙ2-type mechanism. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond (anti-attack), leading to an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n    *   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6.\n    *   This causes an inversion of the stereochemistry at C6. The starting material has a (6S) configuration. After the reaction, this center will have an (R) configuration.\n    *   The stereocenter at C1 is not involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming step with the nucleophile, so its configuration (1R) is retained.\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are also unaffected, so their configurations (3R, 4R) are retained.\n\n### Determining the Product Structure\n\n*   **Attack at C6**: The methyl group adds to C6.\n*   **Ring Opening**: The C6-O bond breaks, and the C1-O bond becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH) after an aqueous workup (which is implicit in this type of reaction).\n*   **Resulting Structure**: The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with methyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 4 from the original molecule, plus a new methyl group at the site of attack (C6).\n*   **IUPAC Naming of the Product**:\n    *   The carbon bearing the -OH group is C1. This carbon also has a methyl group.\n    *   The adjacent carbon that was attacked (originally C6) is now C2. It has the newly added methyl group.\n    *   The original C4 is still C4.\n    *   The original C3 is now C5.\n    *   The product is named 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n### Determining the Product Stereochemistry\n\n*   **C1**: Configuration is retained as (R).\n*   **C2 (from C6)**: Configuration inverts from (S) to (R).\n*   **C4 (from C4)**: Configuration is retained as (R).\n*   **C5 (from C3)**: Configuration is retained as (R).\n\nCombining these, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nB) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nC) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nD) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe calculated product matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
