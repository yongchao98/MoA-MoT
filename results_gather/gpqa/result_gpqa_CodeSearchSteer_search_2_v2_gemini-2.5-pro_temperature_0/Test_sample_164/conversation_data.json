    "To determine the correct statement regarding the formation of a branched polymer from ethylene using a dual-catalyst system, each statement must be evaluated based on established chemical principles and industrial practices.\n\nThe core of the proposed process is a tandem catalytic system where one catalyst oligomerizes ethylene into short-chain linear alpha-olefins (like 1-hexene or 1-octene), and a second catalyst copolymerizes these *in situ* generated alpha-olefins with the remaining ethylene to create a branched polymer, specifically linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE).\n\n**A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\nResearch and patents from major chemical companies based in the US, such as Dow Chemical, describe dual-catalyst systems for producing LLDPE with improved properties. These developments and the existence of related technologies like the Borstar process, which uses reactors in series to achieve similar bimodal polymer structures, indicate that tandem catalysis is an industrially relevant and applied technology.\n\n**B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\nThe \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene to form the α-olefin branches. Aluminum-based activators, particularly methylaluminoxane (MAO) and other alkylaluminum compounds, are widely and effectively used to activate the transition metal catalysts (based on iron, chromium, etc.) that perform this oligomerization. Multiple studies confirm that these activators are often crucial for the catalytic cycle. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n**C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\nGroup VIa (more commonly known as Group 6) includes chromium (Cr). Chromium-based catalysts are well-known and highly effective for the selective oligomerization of ethylene, particularly for trimerization into 1-hexene. These catalysts, such as those based on CrCl₃, are used in conjunction with activators like MAO to achieve high selectivity for the desired α-olefin, which then acts as the comonomer. This makes the statement factually correct and highly relevant to creating the described polymer.\n\n**D) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\nNoble metals like palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) have been shown to catalyze the oligomerization of ethylene. However, for the production of a high-volume commodity polymer like polyethylene, the high cost of noble metals is a significant economic barrier. Industrial processes strongly favor catalysts based on more abundant and less expensive metals such as chromium, iron, titanium, and zirconium. Thus, while technically possible, using noble metal catalysts is not economically viable for this application, making this statement correct.\n\n**Conclusion**\nStatements A, C, and D appear to be correct, while B is definitively incorrect. However, the question asks for the single correct statement in the context of providing practical advice to a scientist.\n*   Statement B is factually wrong.\n*   Statements A, C, and D are factually correct.\nBut let's analyze the context. The scientist wants to *design* a system.\n*   Statement C provides a direct, actionable piece of chemical advice: \"One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal...\". This is a positive and constructive suggestion pointing to a well-established method.\n*   Statement D points out a possibility but immediately dismisses it as too expensive, which is less constructive for designing a new system.\n*   Statement A is a commercial fact, not a technical instruction for the scientist's lab work.\n\nGiven the context of a scientist seeking technical guidance, the most appropriate and accurate statement that provides a direct path forward is C. It describes a valid and widely researched catalytic approach for the desired transformation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
