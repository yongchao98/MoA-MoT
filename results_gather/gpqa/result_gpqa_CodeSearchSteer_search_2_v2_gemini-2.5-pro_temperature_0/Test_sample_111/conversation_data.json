    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Normalize the state |α>**:\n    The given state is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. Let's call this unnormalized state `|α'>`.\n    To normalize it, we must ensure that the inner product `<α|α>` is equal to 1.\n    First, calculate the norm squared of `|α'>`:\n    `<α'|α'> = <(1+i)up + (2-i)down | (1+i)up + (2-i)down>`\n    This expands to `(1-i)(1+i)<up|up> + (2+i)(2-i)<down|down>`.\n    Since `|1+i|² = 1² + 1² = 2` and `|2-i|² = 2² + (-1)² = 5`, and `<up|up> = <down|down> = 1`, the norm squared is `2 + 5 = 7`.\n    The normalization constant is `1/√7`.\n    Therefore, the normalized state is:\n    `|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\n2.  **Define the operator A and find its eigenstates and eigenvalues**:\n    The operator A is defined by the matrix elements `Aij = ħ/2` if `i ≠ j` and `0` otherwise. In the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, this gives the matrix:\n    `A = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n    This is proportional to the Pauli matrix σₓ.\n\n    To find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n    `det([[-λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]]) = λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0`\n    This gives two eigenvalues: `λ₁ = +ħ/2` and `λ₂ = -ħ/2`.\n\n    Now, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\n    *   For `λ₁ = +ħ/2`, the eigenvector equation `A|v₁> = λ₁|v₁>` gives `a = b`. The normalized eigenstate is `|v₁> = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n    *   For `λ₂ = -ħ/2`, the eigenvector equation `A|v₂> = λ₂|v₂>` gives `b = -a`. The normalized eigenstate is `|v₂> = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the probabilities**:\n    The probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|vᵢ>` is given by `Pᵢ = |<vᵢ|α>|²`.\n\n    *   **Probability for `λ₁ = +ħ/2` (state `|v₁>`)**:\n        `P₁ = |<v₁|α>|² = |(1/√2)*(<up| + <down|) * (1/√7)*((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)|²`\n        `P₁ = (1/14) * |(1+i) + (2-i)|² = (1/14) * |3|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n\n    *   **Probability for `λ₂ = -ħ/2` (state `|v₂>`)**:\n        `P₂ = |<v₂|α>|² = |(1/√2)*(<up| - <down|) * (1/√7)*((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)|²`\n        `P₂ = (1/14) * |(1+i) - (2-i)|² = (1/14) * |-1 + 2i|² = (1/14) * ((-1)² + 2²) = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\n\n    The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n4.  **Calculate the average value of the operator A**:\n    The average (or expectation) value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Using probabilities and eigenvalues**:\n        `<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂`\n        `<A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5) = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7`\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using the definition `<A> = <α|A|α>`**:\n        First, `A|α> = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/√7) * [(1+i), (2-i)]ᵀ = (ħ/(2√7)) * [(2-i), (1+i)]ᵀ`\n        Then, `<A> = <α|A|α> = (1/√7) * [(1-i), (2+i)] * (ħ/(2√7)) * [(2-i), (1+i)]ᵀ`\n        `<A> = (ħ/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n        `<A> = (ħ/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)] = (ħ/14) * [1 - 3i + 1 + 3i] = 2ħ/14 = ħ/7`\n\nBoth methods yield the same average value, `ħ/7`.\n\nComparing our results (Probabilities ≈ 0.64, 0.36 and Average Value = ħ/7) with the given options, we find that option C is the correct one.\n\n<<<C>>>"
