    "Here is a breakdown of the two reactions to determine the appropriate reagents:\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate. Reagent A is needed to protonate this intermediate to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group. An acidic workup, represented by H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion), is typically used for this protonation step. While sometimes HCN is generated *in situ* by adding a strong acid to NaCN, an acidic workup is a standard and effective method to ensure the formation of the cyanohydrin product.\n\n*   **Reagent A:** H₃O⁺\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be catalyzed by either acid or base, but it is typically carried out by heating the nitrile with a strong acid or base. Among the given options, HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and a common reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and would be much less effective for this conversion.\n\n*   **Reagent B:** HCl\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions, the correct set of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<D>>>"
