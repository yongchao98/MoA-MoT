    "To determine the required Lorentz factor, we can use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and the exponential nature of particle decay.\n\nThe fraction of particles, N/N₀, that survive after a time `t` in the laboratory's frame of reference is given by the formula:\n\nN/N₀ = e<sup>(-t / τ_lab)</sup>\n\nHere, τ_lab is the particle's average lifetime as measured in the lab. This lifetime is dilated due to relativistic effects and is related to the particle's proper lifetime (τ₀, its lifetime in its own rest frame) and its Lorentz factor (γ) by the equation: τ_lab = γ * τ₀.\n\nThe time `t` it takes for the particles to travel from the center to the inner wall of the detector is the radius (R) divided by the particle's velocity (v). Since the particles are described as \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity is extremely close to the speed of light (c), so we can approximate `t ≈ R/c`.\n\nCombining these relationships, the survival fraction can be expressed as:\n\nN/N₀ = e<sup>-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀)</sup>\n\nWe can now set up a ratio using the two scenarios given in the problem.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (N₁/N₀) = 1/3\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₁) = 20\n\nPlugging these into the equation:\n1/3 = e<sup>-(R/c) / (20 * τ₀)</sup>\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\nln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ₀)\n-ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ₀)\nln(3) = (R/c) / (20 * τ₀)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (N₂/N₀) = 2/3\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₂) = ?\n\nPlugging these values in:\n2/3 = e<sup>-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)</sup>\n\nTaking the natural logarithm:\nln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)\n-ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)\nln(3/2) = (R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations. We can solve for the term (R/c) / τ₀ in the first equation and substitute it into the second.\n\nFrom the first scenario:\n(R/c) / τ₀ = 20 * ln(3)\n\nSubstitute this into the equation from the second scenario:\nln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\nNow, we solve for the new Lorentz factor, γ₂:\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986) / (0.4055)\nγ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
