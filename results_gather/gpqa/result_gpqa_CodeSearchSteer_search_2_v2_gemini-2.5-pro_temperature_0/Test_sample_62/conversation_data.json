    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Model and Energy Levels\n\nThe problem specifies a diatomic molecule (X-Y) that can be described by the quantum rotation-vibration model. The total energy of the molecule in a given state is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies.\n\nThe energy for a specific rovibrational state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (J = 0, 1, 2, ...), is given by the formula:\n\n**E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B·J(J + 1)**\n\nWhere:\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **ω** is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   **B** is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2I).\n*   **I** is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n### 2. Identify the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers, so **v = 0** and **J = 0**.\n*   **Final State:** The problem asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This phrasing can be ambiguous. It could mean the state with the absolute next-highest energy level, or it could refer to the most common type of transition studied in this context, which is a rovibrational transition.\n\nLet's analyze the possible transitions and their energies:\n*   **Pure Rotational Transition:** (v=0, J=0) → (v=0, J=1). The energy for this would be very low and typically falls in the microwave region of the spectrum.\n*   **Rovibrational Transition:** This involves a change in both `v` and `J`. For infrared absorption, the selection rules for a diatomic molecule are **Δv = +1** and **ΔJ = ±1**. Starting from J=0, a transition with ΔJ = -1 is not possible. Therefore, the only allowed rovibrational transition from the ground state is to a state where **v = 1** and **J = 1**.\n\nBy examining the magnitude of the given options, it becomes clear that the question is referring to a rovibrational transition, as the calculated momentum for a pure rotational transition is several orders of magnitude smaller than any of the choices.\n\nSo, the transition is: **(v=0, J=0) → (v=1, J=1)**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Photon Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\n*   **E_initial** = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B·0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   **E_final** = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B·1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\nThe energy difference is:\n**ΔE** = E_final - E_initial = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ] = **ħω + 2B**\n\nSubstituting B = ħ² / (2I), we get:\n**ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Numerical Values\n\nFirst, we need the moment of inertia, I = μR², where μ is the reduced mass.\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    Using the conversion 1 amu ≈ 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg:\n    μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μR²\n    I = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰ m²) ≈ 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\nNow, we can calculate the two parts of the energy ΔE.\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy Term (ħω):**\n    Using ħ ≈ 1.0546 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s:\n    ħω = (1.0546 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n*   **Rotational Energy Term (ħ²/I):**\n    ħ²/I = (1.0546 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\n    ħ²/I ≈ (1.1122 x 10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s²) / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.21 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n*   **Total Photon Energy (ΔE):**\n    ΔE = (4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.21 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 4.227 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n### 5. Calculate the Photon Momentum (p)\n\nThe relationship between a photon's energy (E) and momentum (p) is E = pc, where c is the speed of light (c ≈ 2.998 x 10⁸ m/s).\n\n*   **Momentum (p):**\n    p = ΔE / c\n    p = (4.227 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s)\n    p ≈ 1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis value is very close to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
