    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points.\n\n### 1. Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n\n*   **Initial Concentration (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Concentration (M₂):** Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\nSo, the concentration of the acetic acid to be titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), by the NaOH. This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH of a buffer solution.\n    **pH = pKa + log ([Conjugate Base] / [Weak Acid])**\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵ (The Ka for acetic acid is commonly cited as 1.8 x 10⁻⁵ or 1.75 x 10⁻⁵, but we will use the value given in the problem).\n    *   pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base [CH₃COO⁻] to the weak acid [CH₃COOH] is 25/75, or 1/3.\n*   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   **pH ≈ 4.256**\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, which is a weak base.\n\n*   **Reaction:** CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Step A: Find the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]).**\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equals the initial moles of acid (0.001 mol).\n    *   Volume of NaOH added = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L or 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total volume of the solution = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ or 0.050 L.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   **Step B: Calculate the concentration of hydroxide ions ([OH⁻]).**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion. We can calculate this from the Ka of acetic acid and the ion-product constant for water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C).\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n        *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n        *   x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n        *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Step C: Calculate the pH.**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483\n    *   **pH ≈ 8.517**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ **4.26**\n*   pH at equivalence point ≈ **8.52**\n\nThese values correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
