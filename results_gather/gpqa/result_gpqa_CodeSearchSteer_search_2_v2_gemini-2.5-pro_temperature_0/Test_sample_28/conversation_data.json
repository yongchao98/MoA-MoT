    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the most effective strategy is to \"knock out\" the gene responsible for its synthesis. This means introducing a mutation that renders the protein produced by the gene non-functional. Let's analyze the effects of each mutation.\n\nThe intact gene's initial codons are:\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\nThis translates to the amino acid sequence:\nMet - Phe - Leu - Ala...\n\nNow let's examine the mutants:\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The codons are `ATG` (Met), `TTC` (Phe), and `TAC` (Tyr).\n    *   This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid (Leucine) is replaced by another (Tyrosine). While this might alter the protein's function, it doesn't guarantee it will be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The codons are `ATG` (Met), `TTC` (Phe), and `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes translation to halt prematurely, resulting in a very short, truncated protein (only two amino acids long). A nonsense mutation that occurs so early in the gene sequence is highly likely to produce a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains multiple amino acid changes compared to the original.\n    *   This represents multiple **missense mutations**. Like Mutant 1, it results in a full-length protein with some altered amino acids. This might affect function, but it is less certain to eliminate it entirely compared to a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Comparing this to the intact gene, a missense mutation has occurred (`CTC` to `TAC`), and the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n    *   Since a full codon (three bases) was removed, the reading frame is not shifted. This is an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another substituted (Leucine to Tyrosine). This is less likely to completely abolish protein function than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most effective mutation for eliminating the function of a protein is the one that prevents a full-length, functional version from being made. The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop signal at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This is the most probable option to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
