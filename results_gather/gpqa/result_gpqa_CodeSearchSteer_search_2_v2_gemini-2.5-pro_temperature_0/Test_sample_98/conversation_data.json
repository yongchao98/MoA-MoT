    "To identify the unknown compound, we must analyze the provided spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR) and match it to one of the four possible structures.\n\n### Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nThe FTIR data confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. Since all four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, the FTIR data is consistent with all of them. Therefore, we must rely on the 1H NMR data to distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### Analysis of 1H NMR Data\n\nThe key information from the 1H NMR spectrum lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicities) of two specific signals:\n1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nThis means we need to find a molecule that has two different protons with these specific environments. Let's analyze the structure of each candidate. The structures provided in options B and C contain a carbon atom with five bonds, which is chemically impossible. Assuming these are typographical errors and the intended structures are the correspondingly named acids, we will proceed with the analysis. The most plausible candidates that could exhibit such complex splitting are C and D due to their multiple chiral centers and varied adjacent groups.\n\nLet's analyze the protons on the carbon backbone for candidates C and D, as these are most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n#### Candidate D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)\n\nLet's label the key protons in the structure:\n```\n      H(a)   H(b)\n      |      |\nCH₃(d)-CH₂(c)-CH(b)-CH(a)-COOH\n             |      |\n             CH₃(f) CH₃(e)\n```\n\n*   **Analysis of H(b) at position C3:**\n    *   It is coupled to the single proton **H(a)** at C2, which splits the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   It is coupled to the two protons of the methylene group **CH₂(c)** at C4, which splits the signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n    *   It is coupled to the three protons of the methyl group **CH₃(f)** attached to C3, which splits the signal into a **quartet (q)**.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the signals described in the problem.\n\n*   **Analysis for a `dtt` signal:**\n    *   A doublet of triplets of triplets requires a proton to be coupled to three different neighboring groups: one with a single proton, one with two protons, and a third with two protons.\n    *   Let's examine other protons in molecule D. The proton H(a) is coupled to H(b) (1H) and the methyl group CH₃(e) (3H), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The diastereotopic protons of the CH₂(c) group would each be split by H(b) (1H), their geminal partner (1H), and the CH₃(d) group (3H), resulting in a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq).\n    *   Molecule D does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n#### Candidate C: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)\n\nLet's label the key protons in the structure:\n```\n      H(a)   H(b)\n      |      |\nCH₃(d)-CH₂(c)-CH(b)-CH(a)-COOH\n             |      |\n           Et(g)  Et(e)  (where Et is -CH₂CH₃)\n```\n\n*   **Analysis of H(b) at position C3:**\n    *   It is coupled to the single proton **H(a)** at C2, which splits the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   It is coupled to the two protons of the methylene group **CH₂(c)** at C4, which splits the signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n    *   It is coupled to the two protons of the methylene group within the ethyl substituent **Et(g)**, which splits the signal into another **triplet (t)**.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the other signal described in the problem.\n\n*   **Analysis for a `dtq` signal:**\n    *   A doublet of triplets of quartets requires a proton to be coupled to a single proton, a group of two protons, and a group of three protons.\n    *   Let's examine other protons in molecule C. The proton H(a) is coupled to H(b) (1H) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group Et(e) (2H), resulting in a doublet of triplets (dt). The diastereotopic protons of the various CH₂ groups (at C4, and in each ethyl group) would result in doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq), not a `dtq`.\n    *   Molecule C does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtq` signal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR splitting patterns:\n*   Molecule **D (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)** is predicted to show a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** for the proton at C3.\n*   Molecule **C (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)** is predicted to show a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** for the proton at C3.\n\nThe problem states that the spectrum of the unknown compound shows *both* of these signals. This indicates that the unknown sample is not a single pure compound but rather a mixture of compound C and compound D. However, since the question asks to identify the compound as one of the options, and each option represents a single compound, there is a flaw in the premise of the question.\n\nIf forced to choose the \"best\" answer or if there is an error in the problem statement where only one of these complex signals is truly present and correctly identified, we cannot definitively select one compound over the other as both are partially supported by the data.\n\nHowever, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, it is common for one of the options to be the intended answer despite potential ambiguities. Given that both complex splitting patterns are explicitly mentioned, and each is uniquely characteristic of one of the molecules (C and D), it is impossible to select a single correct structure from the list provided. If we assume there is a typo and only one of the splitting patterns is correct, we cannot know which one.\n\nGiven the constraints and the detailed analysis, no single option can account for all the provided data. But if we must choose the compound that gives the `dtq` and `dtt` signals, and we have found that D gives the `dtq` and C gives the `dtt`, the question is unanswerable as stated. Let's re-evaluate D as the most likely intended answer, as `dtq` is a very distinct pattern.\n\nLet's assume the question is asking to identify the compound that is **most likely** described, and there might be an error in reporting one of the signals. Both C and D are highly complex molecules that would produce multiple overlapping multiplets. The proton at C3 in molecule D gives a clear `dtq` signal, which is a very specific pattern. The proton at C3 in molecule C gives a clear `dtt` signal. Without further information or clarification, a definitive choice is not possible. However, if a single choice must be made, and acknowledging the ambiguity, we select the structure that provides the first, and arguably more complex, described signal.\n\nLet's reconsider the possibility of both signals in one molecule. The analysis holds that D gives a `dtq` and C gives a `dtt`, but neither gives both. Therefore, the question is flawed. However, in the context of a test, if a choice must be made, there might be an intended answer. Let's assume the question is valid and re-examine D.\n\n**Revisiting D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n- H at C3: Coupled to H at C2 (d), CH₂ at C4 (t), CH₃ at C3 (q) -> **dtq**. (Confirmed)\n- Is there any way to get a `dtt`? No proton is adjacent to one H, a CH₂, and another CH₂.\n\nLet's assume the question is about compound D.\n\nFinal consideration: The problem is fundamentally flawed as no single compound listed produces both signals. However, if a single answer must be selected, this is a guess. Let's stick to the most rigorous analysis: D provides the `dtq` and C provides the `dtt`. The question asks for a compound that has both. No such compound is listed. Let's assume the question meant to ask which compound gives a `dtq` signal, pointing towards D.\n\nGiven the options and the detailed analysis, molecule D, 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid, is the only one that produces a doublet of triplets of quartets. Molecule C is the only one that produces a doublet of triplets of triplets. Since the problem states the compound exhibits both, it implies a mixture or a flawed question. If we are forced to choose the structure that gives the most uniquely described and complex signal (`dtq`), D would be a plausible guess.\n\nLet's assume the question is correct and my analysis is wrong. Where could the error be? Perhaps long-range coupling? It's unlikely to be strong enough to create these clean, high-order multiplets. The most straightforward interpretation (1st-order rules) leads to the conclusion that D gives a `dtq` and C gives a `dtt`.\n\nLet's choose D based on the presence of the `dtq` signal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
