    "### Analysis of Optical Isomerism in the Given Compounds:\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common source of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or an axis of chirality, as seen in some substituted biphenyls (atropisomerism).\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. For a biphenyl to be chiral, there must be bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') that restrict free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. In this case, the nitro groups (-NO₂) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃) at the 6,6' and 2,2' positions, respectively, are bulky enough to prevent rotation. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as it lacks a plane of symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers (D and L forms) and is optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. It does not have a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings, making it achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule has a double bond, which restricts rotation, leading to geometrical isomerism (cis/trans). However, dimethyl fumarate itself is a symmetrical molecule. It has a center of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
