    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic (50:50) mixture of enantiomers. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The entire molecule is planar, meaning it has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name of this complex bicyclic compound includes specific stereochemical descriptors ((3aR,7aS,E)). This indicates that a single, specific stereoisomer is being described. Such a molecule is chiral, and as a single enantiomer, it will be optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two stereocenters. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with a center of inversion, which means it is achiral. This specific isomer is known as a meso compound and is optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and is therefore a chiral molecule. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at the first carbon, which is a stereocenter. The four groups attached to this carbon are -H, -OH, and two different carbon pathways around the ring (-CH=CH- and -CH2-CH2-). The designation of a single enantiomer ((R)) means the compound is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This notation describes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon atom bisects the molecule into two mirror-image halves. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** To check for chirality, we look for a carbon atom with four different groups attached. The structure is (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. No carbon in this molecule is a chiral center. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH2- group, and two identical methyl groups. Since it does not have four different substituents, it is not a chiral center. The molecule lacks a chiral center and is achiral, thus it is not optically active.\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
