    "A dominant-negative mutation produces a mutant protein that interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced from the normal allele. This is particularly common in proteins that must form dimers or larger complexes to be functional. In a heterozygous individual, both wild-type and mutant proteins are produced. The mutant protein can form a dimer with the wild-type protein, creating a non-functional or \"poisoned\" complex.\n\nLet's analyze the options based on this mechanism:\n\n*   **A) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation results in a mutant, not a wild-type, phenotype. Also, the mechanism often involves the formation of faulty dimers rather than a complete loss of dimerization.\n*   **B) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation is a type of loss-of-function mutation, not a gain-of-function.\n*   **C) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While protein aggregation can be a consequence of some mutations and lead to a dominant-negative effect, it is not the most universally applicable mechanism. A more common mechanism involves the formation of non-functional heterodimers that may or may not aggregate.\n*   **D) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This is a very plausible and common mechanism for a dominant-negative effect. When the mutant protein dimerizes with the wild-type protein, the resulting abnormal complex can be recognized by the cell's quality control machinery (like the ER-associated protein degradation pathway) and targeted for destruction. This process degrades the wild-type protein along with the mutant one, effectively causing a loss of function of the wild-type allele and leading to a more severe phenotype than a simple loss-of-function mutation (haploinsufficiency).\n\nTherefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is that the mutant Y protein dimerizes with the wild-type protein, and this faulty heterodimer is targeted for degradation, leading to a loss of function of the wild-type protein.\n\n<<<D>>>"
