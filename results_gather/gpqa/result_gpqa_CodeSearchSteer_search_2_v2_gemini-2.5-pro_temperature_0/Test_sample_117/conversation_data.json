    "The reaction between an enol and bromine is a classic example of alpha-halogenation. The starting material, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, is an enol, which is the less stable tautomer of a ketone. Enols are electron-rich and act as nucleophiles, readily reacting with electrophiles like bromine (Br₂).\n\nThe mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  The pi bond of the enol attacks one of the bromine atoms in the Br₂ molecule.\n2.  This forms a new carbon-bromine bond at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the one bearing the hydroxyl group). In this case, the alpha-carbon is C2.\n3.  An intermediate oxonium ion is formed.\n4.  This intermediate is then deprotonated to regenerate the stable carbonyl group (C=O).\n\nThe overall result is the substitution of a hydrogen atom at the alpha-position with a bromine atom, and the enol tautomerizes to its more stable keto form. Therefore, the hydroxyl group at C1 becomes a carbonyl group, and a bromine atom attaches to C2.\n\nThe starting molecule is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The reaction yields 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n*   A) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: Bromination occurs at the wrong carbon.\n*   B) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: This would be the product of an electrophilic addition across the double bond, which is not the major pathway for an enol. The alpha-halogenation to form a stable ketone is favored.\n*   C) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: This is the correct alpha-haloketone formed from the reaction.\n*   D) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: This is also a product of electrophilic addition and not the major product.\n\nThus, the major outcome is the formation of the alpha-bromoketone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
