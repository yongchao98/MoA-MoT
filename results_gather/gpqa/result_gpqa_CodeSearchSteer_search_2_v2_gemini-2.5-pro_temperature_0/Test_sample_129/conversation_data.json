    "To determine the lower limit on the redshift for detecting Lyman-alpha absorption from neutral hydrogen clouds with ground-based optical telescopes, we need to consider the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line and the atmospheric cutoff at which ground-based telescopes can operate.\n\n### Key Wavelengths\n\n*   **Lyman-alpha (Lyα) Rest Wavelength**: The Lyα transition corresponds to an electron in a hydrogen atom moving from the n=2 to the n=1 energy level. This occurs at a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å), or 121.6 nanometers (nm). This wavelength falls within the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n*   **Atmospheric Cutoff**: The Earth's atmosphere, primarily due to ozone, absorbs most of the incoming ultraviolet radiation. This creates a cutoff, preventing ground-based telescopes from observing wavelengths shorter than about 310-320 nm (3100-3200 Å). Therefore, for a spectral line to be detected from the ground, it must be redshifted to a wavelength longer than this cutoff.\n\n### Redshift Calculation\n\nThe relationship between the rest wavelength (λ_rest), the observed wavelength (λ_observed), and redshift (z) is given by the formula:\n`z = (λ_observed - λ_rest) / λ_rest`\n\nTo find the minimum redshift, we must use the minimum observable wavelength, which is the atmospheric cutoff.\n\n1.  **Set the values**:\n    *   λ_rest = 1216 Å\n    *   λ_observed_min ≈ 3200 Å (a conservative estimate for the atmospheric cutoff)\n\n2.  **Calculate the minimum redshift (z_min)**:\n    *   `z_min = (3200 Å - 1216 Å) / 1216 Å`\n    *   `z_min = 1984 / 1216`\n    *   `z_min ≈ 1.63`\n\nSome sources indicate that direct ground-based observations of neutral hydrogen via the Lyman-alpha transition are restricted to redshifts of z ≳ 1.7. This aligns well with the calculated value.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's calculate the observed wavelength for each of the given redshift options:\n\n*   **A) z = 1.9**:\n    *   λ_observed = 1216 Å * (1 + 1.9) = 1216 Å * 2.9 = 3526.4 Å. This is above the atmospheric cutoff of ~3200 Å and is therefore detectable.\n*   **B) z = 2.4**:\n    *   λ_observed = 1216 Å * (1 + 2.4) = 1216 Å * 3.4 = 4134.4 Å. This is well within the optical range.\n*   **C) z = 3.0**:\n    *   λ_observed = 1216 Å * (1 + 3.0) = 1216 Å * 4.0 = 4864.0 Å. This is also well within the optical range.\n*   **D) z = 1.2**:\n    *   λ_observed = 1216 Å * (1 + 1.2) = 1216 Å * 2.2 = 2675.2 Å. This wavelength is still in the UV and would be blocked by the atmosphere.\n\nBased on the calculation, a redshift of approximately 1.63 is the absolute minimum required. Of the choices provided, 1.2 is too low. While redshifts of 2.4 and 3.0 would allow for detection, the question asks for the *lower limit*. A redshift of 1.9 shifts the Lyman-alpha line to a wavelength that is clearly above the atmospheric cutoff and is the most appropriate lower limit among the given options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
