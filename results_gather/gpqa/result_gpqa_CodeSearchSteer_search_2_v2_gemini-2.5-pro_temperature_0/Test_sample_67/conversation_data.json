    "The physical process described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the situation:\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):** The particle has a spin magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin angular momentum operator. The magnetic field is **B** = B**ẑ** (in the +Z direction). The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the field, meaning it is in the spin-up state along the Z-axis. This is the lowest energy eigenstate for the initial Hamiltonian H = -γB S_z.\n\n2.  **Change in Hamiltonian (t = 0):** The magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B** = B**ŷ** (in the +Y direction). The new Hamiltonian governing the time evolution of the system is H' = -γB S_y.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution (t > 0):** The initial spin state (spin-up along Z) is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. The spin vector will begin to precess around the new magnetic field direction (+Y). This precession occurs in the X-Z plane.\n\n4.  **Oscillation of ⟨μ_z⟩:** As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate. The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩, will vary sinusoidally.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Frequency:** The rate of this precession is given by the Larmor frequency, ω. The Larmor frequency is directly proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic field B and the gyromagnetic ratio γ. The formula for the angular frequency of precession is ω = γB.\n\nA detailed quantum mechanical calculation confirms this result. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin is found to be ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt). Consequently, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt). The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of *t* inside the cosine function, which is γB.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>"
