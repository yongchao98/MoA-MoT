    "The calculation performed in the thought process is correct. The search results confirm the general principles and values used.\n\n*   **Formation Constant (K_f):** The problem gives K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10^10. Search results confirm that the formation constant for the Ca-EDTA complex is indeed very high, around 10^10 to 10^11. The value of log K_f is often cited as 10.65 or 10.7, which corresponds to K_f = 10^10.65 ≈ 4.5 x 10^10, very close to the given value.\n*   **Dissociation:** The dissociation of a complex is the reverse of its formation. The equilibrium constant for dissociation (K_d), sometimes called the instability constant, is the inverse of the formation constant (K_f).\n*   **Equilibrium Calculation:** The calculation involves setting up an equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n    *   Reaction: CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ (where Y⁴⁻ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA)\n    *   Initial: [CaY²⁻] = 0.02 M, [Ca²⁺] = 0, [Y⁴⁻] = 0\n    *   Change: [CaY²⁻] = -x, [Ca²⁺] = +x, [Y⁴⁻] = +x\n    *   Equilibrium: [CaY²⁻] = 0.02 - x, [Ca²⁺] = x, [Y⁴⁻] = x\n*   **Dissociation Constant (K_d):**\n    *   K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10^10) = 2 x 10^-11\n*   **Equilibrium Expression:**\n    *   K_d = [Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻] / [CaY²⁻]\n    *   2 x 10^-11 = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   **Approximation:** Because K_d is extremely small, the amount of dissociation (x) will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex. Therefore, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n*   **Solving for x:**\n    *   2 x 10^-11 ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ (2 x 10^-11) * 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ 4 x 10^-13\n    *   x = √(4 x 10^-13)\n    *   x = 2 x 10^-6.5\n    *   x ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option D. The problem states the pH is ideal, which simplifies the calculation by allowing the use of the overall formation constant without correcting for the protonation of EDTA.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 2.0x10^-2 M\nB) 5.0x10^-3 M\nC) 1.0x10^-2 M\nD) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
