    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Structure of Compound X from IR and NMR Data\n\n**Analysis of IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\n**Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet in the downfield region is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is further downfield, suggesting it is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an alkyl substituent.\n*   **Alkyl Group Signals:**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet indicates a -CH₃ group coupled to a -CH₂ group (an ethyl fragment).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet points to a -CH₃ group coupled to a single proton (-CH group).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons is consistent with a -CH₂- group, likely coupled to both the -CH at 2.9 ppm and the -CH₃ at 0.9 ppm.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton is characteristic of a -CH group attached to the benzene ring (benzylic position) and also coupled to the adjacent methyl and methylene groups.\n\n**Assembling the Structure:**\nBased on the spectral data, the molecule has a carboxylic acid group and an alkyl group attached in a para arrangement on a benzene ring. The alkyl group is a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)].\n\nTherefore, the structure of **Compound X** is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Reaction and Predict the Final Product\n\n**Reagents:**\nThe reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n**Reaction Type:**\nThis combination of reagents is a very strong reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to the corresponding alkanes (-CH₃). The reaction involves the removal of both oxygen atoms from the carboxyl group and their replacement with hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Applying the Reaction to Compound X:**\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The *sec*-butyl group will remain unchanged.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule will be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy first elucidating the structure of the starting material as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid and then considering the known reactivity of red phosphorus and HI, which reduces carboxylic acids to alkanes, the final product is identified as 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted product.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an incorrect alkyl isomer.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This is an incorrect structure.\n\n<<<B>>>"
