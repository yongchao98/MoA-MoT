    "When solving partial differential equations like the heat equation numerically, a common technique is to first discretize the spatial variables, which transforms the partial differential equation into a large system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The solution to this system involves computing the matrix exponential. For large matrices, this is computationally expensive.\n\nTo create a parallel algorithm, the matrix exponential function is often approximated by a rational function. The key step that allows for parallelization is the decomposition of this rational function into a sum of simpler terms using a partial fraction expansion.\n\nHere's how it works:\n1.  The problem is reduced to calculating `r(A)v`, where `r` is a rational approximation to the exponential function, `A` is the matrix from the discretized PDE, and `v` is a vector.\n2.  The rational function `r(z)` is decomposed into partial fractions: `r(z) = c + Σ [α_i / (z - β_i)]`.\n3.  Applying this to the matrix `A`, the calculation becomes `r(A)v = cv + Σ [α_i * (A - β_i * I)⁻¹ v]`.\n4.  Each term in the summation involves solving a system of linear equations of the form `(A - β_i * I)x_i = v`.\n5.  Crucially, these linear systems are independent of each other and can be solved simultaneously on different processors. The final solution is then a simple linear combination of the results from each processor.\n\nThis technique of using a linear partial fraction decomposition is the essential factor that converts a sequential computational problem into a set of independent tasks suitable for a parallel algorithm.\n\n<<<A>>>"
