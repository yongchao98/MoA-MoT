    "The problem asks to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, ∫(∇ ⋅ f) dV, within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The vector field is given by f(r) = (1/r²) * r̂, where r̂ is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nThis problem can be solved using the Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem. The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the outward flux of the vector field through the closed surface S that encloses the volume.\n\n∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS)\n\nHere, V is the volume of the sphere of radius R, and S is its surface.\n\nThe vector field on the surface of the sphere (where r = R) is f(R) = (1/R²) * r̂.\nThe differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is dS = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂.\n\nThe dot product f ⋅ dS is therefore:\nf ⋅ dS = [(1/R²) * r̂] ⋅ [R² sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂]\nSince r̂ is a unit vector, r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1. The R² terms cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\nf ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nNow, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the polar angle θ are 0 to π, and for the azimuthal angle φ are 0 to 2π.\n\n∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫(from 0 to 2π) dφ ∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ\n\nFirst, integrating with respect to θ:\n∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)](from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2\n\nNext, integrating with respect to φ:\n∫(from 0 to 2π) dφ = [φ](from 0 to 2π) = 2π\n\nMultiplying the results of the two integrals gives the total flux:\nFlux = (2π) * (2) = 4π.\n\nA potential issue is the singularity of the vector field at the origin (r=0), where it is undefined. A direct calculation of the divergence of f gives ∇ ⋅ f = 0 for all r ≠ 0. However, at r=0, the divergence is undefined. This situation is analogous to the electric field of a point charge at the origin, where the divergence is a Dirac delta function. The Divergence Theorem elegantly handles this by relating the volume integral to the surface integral, which is well-defined. The result of the surface integral, 4π, is the correct value for the volume integral of the divergence.\n\nThus, the value of the integral is 4π.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 4 π\nC) 0\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe calculated answer matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
