    "To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy gain per acceleration.**\n    The energy gained by the proton during each acceleration across the electric field is given by the formula:\n    ΔT = q * U₀ * cos(Φs)\n    where:\n    *   `q` is the charge of the proton, which is equal to the elementary charge `e`.\n    *   `U₀` is the peak voltage, given as 190 kV.\n    *   `Φs` is the synchronous phase, given as Φ₀ = π/4.\n\n    So, the energy gain per acceleration is:\n    ΔT = e * (190 * 10³ V) * cos(π/4)\n    ΔT ≈ e * (190,000 V) * 0.7071\n    ΔT ≈ 134,349 eV or 134.35 keV.\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy gain per revolution.**\n    A synchrocyclotron, like a standard cyclotron, accelerates the particle twice per revolution as it crosses the gap between the two \"dee\" electrodes. Therefore, the total energy gained in one full revolution is twice the energy gain per acceleration.\n    ΔT_rev = 2 * ΔT\n    ΔT_rev = 2 * 134.35 keV = 268.7 keV.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of revolutions.**\n    The total number of revolutions (N) is the final kinetic energy (T₁) divided by the energy gained per revolution (ΔT_rev).\n    N = T₁ / ΔT_rev\n    Given:\n    *   T₁ = 950 MeV = 950,000,000 eV\n    *   ΔT_rev = 268,700 eV\n\n    N = 950,000,000 eV / 268,700 eV\n    N ≈ 3535.54\n\nRounding the result to the nearest whole number gives 3536 revolutions.\n\nThe detailed calculation is:\nN = T₁ / (2 * e * U₀ * cos(Φ₀))\nN = (950 * 10⁶ eV) / (2 * e * (190 * 10³ V) * cos(π/4))\nN = (950 * 10⁶) / (2 * 190 * 10³ * (1/√2))\nN = (950 * 10⁶) / (√2 * 190 * 10³)\nN = (950 / 190) * (10³ / √2)\nN = 5 * (1000 / √2)\nN = 5000 / √2\nN ≈ 3535.53\n\nThis value rounds to 3536.\n\n<<<A>>>"
