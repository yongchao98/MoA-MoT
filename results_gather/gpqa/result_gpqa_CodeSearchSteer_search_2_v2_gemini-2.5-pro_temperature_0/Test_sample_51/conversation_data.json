    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels changes, we can use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### 1. The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (N₂) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level (N₁) is given by:\n\n**N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT)**\n\nwhere:\n*   **g₁** and **g₂** are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n*   **ΔE** is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   **k** is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   **T** is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Energy Difference (ΔE)\n\nThe energy difference (ΔE) can be calculated from the wavelength (λ) of the transition using the Planck-Einstein relation. A convenient formula for this calculation when λ is in Angstroms (Å) and ΔE is in electron-volts (eV) is:\n\n**ΔE (eV) ≈ 12400 / λ (Å)**\n\nGiven the wavelength λ ≈ 1448 Å:\n\n**ΔE ≈ 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.56 eV**\n\n### 3. Setting up the Ratio of Ratios\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the population ratio changes. This is the ratio of the population ratio without spots (at T_nospots = 6000 K) to the population ratio with spots (at T_spots = 5500 K).\n\nLet's denote the population ratio (N₂/N₁) as \"Ratio\".\n\n**Factor = Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots**\n\n**Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]**\n\nThe statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\n**Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]**\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n**Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]**\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nNow, we can substitute the known values into the equation:\n\n*   **ΔE** ≈ 8.56 eV\n*   **k** ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K (Boltzmann constant in eV per Kelvin)\n*   **T_nospots** = 6000 K\n*   **T_spots** = 5500 K\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term (ΔE / k):\n\n**ΔE / k ≈ 8.56 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99338.5 K**\n\nNext, let's calculate the temperature-dependent part:\n\n**1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots = 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 ≈ 1.515 x 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹**\n\nFinally, we calculate the factor:\n\n**Factor = exp[ 99338.5 K * (1.515 x 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹) ]**\n**Factor = exp(1.505)**\n**Factor ≈ 4.50**\n\nThe calculation confirms that the ratio of atoms in the higher energy state to the lower energy state is approximately 4.5 times larger when the star is hotter (no spots) compared to when it is cooler (with spots). This is consistent with the observation that the ratio decreases when the star has spots.\n\n<<<D>>>"
