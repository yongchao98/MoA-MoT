    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the Schrödinger cat state for the given parameters.\n\n**1. Define the State and Parameters**\n\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n|ψ⟩ = (cos(φ)|α⟩ + sin(φ)|-α⟩) / N\n\nThe parameters are:\n*   Phase: φ = -π/4\n*   Amplitude: α = 0.5\n*   Normalization constant: N = √(1 + sin(2φ) * exp(-2|α|²))\n\nFor the given parameters:\n*   sin(2φ) = sin(-π/2) = -1\n*   |α|² = 0.5² = 0.25\n*   exp(-2|α|²) = exp(-0.5)\n*   N² = 1 - exp(-0.5)\n\nThe state is a pure state, so its density matrix is ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|.\n\n**2. Understand the Non-Gaussianity Measure**\n\nThe relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity is defined as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the reference Gaussian state (τ) and the von Neumann entropy of the state in question (ρ):\nnG = S(τ) - S(ρ)\nwhere S(ρ) = -Tr(ρ ln ρ).\n\nSince ρ is a pure state, its entropy S(ρ) is 0. Therefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\nnG = S(τ)\n\n**3. Determine the Reference Gaussian State (τ)**\n\nThe reference state τ is a Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as ρ.\n\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):** The average displacement is ⟨a⟩ = Tr(ρa). For the given state with φ = -π/4 (an odd cat state), the displacement is zero. ⟨a⟩ = 0. This means the reference state τ is a centered Gaussian state.\n\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance Matrix):** A centered Gaussian state is defined by its covariance matrix (V), which depends on the average photon number ⟨n⟩ = ⟨a†a⟩ and the squeezing parameter ⟨a²⟩.\n\n    *   Calculation of ⟨a²⟩:\n        ⟨a²⟩ = (α² / N²) * [1 + sin(2φ)exp(-2|α|²)] = (α² / N²) * [1 - exp(-0.5)] = α² = 0.25\n\n    *   Calculation of ⟨n⟩:\n        ⟨n⟩ = (|α|² / N²) * [1 - sin(2φ)exp(-2|α|²)] = (|α|² / (1 - exp(-0.5))) * [1 + exp(-0.5)]\n        Using exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065:\n        ⟨n⟩ ≈ 0.25 * (1 + 0.6065) / (1 - 0.6065) = 0.25 * (1.6065 / 0.3935) ≈ 1.0207\n\n**4. Calculate the Covariance Matrix (V)**\n\nThe elements of the covariance matrix for the quadratures q = (a + a†)/√2 and p = (a - a†)/(i√2) are:\n*   V₁₁ = ⟨q²⟩ = Re(⟨a²⟩) + ⟨n⟩ + 1/2 = 0.25 + 1.0207 + 0.5 = 1.7707\n*   V₂₂ = ⟨p²⟩ = -Re(⟨a²⟩) + ⟨n⟩ + 1/2 = -0.25 + 1.0207 + 0.5 = 1.2707\n*   V₁₂ = Im(⟨a²⟩) = 0 (since ⟨a²⟩ is real)\n\nThe determinant of the covariance matrix is:\ndet(V) = V₁₁ * V₂₂ ≈ 1.7707 * 1.2707 ≈ 2.25\n\n**5. Calculate the Entropy of the Gaussian State S(τ)**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is calculated from the symplectic eigenvalue (ν) of its covariance matrix.\n*   **Symplectic Eigenvalue (ν):** The convention relating the eigenvalue to the determinant is ν = 2 * √det(V).\n    ν = 2 * √2.25 = 2 * 1.5 = 3\n\n*   **Entropy Formula:** The von Neumann entropy is given by:\n    S(τ) = ((ν+1)/2)ln((ν+1)/2) - ((ν-1)/2)ln((ν-1)/2)\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    S(τ) = ((3+1)/2)ln((3+1)/2) - ((3-1)/2)ln((3-1)/2)\n    S(τ) = (4/2)ln(4/2) - (2/2)ln(2/2)\n    S(τ) = 2ln(2) - 1ln(1)\n    Since ln(1) = 0:\n    S(τ) = 2ln(2) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862\n\nThe calculated amount of non-Gaussianity is approximately 1.38.\n\n<<<A>>>"
