    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1 and Deduce the General Structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (a tricyclic C10 compound) is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   ¹H NMR: 14 protons total, consistent with the starting material's proton count (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a ketone (C=O), typically in a non-conjugated six-membered ring.\n*   **Subsequent Reactions:** The product undergoes ozonolysis in a later step, which indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O containing one ketone and one double bond has four degrees of unsaturation. A tricyclic skeleton (like adamantane) already has three degrees of unsaturation from the rings. Adding a ketone and a double bond would require five degrees of unsaturation, corresponding to a formula of C₁₀H₁₂O. Since the ¹H NMR shows 14 protons, the product cannot be tricyclic. It must be **bicyclic**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The harsh reaction conditions (strong base, high temperature) cause the tricyclic adamantane skeleton to undergo a fragmentation and rearrangement to form a bicyclic unsaturated ketone with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O. A plausible core structure is based on bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, a known rearrangement product of adamantanes. The exact structure is difficult to determine from the provided data, and there appears to be an inconsistency in the reported ¹H NMR spectrum, but the general features (bicyclic, C₁₀H₁₄O, ketone, C=C) are clear.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2 to Find Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Reagents:** This indicates a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction.\n*   **Transformation:** The MPV reaction selectively reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. The C=C double bond remains intact.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group in Product 1 is reduced to a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Product 2 is a bicyclic unsaturated alcohol (C₁₀H₁₆O).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 3 and Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide ((CH₃)₂S).\n*   **Transformation:** This is an ozonolysis with a reductive workup. This reaction cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones).\n*   **Deduction:** For this problem, we must consider the structure resulting from the cleavage of the double bond within the bicyclic framework. Let's assume the plausible bicyclo[3.3.1]nonene core for Product 2. The double bond is located in one of the six-membered rings. Let's label the bridgehead carbons C1 and C5. One six-membered ring is C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C9, and the other is C1-C8-C7-C6-C5-C9. Let's assume the double bond is between C6 and C7.\n*   **Ozonolysis Cleavage:** The cleavage of the C6=C7 bond will open the ring, forming a large monocyclic compound with two new carbonyl groups where C6 and C7 were.\n    *   If the double bond is monosubstituted (e.g., on a terminal vinyl group), this is not possible within the ring structure.\n    *   If the double bond is disubstituted (e.g., -CH=CH-), two aldehyde groups are formed.\n    *   If the double bond is trisubstituted (e.g., >C=CH-), a ketone and an aldehyde are formed.\n*   **The Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton will be an aldehyde proton (-CHO), typically appearing at δ 9-10 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Coupling Pattern**\n\n*   The coupling (splitting) pattern of the aldehyde proton is determined by the number of protons on the adjacent carbon atom (the α-carbon).\n*   Let's analyze the structure around the newly formed aldehyde group. Assume the ozonolysis of the C6=C7 bond in the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonene skeleton of Product 2 creates an aldehyde at the position of the original C7 atom.\n*   The carbon atom adjacent to this newly formed aldehyde group is the C8 atom of the original bicyclic system.\n*   In the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework, the C8 position is a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   Therefore, the aldehyde proton is adjacent to a -CH₂- group, which has two protons.\n*   According to the n+1 rule, these two neighboring protons will split the aldehyde proton's signal into a **triplet** (n=2, so 2+1=3 lines).\n\nThis conclusion holds for any isomer of a methyl-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonene where the double bond is in a position like C6=C7, C2=C3, etc., as the adjacent carbon in the ring will be a CH₂ group.\n\n<<<A>>>"
