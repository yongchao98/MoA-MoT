    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the core structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The formula for this part of the molecule is therefore C6H4.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR data:** The spectrum shows absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-). This functional group contains two oxygen atoms, accounting for the \"O2\" part of the chemical formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR data:** This provides the most detailed information about the substituents.\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint, eliminating any structures that contain a methylene group.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a simple doublet. This confirms the presence of a –CH=CH–CH3 substituent. This group contains one of the two required –CH3 signals.\n    *   **Finding the second –CH3 group:** The ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl signal can be explained by a methyl ester functional group (–COOCH3). This structure provides the second –CH3 signal and does not contain any –CH2 groups.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, such as para-substitution, where there are two pairs of chemically equivalent protons.\n\n4.  **Assemble the structure and determine the formula:**\n    *   The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3) and a methyl ester group (–COOCH3).\n    *   Let's sum the atoms to find the molecular formula:\n        *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the C6H4 ring) + 1 (from the –COO– group) + 1 (from the –OCH3 group) + 3 (from the –CH=CH–CH3 group) = 11 carbons.\n        *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the C6H4 ring) + 3 (from the –OCH3 group) + 4 (from the –CH=CH–CH3 group) = 11 hydrogens. Let's re-count the hydrogens on the propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3 has 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 hydrogens. So, the total hydrogen count is 4 (aromatic) + 3 (ester methyl) + 5 (propenyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify against the options:**\n    *   **C11H12O2:** This matches our derived formula.\n    *   **C11H14O2:** This would require saturating the double bond of the propenyl group to a propyl group (–CH2CH2CH3), which would introduce –CH2 signals, contradicting the NMR data.\n    *   **C12H12O2 and C12H14O2:** These formulas would require adding more carbons and hydrogens, which is inconsistent with the clear interpretation of the NMR signals that perfectly account for a C11H12O2 structure without any –CH2 groups.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic information, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
