    "This multi-step synthesis is a complex sequence designed to yield a specific final product. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the reactive diene and Product 1**\n\nThe reaction of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide (NaI) is a known method to generate a highly reactive diene, **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**. This is an isomer of o-quinodimethane and will act as the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction.\n\nThe dienophile is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which has two double bonds. The problem states that 2 equivalents of the diene precursor are used. This strongly implies that a **double Diels-Alder reaction** occurs, with one molecule of the generated diene reacting with each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative. The result, **Product 1**, is a large, symmetrical molecule with a central norbornane scaffold.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard method for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) at the 7-position of the norbornane core is converted into a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming the alcohol, **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is treated with sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (SO₃·py) in DMSO. This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild reaction that oxidizes a secondary alcohol to a ketone. The hydroxyl group at the 7-position is oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O), yielding **Product 3**. Product 3 is a symmetrical ketone built on a 7-ketonorbornane framework, flanked by the two adducts from the Diels-Alder reactions.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\nProduct 3 is heated to 150°C. This thermal treatment induces a **double retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This reaction is the reverse of the initial cycloaddition. The complex structure of Product 3 fragments, releasing the central 7-ketonorbornane piece and two molecules of the diene, 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. The 7-ketonorbornane is unstable under these conditions and may decompose further, but the stable organic product formed is the diene.\n\nThus, **Product 4 is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the symmetry of Product 4.\n\n*   **Structure:** 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene has a six-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4, and exocyclic double bonds at C5 and C6.\n*   **Symmetry:** The cyclohexadiene ring is not planar and typically adopts a twisted, C₂-symmetric conformation. This symmetry has important consequences for the equivalence of the hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Ring Protons:** The C₂ axis of symmetry passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This axis makes the proton on C1 equivalent to the proton on C4. Similarly, the proton on C2 is equivalent to the proton on C3. This gives two distinct signals for the four ring protons.\n*   **Methylene Protons:** The two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂) are also equivalent due to the C₂ symmetry. However, within each methylene group, the two protons are not equivalent. Because the molecule as a whole is chiral (lacking any improper axis of rotation, like a mirror plane), the two protons on each methylene group are diastereotopic. This means they reside in different chemical environments and will have different chemical shifts. Since the two methylene groups are themselves equivalent, this results in two distinct signals for the four methylene protons.\n\nIn total, we have:\n1.  One signal for the H1/H4 protons.\n2.  One signal for the H2/H3 protons.\n3.  One signal for one set of diastereotopic methylene protons.\n4.  One signal for the other set of diastereotopic methylene protons.\n\nTherefore, there are **4** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
