    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles—isolated north or south poles—exist, two of Maxwell's four fundamental equations of electromagnetism would be different.\n\nIn our universe, a key principle is that magnetic poles always come in pairs. This is mathematically expressed by Gauss's law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B) is zero. This equation essentially says that there are no magnetic \"charges\" or monopoles from which magnetic field lines can originate or terminate. If a magnetic monopole were to exist, it would act as a source or sink for the magnetic field, meaning the divergence of B would be proportional to the density of these magnetic charges, fundamentally altering this equation.\n\nFurthermore, the existence of magnetic monopoles would introduce a new level of symmetry to Maxwell's equations. A moving magnetic monopole would constitute a \"magnetic current.\" In the current model, Faraday's Law of Induction describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t). To maintain symmetry, a magnetic current would also need to generate a circulating electric field. This would add a new term to Faraday's Law, changing the equation that describes the circulation of the electric field.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would be modified are:\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**, which relates to the **divergence of the magnetic field**.\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction**, which relates to the **circulation (or curl) of the electric field**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
