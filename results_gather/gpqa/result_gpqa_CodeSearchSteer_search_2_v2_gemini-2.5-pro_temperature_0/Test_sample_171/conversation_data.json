    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is given by:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the excited state (energy E₂) and the ground state (energy E₁), respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n*   E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the two levels (ΔE).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's denote the ratio of the population of the excited state to the ground state for each star as R:\n*   For star 1 (temperature T₁): R₁ = (N₂/N₁)₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]\n*   For star 2 (temperature T₂): R₂ = (N₂/N₁)₂ = (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in star 1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star 2. This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the ground state is twice as large for star 1 compared to star 2.\n\nR₁ = 2 * R₂\n\nNow, we substitute the Boltzmann equations into this relationship:\n\n(g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] = 2 * [(g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g₂/g₁) is the same for both stars and cancels out:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\nTo solve for the relationship between T₁ and T₂, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n\nln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)])\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms (ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(exp(x)) = x), we get:\n\n-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n\nRearranging the terms to solve for ln(2):\n\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)\n\nFactor out the common term ΔE/k:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)\n\nTo combine the fractions in the parenthesis, we find a common denominator (T₁*T₂):\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)]\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE/k is approximately 1.\n\nΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\nSubstituting this value into our derived equation:\n\nln(2) = 1 * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nln(2) = [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)]\n\nThis equation matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
