    "To find the expectation value of the operator `10σ_z + 5σ_x`, we first need to define the quantum state and the operators in matrix form.\n\nThe spin-up `|↑⟩` and spin-down `|↓⟩` states are represented by the vectors:\n`|↑⟩ = [1, 0]`\n`|↓⟩ = [0, 1]`\n\nThe given linear superposition state is `|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`. In matrix form, this is:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * [1, 0] + (√3)/2 * [0, 1] = [0.5, √3/2]`\n\nThe Pauli matrices `σ_z` and `σ_x` are defined as:\n`σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n`σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe operator in question is `O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x`. Let's construct this operator:\n`O = 10 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] + 5 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n`O = [[10, 0], [0, -10]] + [[0, 5], [5, 0]]`\n`O = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]`\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `O` for a state `|ψ⟩` is calculated as `⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`. The term `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ⟩`. Since the components of `|ψ⟩` are real, it is simply the transpose:\n`⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]`\n\nNow, we can calculate the expectation value. It's often simpler to calculate the expectation values for `σ_z` and `σ_x` separately and then combine them.\n\n1.  **Expectation value of `σ_z`:**\n    `⟨σ_z⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩`\n    `σ_z|ψ⟩ = [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [0.5, √3/2] = [0.5, -√3/2]`\n    `⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [0.5, -√3/2]`\n    `= (0.5 * 0.5) + (√3/2 * -√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n2.  **Expectation value of `σ_x`:**\n    `⟨σ_x⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩`\n    `σ_x|ψ⟩ = [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5, √3/2] = [√3/2, 0.5]`\n    `⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]`\n    `= (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\n3.  **Combine the results:**\n    The expectation value of the full operator is:\n    `⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10 * ⟨σ_z⟩ + 5 * ⟨σ_x⟩`\n    `= 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n    `= -5 + 2.5 * √3`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value. Using `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732`\n`≈ -5 + 4.33`\n`≈ -0.67`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the value is -0.7.\n\n<<<D>>>"
