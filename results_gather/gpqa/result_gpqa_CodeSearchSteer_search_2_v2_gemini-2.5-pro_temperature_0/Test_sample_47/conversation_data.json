    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂):** This reaction is an α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone, which is **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH):** When an α-halo ketone, like 2-bromocyclohexanone, is treated with a strong base such as NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, which then undergoes ring contraction. The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring, forming cyclopentanecarboxylic acid as **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2) reacts with thionyl chloride in a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride. Pyridine is used to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction. This yields cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride as **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H):** This reagent is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, and the reaction can be stopped at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3) is reduced to **Product 4**, which is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must examine its structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure consists of a cyclopentane ring bonded to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The single hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is chemically unique. (1 type)\n2.  **C1 Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring directly attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** The cyclopentane ring has a plane of symmetry passing through C1 and the aldehyde group. This makes the hydrogens on C2 equivalent to the hydrogens on C5. However, on each of these carbons, the two hydrogens are diastereotopic (one is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and one is *trans*). Therefore, the two *cis* hydrogens (on C2 and C5) form one set, and the two *trans* hydrogens form another set. (2 types)\n4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** Similarly, the hydrogens on C3 are equivalent to the hydrogens on C4 due to the plane of symmetry. Again, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. This gives two more sets of equivalent hydrogens. (2 types)\n\nCounting the distinct types:\n*   1 aldehyde hydrogen\n*   1 hydrogen on C1\n*   2 types of hydrogens on C2/C5\n*   2 types of hydrogens on C3/C4\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
