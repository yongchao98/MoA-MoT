    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula can be used to calculate the degree of unsaturation, which indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms in the formula, this is very likely an ester, which usually appears between 1750-1715 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons, and its triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group. This pattern is characteristic of the methyl part of an ethyl group (-CH₂**CH₃**).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal for 2 protons is a quartet (q), meaning it is adjacent to a -CH₃ group. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom within an ester (-COO**CH₂**CH₃). This confirms the presence of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons in this region is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-**NH₂**). The broadness is due to proton exchange and quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals, both doublets (d) and each integrating to 2 protons, are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two different chemical shifts for the aromatic protons mean the two substituents on the ring have different electronic effects. The electron-donating amino group (-NH₂) shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield (to ~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBased on the combined analysis:\n*   The molecule contains a **primary amine** (-NH₂).\n*   It contains an **ethyl ester** group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   These two groups are attached to a **benzene ring** in a **1,4 (para) arrangement**.\n\nThis information leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, and has a secondary amine (N-H), which would show only one IR band.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ethyl group is part of the propionate, not the ester's alcohol portion. The NMR would be different.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted (1,3) amide, which contradicts the NMR aromatic pattern and the IR data.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data. The ¹H NMR data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate shows a triplet at ~1.35 ppm, a quartet at ~4.31 ppm, a broad singlet for the amine protons, and two doublets for the aromatic protons at ~6.62 and ~7.84 ppm, which is consistent with the provided data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
