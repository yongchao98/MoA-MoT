    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its host star, for a circular orbit, is given by the ratio of the star's radius (R_star) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a):\n    *   P_transit ≈ R_star / a\n\n2.  **Probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2:**\n    *   For Planet_1: P₁ = R₁ / a₁\n    *   For Planet_2: P₂ = R₂ / a₂\n    where R₁ and R₂ are the radii of the host stars, and a₁ and a₂ are the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n3.  **Ratio of Probabilities:** To determine which planet is more likely to transit and by what factor, we calculate the ratio P₁ / P₂:\n    *   P₁ / P₂ = (R₁ / a₁) / (R₂ / a₂)\n\n4.  **Using the Given Information:**\n    *   We are told that both host stars have the same radii: R₁ = R₂.\n    *   Substituting this into the ratio, the radii cancel out:\n        P₁ / P₂ = a₂ / a₁\n\n5.  **Applying Kepler's Third Law:** To find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁), we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period (P), the semi-major axis (a), and the host star's mass (M_star):\n    *   a³ ∝ M_star * P²\n    *   This can be rewritten as: a ∝ (M_star * P²)^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can express the ratio a₁ / a₂ in terms of the stellar masses and orbital periods:\n    *   a₁ / a₂ = [ (M₁ * P₁²) / (M₂ * P₂²) ]^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Substituting Known Relationships:** We are given:\n    *   The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of the host star of Planet_2: M₁ = 2 * M₂.\n    *   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2: P₁ = P₂ / 3.\n    *   Substitute these into the equation for a₁ / a₂:\n        a₁ / a₂ = [ (2 * M₂ * (P₂ / 3)²) / (M₂ * P₂²) ]^(1/3)\n        a₁ / a₂ = [ (2 * M₂ * P₂² / 9) / (M₂ * P₂²) ]^(1/3)\n        a₁ / a₂ = (2 / 9)^(1/3)\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute the ratio of the semi-major axes back into the ratio of the probabilities:\n    *   P₁ / P₂ = a₂ / a₁ = 1 / (a₁ / a₂)\n    *   P₁ / P₂ = 1 / [ (2 / 9)^(1/3) ]\n    *   P₁ / P₂ = (9 / 2)^(1/3)\n    *   P₁ / P₂ = (4.5)^(1/3)\n    *   P₁ / P₂ ≈ 1.65096\n\nThe result shows that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
