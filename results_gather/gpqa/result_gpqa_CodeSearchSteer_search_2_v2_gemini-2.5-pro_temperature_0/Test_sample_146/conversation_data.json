    "The initial calculation seems correct. The search results confirm the rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938.3 MeV. Using a more precise value won't significantly change the result to match another option, but let's recalculate with 938.27 MeV.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the principles of conservation of energy and momentum, which are fundamental in particle annihilation processes.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify Initial State:**\n    *   One proton ($p$) and one antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. To conserve momentum (initially near zero), the proton must also be nearly at rest. This setup describes annihilation at rest in the center-of-momentum frame.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton.\n    *   $E_p = m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27$ MeV\n    *   $E_{\\bar{p}} = m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27$ MeV\n    *   $E_i = E_p + E_{\\bar{p}} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n2.  **Identify Final State:**\n    *   Two particles $A^+$ and two particles $A^-$.\n    *   All four particles have the same rest mass, given by $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    *   By conservation of energy, the total initial energy is converted into the total final energy of the four A particles.\n    *   To conserve the initial zero momentum, the four final particles must be produced with a total momentum of zero. The most straightforward way for this to happen is if they share the available energy equally. Therefore, each of the four particles will have the same total energy, $E_A$.\n    *   The total final energy is $E_f = 4 \\times E_A$.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_i = E_f$\n    *   $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n    *   $E_A = \\frac{1876.54}{4} \\text{ MeV} = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Velocity:**\n    *   The total energy of a single particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   We know $E_A = 469.135$ MeV and $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    *   $469.135 = \\gamma \\times 300$\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{469.135}{300} \\approx 1.56378$\n\n5.  **Convert Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$) to Velocity (v):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    *   $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.56378)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.44541}}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.40892} = \\sqrt{0.59108}$\n    *   $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n    *   This corresponds to option D.\n\nThe calculation is robust. The key assumptions (annihilation at rest, equal energy distribution) are standard for this type of problem unless specified otherwise. The physics principles (conservation of energy and momentum) and the relativistic formulas are applied correctly.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.91c\nC) 0.96c\nD) 0.77c\n\nMy calculated value of approximately 0.77c matches option D perfectly.\n\nFinal Answer is D.\nThe problem is a straightforward application of relativistic kinematics.\nInitial Energy = $2 \\times m_p c^2$\nFinal Energy = $4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times \\gamma m_A c^2$\nSet them equal and solve for $\\gamma$, then for $v$.\n\n$2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}$\n$1876.54 = 1200 \\gamma$\n$\\gamma = 1.56378$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 1/(1.56378)^2} \\approx 0.7688$\n$v \\approx 0.77c$\n\nThe result is consistent and the calculation is verified.\n\n<<<D>>>"
