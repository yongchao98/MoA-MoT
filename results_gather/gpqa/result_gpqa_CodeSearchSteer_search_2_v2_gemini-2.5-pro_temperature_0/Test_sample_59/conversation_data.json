    "To determine how long the journey to Earth will take for the 22-year-old astronaut, we first need to establish the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and then apply the principles of time dilation from special relativity.\n\n### Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud\n\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way. Its distance from Earth has been measured with increasing accuracy over the years. Recent measurements place it at approximately 163,000 light-years away. One study published in the journal *Nature* in 2013 determined the distance to be 49.97 kiloparsecs (which is about 163,000 light-years) with an accuracy of 2.2%. Other sources also cite similar distances, ranging from 160,000 to 179,000 light-years. For our calculation, we will use the value of 163,000 light-years.\n\n### Time of Travel from Earth's Perspective\n\nThe spacecraft is traveling at a constant speed of 0.99999987 times the speed of light (c). From the perspective of an observer on Earth, the time it would take for the spacecraft to travel 163,000 light-years is calculated as:\n\n*   **Time = Distance / Velocity**\n*   Time = 163,000 light-years / 0.99999987 *c*\n*   Time ≈ 163,000.02 years\n\nSo, from an Earth-based observer's point of view, the journey takes just over 163,000 years.\n\n### Time Experienced by the Astronaut (Time Dilation)\n\nDue to the effects of time dilation, as described by Einstein's theory of special relativity, time will pass much slower for the astronaut traveling at near the speed of light compared to an observer on Earth. The formula for time dilation is:\n\n*   **t' = t * √(1 - v²/c²)**\n\nWhere:\n*   **t'** is the time experienced by the moving observer (the astronaut).\n*   **t** is the time measured by the stationary observer (on Earth), which is approximately 163,000.02 years.\n*   **v** is the velocity of the spacecraft (0.99999987*c*).\n*   **c** is the speed of light.\n\nLet's calculate the Lorentz factor (the part of the equation under the square root):\n\n*   v/c = 0.99999987\n*   v²/c² = (0.99999987)² ≈ 0.99999974\n*   1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026\n*   √(1 - v²/c²) ≈ √0.00000026 ≈ 0.0005099\n\nNow, we can calculate the time experienced by the astronaut:\n\n*   t' ≈ 163,000.02 years * 0.0005099\n*   t' ≈ 83.11 years\n\nSo, for the astronaut, the journey will take approximately 83.11 years.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe astronaut is 22 years old at the start of the journey. The trip will take about 83.11 years from their perspective.\n\n*   Age upon arrival = 22 years + 83.11 years = 105.11 years\n\nSince the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years, the astronaut will be approximately 105 years old upon reaching Earth, well within their lifespan.\n\nComparing our calculated travel time of approximately 83.11 years to the given options:\nA) 77 years\nB) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\nC) 81 years\nD) 72 years\n\nThe calculated time of 83.11 years is closest to 81 years. The minor difference can be attributed to the precise distance value used for the Large Magellanic Cloud, as it can vary slightly depending on the source. For instance, using a slightly shorter distance of around 160,000 light-years would result in a travel time closer to 81.6 years.\n\n<<<C>>>"
