    "Based on the analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and the reaction conditions, the following conclusion is reached:\n\n1.  **Product Identification:** The 1H and 13C NMR spectra are characteristic of an α,β-unsaturated ketone containing a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   The **13C NMR** signal at δ 197.7 ppm indicates a ketone carbonyl group.\n    *   The **1H NMR** signals at δ 7.71 (2H, d) and δ 7.08 (2H, d) are indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring. The two singlets at δ 2.28 (3H) and δ 2.31 (3H) correspond to two different methyl groups that are not adjacent to any protons. The two doublets at δ 6.75 (1H) and δ 7.68 (1H) are characteristic of two protons on a trans-disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-).\n    *   Assembling these fragments leads to the structure **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**. One methyl singlet is the acetyl group (CH3-C=O), and the other is attached to the para position of the phenyl ring (a p-tolyl group). The vinylic protons are adjacent to the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group. The molecular formula of this product is C11H12O, which is consistent with that of the starting material, Compound X. The existence and name of this compound are confirmed in chemical databases.\n\n2.  **Reaction Analysis:** Compound X (C11H12O) is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) at 403 K (130 °C). DABCO is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. These conditions are suitable for a base-catalyzed elimination or rearrangement reaction.\n\n3.  **Identification of Compound X:** We must determine which of the given options would rearrange to form (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    *   The product contains a 4-methylphenyl (p-tolyl) group. Therefore, the starting material must also contain this group, as the reaction conditions do not facilitate methylation of a phenyl ring. This eliminates options B and C, which contain a phenyl group.\n    *   Option A, 2-styrylepoxide, has the wrong molecular formula (C10H10O).\n    *   Option D, **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**, has the correct molecular formula (C11H12O) and contains the necessary p-tolyl group. Its structure is a vinyl epoxide.\n    *   The reaction is a known base-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide. DABCO abstracts an acidic proton from the terminal CH2 group of the oxirane. The resulting anion triggers the opening of the epoxide ring to form a dienolate, which then tautomerizes to the more stable α,β-unsaturated ketone product.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
