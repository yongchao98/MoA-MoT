    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) is treated with mCPBA. The epoxidation reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face. For a trans-alkene, this results in a trans-epoxide. Since the mCPBA can attack from either the top or bottom face of the alkene with equal probability, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides is formed: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The epoxide mixture is then treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis that opens the epoxide ring. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen (an *anti*-addition or backside attack).\n    *   When the (4R,5R)-epoxide is attacked by water at either C4 or C5, it results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Similarly, when the (4S,5S)-epoxide is attacked, the product is also (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has two chiral centers but possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral meso product.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) is treated with mCPBA. The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide. This specific product, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, is a meso compound because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The meso-epoxide is then opened by aqueous acid. The backside attack by water can occur at either C4 or C5 with equal likelihood.\n    *   Attack at C4 (which is R) leads to inversion of stereochemistry at that carbon, producing (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 (which is S) leads to inversion at that carbon, producing (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are enantiomers. Since both are formed in equal amounts, Reaction 2 produces a racemic mixture.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the product of Reaction 1 (the meso-diol) with the products of Reaction 2 (the racemic mixture of (R,R)- and (S,S)-diols). The final mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (meso compound)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns use an achiral stationary phase and separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers (like the meso compound and the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and will be separated.\n    *   Consequently, the chemist will observe **two peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the unresolved racemic mixture.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns use a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the racemic mixture into its two constituent enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, which will elute at different times.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and appear as its own peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chemist will observe **three peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the standard HPLC will show 2 peaks, and the chiral HPLC will show 3 peaks.\n\n<<<C>>>"
