    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first understand the reaction that takes place.\n\n**1. The Reactant and Reagents:**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n**2. The Reaction:**\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent. This mixture is known to completely reduce several oxygen-containing functional groups to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically:\n*   Carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Aldehyde groups (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   This reagent also reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes) to single bonds (alkanes).\n\n**3. Structure and Molecular Formula of the Reactant:**\nLet's break down the name to determine the structure and formula of the starting material:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group, which by convention is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl:** A -CHO group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A -CH=CH2 group at position 5.\n\nFrom this structure, we can deduce the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** After accounting for all the bonds, the formula is C10H12O3.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the reactant is 5, calculated as follows:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 5.\nThis corresponds to one ring, one double bond in the ring, one double bond in the vinyl group, one C=O in the carboxylic acid, and one C=O in the formyl group (1+1+1+1+1 = 5).\n\n**4. Structure and Molecular Formula of the Product:**\nThe reaction with red P and excess HI will cause the following reductions:\n*   The carboxylic acid at C1 becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group at C2 becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is saturated.\n*   The double bond in the vinyl group is saturated, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product is a saturated, substituted cyclohexane ring. The carbon skeleton remains, so the product will have 10 carbon atoms. Since all double bonds are saturated and all oxygen atoms are removed, the resulting molecule is a cycloalkane. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n\n**5. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\nThe IHD is a measure of the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nFor the product (C10H20):\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of the single ring in the cyclohexane structure.\n\n<<<D>>>"
