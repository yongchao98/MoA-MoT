    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between distance and parallax.** The distance to a star (`r`) is inversely proportional to its parallax (`plx`). This fundamental relationship in astronomy can be written as:\n    `r ∝ 1/plx` or `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n\n2.  **Interpret the given information.** The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". In the context of star counts, this typically refers to the cumulative number of stars (N) with a parallax greater than a certain value `plx`. This is equivalent to the total number of stars within a certain distance `r`. So, we can write:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars as a function of distance.** We can substitute the relationship from step 1 into the expression from step 2. Since `plx ∝ 1/r`, we get:\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `N ∝ r^5`\n    This equation tells us that the total (cumulative) number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n4.  **Determine the change in the number of stars per unit distance.** The question asks for how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This is asking for the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative of the cumulative number `N` with respect to `r`, or `dN/dr`.\n\n5.  **Differentiate the expression.** We differentiate the proportionality from step 3 with respect to `r`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ d/dr (r^5)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ 5r^4`\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
