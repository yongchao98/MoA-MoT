    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n### 1. Calculate the initial moles of each substance\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles for each of the reactants.\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 moles of CH3COOH**\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 moles of HCl**\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing **0.080 moles of H+**.\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = **0.090 moles of Ba(OH)2**\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-), the moles of hydroxide ions (OH-) are:\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 moles of OH-**\n\n### 2. Determine the total moles of acid and base\n\nNext, we find the total moles of acidic protons that can react and the total moles of hydroxide ions.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid (H+)** = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH3COOH\n    *   Total H+ = 0.080 mol (from strong acid) + 0.050 mol (from weak acid) = **0.130 moles**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH-)** = **0.180 moles**\n\n### 3. Perform the neutralization reaction\n\nThe strong base (OH-) will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids.\n\n*   Moles of OH- (0.180 mol) are greater than the total moles of H+ (0.130 mol). Therefore, the base is in excess.\n*   **Excess moles of OH-** = Total OH- - Total H+\n    *   Excess OH- = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 moles of OH-**\n\n### 4. Calculate the final concentration and pH\n\nThe final solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH-), which will determine the pH.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Excess moles of OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L = **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
