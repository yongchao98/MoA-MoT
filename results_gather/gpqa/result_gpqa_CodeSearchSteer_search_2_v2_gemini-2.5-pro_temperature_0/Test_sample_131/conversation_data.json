    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### 1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1, the total number of aromatic protons from each compound must be equal. Let's say each compound contributes 'x' protons to the aromatic region. The total integration would be 2x. The two signals having a 1:1 ratio means each signal corresponds to 'x' protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### 2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Option\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Low.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. This will produce **two separate singlets**, each for 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C5, the one at C2, and the two equivalent ones at C1 and C3. This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 3H:3H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1:2**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Moderate.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are adjacent (ortho-coupling). They will split each other, producing **two doublets**, not singlets.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: C1/C4 and C2/C3. This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. This will produce a **quartet** (4H, from the two -CH2- groups) and a **triplet** (6H, from the two -CH3 groups).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options Based on the Mixture's Spectrum\n\nNow, let's analyze the combined spectrum for a 1:1 mixture of each pair.\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets, each of 6H.\n    *   The combined spectrum would show **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data for the alkyl region.\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two doublets (1H each).\n    *   The problem states there are \"two singlets\" in a 1:1 ratio. This appears to be a contradiction. However, the alkyl region data is a perfect and unambiguous match. It is highly likely that the description of the aromatic region is slightly inaccurate in the problem statement. For instance, the two doublets from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene might be considered as one \"signal\" (a multiplet) integrating to 2H. This would result in two signals (one singlet, one multiplet) with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. Given the perfect fit of the alkyl data, this is the most plausible option.\n\n**B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:** This mixture would show three singlets (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) plus a quartet and a triplet (from 1,4-diethylbenzene). This does not match the observation of only three singlets.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The combined spectrum would have four singlets with a ratio of 12:6:3:3 (or 4:2:1:1). This does not match the observed 2:1:1 ratio unless there is an accidental overlap of the two 3H signals, which is an extra assumption.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** This mixture would show three singlets (one 2H and two 1H signals), which contradicts the \"two signals\" observation.\n\n**D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:** This mixture would produce at least five singlets (two from 1,2,3,4-TMB and three from 1,2,3,5-TMB), which is inconsistent with the data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data for the alkyl region (three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio) is uniquely and perfectly explained by the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Despite the conflicting description of the aromatic region signals as \"singlets,\" the strength of the evidence from the alkyl region makes this the only logical choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
