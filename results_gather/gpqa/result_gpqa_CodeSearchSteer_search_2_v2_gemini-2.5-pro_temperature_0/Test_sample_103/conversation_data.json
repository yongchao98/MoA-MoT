    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the gravitational pull they exert on their host star. This pull causes the star to \"wobble,\" moving towards and away from us. This movement induces a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight. The maximum measured wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the velocity amplitude (K).\n    *   Δλ ∝ K\n\n3.  **The Velocity Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0), the velocity amplitude K is given by:\n    *   K = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    Where:\n        *   P is the orbital period of the planet.\n        *   m_p is the mass of the planet.\n        *   M_star is the mass of the star.\n        *   G is the gravitational constant.\n        *   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n\n4.  **Apply the Given Information:** The problem states that for both systems:\n    *   The mass of the stars are the same (M_star1 = M_star2).\n    *   The mass of the planets are the same (m_p1 = m_p2).\n    *   We can assume the orbital inclinations (i) are comparable, as is standard in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\n    Therefore, the term `(m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))` is a constant for both planets. This simplifies the relationship between the velocity amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P) to:\n    *   K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Establish the Ratio:** Since the wavelength shift (Δλ) is proportional to K, we can also say:\n    *   Δλ ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n    We can now write a ratio for the two planets:\n    *   (Δλ₂ / Δλ₁) = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute the Values and Solve:** We are given:\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\n    Substituting these into the ratio:\n    *   (7 / 5) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   (7 / 5)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    *   343 / 125 = P₁ / P₂\n    *   2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n7.  **Find the Final Answer:** The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We take the reciprocal of the previous result:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it is significantly shorter. This aligns with the initial data, as a larger Doppler shift (planet #2) implies a larger stellar velocity, which in turn is caused by a planet in a closer, shorter-period orbit.\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.36 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
