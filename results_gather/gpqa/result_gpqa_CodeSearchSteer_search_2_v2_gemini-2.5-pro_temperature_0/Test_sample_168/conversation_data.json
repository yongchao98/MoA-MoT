    "The problem describes a nuclear decay analogous to double-beta decay. Let's analyze the two processes.\n\n### Process 1: Standard Decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V)\n\nThis process is akin to the standard two-neutrino double-beta decay (2νββ). In this decay, the final state consists of multiple particles (the two B nucleons, the two E particles, and the two V particles). The total energy released in the decay, known as the Q-value, is distributed among the kinetic energies of all these final-state particles.\n\nBecause the energy is shared among several particles, the energy of any single particle (or pair of particles, like the two E particles) is not fixed. Instead, it follows a continuous distribution. The sum of the kinetic energies of the two E particles can range from zero up to a maximum value, which is the Q-value of the decay. This results in a continuous energy spectrum with a specific endpoint.\n\n### Process 2: Variant Decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + M)\n\nThis variant decay involves the emission of a single exotic, massless particle M instead of the two V particles. This scenario is analogous to neutrinoless double-beta decay with the emission of a Majoron, a hypothetical massless particle.\n\n1.  **Nature of the Spectrum:** In this variant decay, the final state still consists of multiple bodies (2B, 2E, and M). Since there are three types of particles in the final state, the released energy is shared among them. Consequently, the total energy of the two E particles is not fixed but is distributed over a range of values. Therefore, the energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous. The shape of the spectrum, however, will be different from the first process because the number of particles in the final state (and thus the phase space) has changed.\n\n2.  **Endpoint of the Spectrum:** The endpoint of the energy spectrum is determined by the total energy released, the Q-value. The Q-value is calculated from the difference in rest mass between the initial and final states.\n    *   **Q-value for Process 1:** Q₁ = (Mass_initial - Mass_final)c² = (2mₐ - 2mₑ - 2mₑ - 2mᵥ)c²\n    *   **Q-value for Process 2:** Q₂ = (Mass_initial - Mass_final)c² = (2mₐ - 2mₑ - 2mₑ - mₘ)c²\n\n    We are given that particle M is massless (mₘ = 0). Particle V, analogous to a neutrino, is described as a \"light particle,\" which implies it has a small but non-zero mass (mᵥ > 0).\n\n    Comparing the two Q-values:\n    *   Q₁ = (2mₐ - 2mₑ - 2mₑ)c² - 2mᵥc²\n    *   Q₂ = (2mₐ - 2mₑ - 2mₑ)c²\n\n    Since mᵥ is positive, the term `2mᵥc²` is positive. This means that Q₂ is greater than Q₁. The energy that was converted into the rest mass of the two V particles in the first decay is now available as kinetic energy in the second decay. As the endpoint of the E particle spectrum corresponds to the Q-value, the endpoint for the variant decay is higher.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe spectrum of the outgoing E particles in the variant decay remains continuous because it is still a multi-body final state. However, the endpoint of this spectrum increases because the total energy released is greater due to the final products having less total rest mass (a massless M versus two massive V particles).\n\n<<<B>>>"
