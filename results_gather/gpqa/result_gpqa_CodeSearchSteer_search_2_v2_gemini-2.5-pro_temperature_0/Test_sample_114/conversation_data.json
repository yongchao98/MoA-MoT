    "To determine the angle between the directions of the two photons produced in the annihilation of an electron and a positron, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Initial State: Energy and Momentum\n\nFirst, we calculate the total energy and momentum of the system before the collision. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. The momentum is given by p = √(E² - (mc²)²)/c or p = γmv.\n\n*   **Electron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_e) = 4\n    *   Energy (E_e) = 4mc²\n    *   Momentum (p_e) = mc√(γ_e² - 1) = mc√(4² - 1) = mc√15. The electron moves from the left, so its momentum is in the positive horizontal direction.\n\n*   **Positron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_p) = 2\n    *   Energy (E_p) = 2mc²\n    *   Momentum (p_p) = mc√(γ_p² - 1) = mc√(2² - 1) = mc√3. The positron moves from the right, so its momentum is in the negative horizontal direction.\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy (E_initial):**\n    *   E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²\n\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (p_initial):**\n    *   The collision occurs along the horizontal axis, so the initial vertical momentum is zero.\n    *   p_initial = p_e - p_p = mc(√15 - √3)\n\n### Final State: Energy and Momentum of Photons\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced.\n\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):**\n    *   The problem states that the two photons have the same energy (E_γ).\n    *   According to the conservation of energy: E_initial = E_final.\n    *   6mc² = 2E_γ\n    *   Therefore, the energy of each photon is E_γ = 3mc².\n\n*   **Final Momentum (p_final):**\n    *   For a photon, the momentum is p = E/c.\n    *   The momentum of each photon is p_γ = (3mc²)/c = 3mc.\n    *   The initial vertical momentum was zero, so the final vertical momentum must also be zero. This is consistent with the observation that one photon moves in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right, implying their vertical momentum components are equal and opposite.\n    *   Let θ be the angle of each photon's path with respect to the horizontal axis. The total horizontal momentum of the two photons is the sum of their individual horizontal components:\n    *   p_final = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ) = 2(3mc)cos(θ) = 6mc cos(θ).\n\n### Calculating the Angle\n\nBy the law of conservation of momentum, the total initial momentum must equal the total final momentum.\n\n*   p_initial = p_final\n*   mc(√15 - √3) = 6mc cos(θ)\n\nWe can cancel out 'mc' from both sides:\n\n*   cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\nNow, we calculate the value of θ:\n\n*   √15 ≈ 3.873\n*   √3 ≈ 1.732\n*   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n*   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\nThe question asks for the total angle between the directions of the two photons, which is 2θ.\n\n*   Total Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis value is very close to 138.\n\n<<<A>>>"
