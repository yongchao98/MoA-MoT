    "The problem asks for the minimum energy of a system of 13 identical particles. One particle is fixed at a point P, and the other 12 are constrained to a distance of 2 meters from P, effectively moving on the surface of a sphere. To achieve the minimum energy state, the 12 mobile particles will arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible to minimize their mutual electrostatic repulsion. This is a classic physics problem known as the Thomson problem.\n\nFor 12 particles, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when they are at the vertices of a regular icosahedron inscribed within the sphere. The total energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies between all pairs of particles. This can be broken down into two components:\n1.  The potential energy between the central particle and the 12 particles on the sphere.\n2.  The potential energy among the 12 particles on the sphere.\n\n**1. Calculation of Physical Constants and Parameters:**\n*   Charge of each particle (q) = 2e\n*   Elementary charge (e) ≈ 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C\n*   Coulomb's constant (k) ≈ 8.98755 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C²\n*   Radius of the sphere (R) = 2 m\n*   Particle charge (q) = 2 * (1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C) = 3.204353268 × 10⁻¹⁹ C\n\n**2. Energy between Central Particle and Outer Particles (U_center_outer):**\nThe potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 outer charges is the same, as they are all at a distance R.\n*   U_center_outer = 12 * (k * q² / R)\n*   U_center_outer = 12 * ( (8.98755 × 10⁹ * (3.204353 × 10⁻¹⁹)²) / 2 )\n*   U_center_outer ≈ 5.537 × 10⁻²⁷ J\n\n**3. Energy among the 12 Outer Particles (U_outer_outer):**\nThe 12 particles form an icosahedron. The potential energy is the sum of the energies of all 66 pairs of vertices. The distances between vertices in an icosahedron with circumradius R are of three types:\n*   **Edge length (s):** There are 30 pairs of vertices separated by this distance. The edge length `s` is given by `s = R * (4 / sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5)))`.\n*   **Long diagonal (d):** There are 30 pairs separated by this distance, where `d = s * φ` (φ is the golden ratio, ≈ 1.618).\n*   **Diameter (D):** There are 6 pairs of opposite vertices, separated by the diameter `D = 2R`.\n\nFirst, we calculate the distances:\n*   s ≈ 2 * (4 / sqrt(10 + 2 * 2.23607)) ≈ 2.1029 m\n*   d ≈ 2.1029 * 1.618 ≈ 3.4026 m\n*   D = 4 m\n\nNow, we sum the potential energies for all pairs:\n*   U_outer_outer = k * q² * (30/s + 30/d + 6/D)\n*   U_outer_outer ≈ (8.98755 × 10⁹ * (3.204353 × 10⁻¹⁹)²) * (30/2.1029 + 30/3.4026 + 6/4)\n*   U_outer_outer ≈ (9.2285 × 10⁻²⁸) * (14.266 + 8.817 + 1.5)\n*   U_outer_outer ≈ (9.2285 × 10⁻²⁸) * (24.583)\n*   U_outer_outer ≈ 2.2688 × 10⁻²⁶ J\n\n**4. Total Minimum Energy (U_total):**\nThe total energy is the sum of the two components.\n*   U_total = U_center_outer + U_outer_outer\n*   U_total ≈ 5.537 × 10⁻²⁷ J + 2.2688 × 10⁻²⁶ J\n*   U_total ≈ 0.5537 × 10⁻²⁶ J + 2.2688 × 10⁻²⁶ J\n*   U_total ≈ 2.8225 × 10⁻²⁶ J\n\nCorrected to three decimal places, the minimum energy is 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ Joules.\n\n<<<D>>>"
