    "A textile dye with extensively conjugated pi-electrons absorbs light at certain wavelengths and emits light at others. The color of a substance is determined by the wavelengths of light it reflects, while the color it absorbs is the complementary color. In the case of emitted light, the observed color corresponds directly to the wavelength of the light produced.\n\nFirst, we must determine the wavelength of the emitted light from its energy. The energy (E) of a photon is related to its wavelength (λ) by the equation E = hc/λ, where 'h' is Planck's constant and 'c' is the speed of light. A convenient formula for converting energy in electron volts (eV) to wavelength in nanometers (nm) is λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV).\n\nGiven the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, we can calculate the wavelength:\n\nλ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530.07 nm\n\nNext, we identify the color corresponding to this wavelength. Based on the visible light spectrum, a wavelength of approximately 530 nm falls within the green range. The visible light spectrum is generally categorized as follows:\n*   Violet: 380–435 nm\n*   Blue: 436–495 nm\n*   Green: 495–566 nm\n*   Yellow: 566–589 nm\n*   Orange: 589–627 nm\n*   Red: 627–780 nm\n\nSince the dye emits green light, the color of the light it absorbs will be the complementary color of green. On a color wheel, the color opposite to green is red. Therefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<B>>>"
