    "The reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with a Grubbs catalyst is an olefin self-metathesis. The starting material is a 50:50 mixture of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. The metathesis reaction will form 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene and ethene. Excluding ethene, we need to determine the number of possible stereoisomers of 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n\nThe reaction can proceed through three different pathways based on the chirality of the reacting alkenes:\n1.  **(R)-alkene + (R)-alkene:** This homo-coupling produces (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This product has two possible geometries at the double bond, (E) and (Z). Both the (E) and (Z) isomers are chiral.\n2.  **(S)-alkene + (S)-alkene:** This homo-coupling produces (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. The resulting (E) and (Z) isomers are the enantiomers of the products from the (R)+(R) reaction. Together, these two pathways produce two pairs of enantiomers, which amounts to four distinct stereoisomeric products.\n3.  **(R)-alkene + (S)-alkene:** This cross-coupling produces (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. We must analyze the stereochemistry of its (E) and (Z) isomers:\n    *   **(E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule possesses a center of inversion, which makes it an achiral meso compound. This counts as one product.\n    *   **(Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry but lacks any improper rotation axis (like a plane of symmetry or center of inversion). Therefore, it is a chiral molecule. The reaction of the (R) and (S) alkenes will produce a racemic mixture of (Z)-(3R, 6S) and its enantiomer, (Z)-(3S, 6R). This counts as two distinct products.\n\nSumming up the possible products:\n*   From (R)+(R) and (S)+(S) couplings: 4 stereoisomers (two racemic pairs, one E and one Z).\n*   From (R)+(S) coupling: 1 meso compound (the E-isomer) and 2 stereoisomers (the racemic Z-isomers).\n\nThis gives a total of 4 + 1 + 2 = 7 possible stereoisomeric products. However, 7 is not an available option. This suggests an alternative interpretation of the question.\n\nA common interpretation in such problems is to count the number of separable fractions by non-chiral chromatography. In this case, enantiomers are not separated and are counted as a single fraction (a racemate).\n\nLet's count the fractions:\n1.  **Racemic (E)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** The (E)-(3R, 6R) and (E)-(3S, 6S) enantiomers form one racemic fraction.\n2.  **Racemic (Z)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** The (Z)-(3R, 6R) and (Z)-(3S, 6S) enantiomers form a second racemic fraction.\n3.  **Meso (E)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** The (E)-(3R, 6S) isomer is a meso compound and is a diastereomer to all other products, forming a third fraction.\n4.  **Racemic (Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** The chiral (Z)-(3R, 6S) isomer and its enantiomer form a fourth racemic fraction.\n\nUnder this interpretation, there are 4 possible products (fractions).\n\n<<<C>>>"
