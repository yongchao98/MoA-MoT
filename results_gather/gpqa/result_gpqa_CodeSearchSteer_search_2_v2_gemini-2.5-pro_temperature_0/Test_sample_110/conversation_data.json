    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone at the alpha-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor).\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two alpha-carbons (C2 and C6). The C2 carbon is quaternary and has no hydrogens. The C6 carbon is tertiary and has one acidic alpha-hydrogen. Therefore, the t-BuOK base can only remove the proton from the C6 position, forming a single regioselective enolate.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The enolate formed at C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-COOEt`). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product Structure**: After the addition and subsequent protonation (during workup), a `-CH2-CH2-COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position of the original cyclohexanone. The product is 2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n5.  **Product Naming**: To name this product according to IUPAC rules, the ester is considered the principal functional group, making the \"ethyl propanoate\" the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on this chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is attached at the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Numbering the cyclohexyl substituent ring starts with C1 at the point of attachment. The ketone group should have the lowest possible number, which makes it C2.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are a methyl group at C1 (the original C6-methyl) and an ethyl and a methyl group at C3 (the original C2-substituents).\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition reaction. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the 1-nitropropane at the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon), which is acidic. The resulting nitronate anion is a nucleophile (a Michael donor). This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (a Michael acceptor).\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: KOH removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane (`CH3CH2CH2NO2`) to form the resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, `[CH3CH2CH-NO2]⁻`.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon (C3) of but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n4.  **Product Structure**: The resulting structure after protonation by water is `CH3-CH(CH(NO2)CH2CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n5.  **Product Naming**: To name this product, the nitrile group (-CN) is the principal functional group, and the carbon of the nitrile is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the chain: `CN(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`.\n    *   The substituents on this chain are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The product of Reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of Reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, option A correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
