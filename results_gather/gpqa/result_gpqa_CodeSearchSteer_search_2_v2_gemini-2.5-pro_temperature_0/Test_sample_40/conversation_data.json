    "The problem asks for the speed of light in a moving glass medium as measured by an observer in a stationary laboratory frame. This is a classic application of the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Define the frames of reference.**\n    *   Let S be the stationary laboratory frame (the observer's frame).\n    *   Let S' be the moving frame, which is the rest frame of the glass.\n\n2.  **Identify the velocities.**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light within the glass is constant for an observer in the glass's rest frame (S'). This speed, let's call it `u'`, is determined by the index of refraction, `n`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the speed of light in the rest frame of the glass (u').**\n    *   The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`).\n    *   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum `c` should be taken as 1.\n    *   Therefore, `n = c / u' = 1 / u'`.\n    *   Solving for `u'`, we get `u' = 1/n`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Einstein velocity addition formula.**\n    *   The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n        `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n    *   Here, `u` is the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S).\n    *   Substituting `c = 1`, the formula simplifies to:\n        `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the value of u' and simplify.**\n    *   Substitute `u' = 1/n` into the velocity addition formula:\n        `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)v )`\n    *   To simplify this complex fraction, multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n        `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n        `u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result corresponds to the Fizeau experiment, which measured the speed of light in moving water and whose results are explained by special relativity. The speed of light in a medium is not invariant and depends on the relative motion of the observer and the medium. The relativistic velocity addition formula is necessary to correctly combine these velocities.\n\nComparing our derived formula with the given options:\n\nA) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nB) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\nC) 1\nD) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\nThe calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1+nv)/(n+v)`, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
