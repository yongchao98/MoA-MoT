    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames and given information:**\n    *   The \"stationary\" reference frame is the Galaxy (let's call it S).\n    *   The \"moving\" reference frame is the supernova ejecta (let's call it S').\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time that passes in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is the proper time, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n\n2.  **Determine the objective:**\n    *   The goal is to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (`d`).\n\n3.  **Apply the concept of Time Dilation:**\n    *   According to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure a longer time interval for an event than an observer in a moving frame where the event is occurring. This is known as time dilation.\n    *   The time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (`Δt₀`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n    *   The formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`, where `c` is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n    *   So, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's frame would measure about 51.03 seconds.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance of approximately 3,061,800 km is closest to option A. A non-relativistic calculation would yield `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option B). Because of time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance traveled must be greater than 3,000,000 km. This eliminates options B, C, and D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>"
