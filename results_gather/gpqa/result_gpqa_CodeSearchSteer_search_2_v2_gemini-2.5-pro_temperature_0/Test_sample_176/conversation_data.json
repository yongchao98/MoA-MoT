    "The problem requires calculating the ratio of luminosities for two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on their physical properties. The solution involves applying the Stefan-Boltzmann law and accounting for the Doppler effect on the observed wavelengths.\n\n### Key Principles:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is related to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law states that the peak emission wavelength (λ_max) of a black body is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature (T). This relationship pertains to the wavelength emitted by the star in its own rest frame.\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: The wavelength of light observed from a moving source is shifted. For a source moving with a radial velocity (v_r) relative to an observer, the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) by the non-relativistic formula λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c), where c is the speed of light. A positive velocity indicates the source is receding.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio**: From the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio**: The temperature ratio is determined using Wien's Law, which connects temperature to the *emitted* peak wavelength. The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂). We must use the Doppler effect to relate these observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so there is no Doppler shift. The observed wavelength is equal to the emitted wavelength: λ_emitted₁ = λ_obs₁.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. The observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted: λ_obs₂ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we can write: λ_emitted₁ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s) = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 7/3000).\n\n4.  **Connecting to Temperature**: According to Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). The ratio of the temperatures is therefore:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted₂ / λ_emitted₁ = λ_emitted₂ / [λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 7/3000)] = 1 / (1 + 7/3000) = 3000/3007.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Now, substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * (3000/3007)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * (0.99767)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * 0.99073\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis result is approximately 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation and serves as a distractor.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>"
