    "To determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory described by the Lagrangian `\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}`, we need to perform a dimensional analysis and apply the power-counting renormalizability criterion.\n\n### 1. Mass Dimension of κ\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action `S = ∫d⁴x \\mathcal{L}` is dimensionless. Since the spacetime integral `∫d⁴x` has a mass dimension of [M⁻⁴], the Lagrangian density `\\mathcal{L}` must have a mass dimension of [M⁴] to compensate.\n\nNext, we determine the mass dimensions of the fields in the interaction term `\\mathcal{L}_{int}`:\n\n*   **Fermion field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion field is `\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi`. For this term to have a mass dimension of [M⁴], and knowing that the derivative `\\partial_\\mu` has a dimension of [M¹], the combination `\\bar{\\psi}\\psi` must have a dimension of [M³]. This implies that the fermion field `ψ` (and `\\bar{\\psi}`) has a mass dimension of [M³/²].\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor (F<sup>μν</sup>):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `-¼ F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}`. For this to have a mass dimension of [M⁴], `F^{\\mu\\nu}` must have a mass dimension of [M²].\n*   **Sigma tensor (σ<sub>μν</sub>):** The term `\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]` is composed of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless constants. Therefore, `\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}` has a mass dimension of [M⁰].\n\nNow, we can find the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ by ensuring the entire interaction Lagrangian `\\mathcal{L}_{int}` has a mass dimension of [M⁴]:\n\n`[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] [\\bar{\\psi}] [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] [\\psi] [F^{\\mu\\nu}]`\n`[M⁴] = [\\kappa] [M³/²] [M⁰] [M³/²] [M²]`\n`[M⁴] = [\\kappa] [M³] [M²]`\n`[M⁴] = [\\kappa] [M⁵]`\n\nSolving for the mass dimension of κ, `[\\kappa]`:\n\n`[\\kappa] = M⁴ / M⁵ = M⁻¹`\n\nTherefore, the mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n### 2. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nA key criterion for determining if a theory is perturbatively renormalizable is to examine the mass dimensions of its coupling constants.\n\n*   If all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions (≥ 0), the theory is generally renormalizable (or super-renormalizable if the dimension is > 0).\n*   If any coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nSince the mass dimension of κ is -1, which is negative, the theory is non-renormalizable. Non-renormalizable theories often lose predictive power at high energies because an infinite number of counterterms would be needed to cancel divergences that appear in higher-order calculations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
