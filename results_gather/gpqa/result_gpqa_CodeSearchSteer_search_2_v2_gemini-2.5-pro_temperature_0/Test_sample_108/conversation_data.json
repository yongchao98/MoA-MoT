    "To determine which of the given partial waves is not permitted, we must check each option against the fundamental conservation laws of physics: conservation of angular momentum and conservation of parity, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle as it applies to the final two-nucleon (NN) state.\n\n### Summary of a Permitted Transition's Conditions:\n1.  **Initial State (¹S₀):**\n    *   Total Spin `S(NN_initial) = 0`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L(NN_initial) = 0`\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J(NN_initial) = 0`\n    *   Parity `P(NN_initial) = (-1)^L = (-1)⁰ = +1`\n\n2.  **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic Parity `P(X) = -1`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L(X)` is denoted by s (0), p (1), d (2), f (3).\n\n3.  **Final State (NN_final + X):**\n    *   The final two-nucleon state has isospin `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n\n4.  **Conservation and Exclusion Rules:**\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The prompt specifies that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since `T(NN_final) = 0`, this simplifies to `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`, which means that the sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be an **odd** number.\n    *   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state (`J_initial = 0`) must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The final angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J(NN_final)`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`L(X)`). For the sum to be zero, it is required that `J(NN_final) = L(X)`.\n    *   **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state (`P_initial = +1`) must equal the total parity of the final state. The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity (`P(NN_final) = (-1)^L(NN_final)`), the intrinsic parity of particle X (`P(X) = -1`), and the parity from the orbital motion of X (`(-1)^L(X)`). This gives the equation: `+1 = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`. This simplifies to requiring that the sum `L(NN_final) + L(X)` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### Analysis of the Options:\n\n| Option | Final NN State | S(NN) | L(NN) | J(NN) | Particle X | L(X) | Pauli Check (S+L odd?) | Parity Check (L(NN)+L(X) odd?) | Ang. Mom. Check (J(NN)=L(X)?) | Permitted? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| A) | `³D₃` | 1 | 2 | 3 | f | 3 | 1+2=3 (**Yes**) | 2+3=5 (**Yes**) | 3=3 (**Yes**) | Yes |\n| B) | `³P₀` | 1 | 1 | 0 | s | 0 | 1+1=2 (**No**) | 1+0=1 (**Yes**) | 0=0 (**Yes**) | **No** |\n| C) | `⁷D₁` | 3 | 2 | 1 | p | 1 | 3+2=5 (**Yes**) | 2+1=3 (**Yes**) | 1=1 (**Yes**) | Yes |\n| D) | `³S₁` | 1 | 0 | 1 | p | 1 | 1+0=1 (**Yes**) | 0+1=1 (**Yes**) | 1=1 (**Yes**) | Yes |\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe transition **B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s** is not permitted. While it satisfies the conservation of angular momentum and parity, it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final two-nucleon state. For the `³P₀` state, `S=1` and `L=1`, so the sum `S+L = 2`, which is an even number. However, the Pauli principle for a `T=0` final state requires this sum to be odd.\n\n<<<B>>>"
