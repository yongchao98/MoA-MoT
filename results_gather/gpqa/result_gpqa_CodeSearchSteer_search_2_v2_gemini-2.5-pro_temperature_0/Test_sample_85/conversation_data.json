    "To determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH4) and borane (BH3), and how they react with the functional groups present in the proposed starting materials. The starting material options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which contains both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), which forms from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy acid.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. It does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu --(LiBH4)--> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH + iBuOH`\n    2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The chiral center is at the C3 position of the starting acid, which becomes the C4 position in the lactone product. Since the bonds to this chiral center are not broken or formed during the reduction or lactonization, its stereochemical configuration is retained. Therefore, to obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Borane (BH3) is a strong reducing agent that is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, even in the presence of esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu --(BH3)--> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`\n    2.  The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, leading to the formation of the lactone and the release of isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the stereochemistry at the C3 chiral center is retained throughout the process. To produce the (S)-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
