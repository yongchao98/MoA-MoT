    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor relates the energy and mass of a relativistic particle. It is the ratio of the total energy (E) to the rest mass energy (m₀c²). In particle physics units where c=1, this simplifies to the ratio of energy to mass.\n    *   E = 27 GeV\n    *   m₀ = 3.41 GeV/c²\n    *   γ = E / m₀ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n2.  **Calculate the particle's lifetime in the laboratory frame (τ):** Due to time dilation, a moving particle's lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab frame than its proper lifetime (τ₀).\n    *   Proper lifetime τ₀ = 8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s\n    *   Lab frame lifetime τ = γ * τ₀ = 7.918 * (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s) ≈ 6.334 x 10⁻¹⁵ s\n\n3.  **Calculate the mean decay length (L):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. For a highly relativistic particle, its velocity (v) is very close to the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s).\n    *   L = v * τ ≈ c * τ\n    *   L = (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (6.334 x 10⁻¹⁵ s) ≈ 1.90 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n4.  **Determine the required resolution (d):** The decay of particles follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle will travel a distance 'x' or more before decaying is given by P(x) = e^(-x/L). To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, 'd'. The problem requires observing at least 30% of the decays.\n    *   P(x > d) ≥ 0.30\n    *   e^(-d/L) ≥ 0.30\n\n    To find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition, which represents the largest distance (i.e., the worst or \"minimum\" resolution) that still satisfies the requirement.\n    *   e^(-d/L) = 0.30\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -d/L = ln(0.30)\n    *   d = -L * ln(0.30)\n    *   d ≈ -(1.90 x 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)\n    *   d ≈ 2.288 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n5.  **Compare with the options:** The calculated value for the resolution is approximately 2.29 x 10⁻⁶ m. This value is closest to option D. The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding in the problem's given values. With a resolution of 2.08*1e-6 m, one would be able to observe `exp(-2.08e-6 / 1.90e-6) ≈ 33.5%` of the decays, which satisfies the \"at least 30%\" condition.\n\n<<<D>>>"
