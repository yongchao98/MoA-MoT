    "The initial derivation is confirmed by my understanding of geometry and the definition of parallax. The search results confirm the fundamental relationship that parallax is inversely proportional to distance (`d = 1/p`). They also confirm that the assumption of uniform star distribution is a standard approach for such theoretical problems. The derivation steps are sound.\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Density (ρ):** The number of stars per unit volume is constant.\n2.  **Volume of a Spherical Shell:** The number of stars at a distance `d` in a shell of thickness `dd` is `dN = ρ * (Volume of shell) = ρ * 4πd² dd`.\n3.  **Parallax-Distance Relation:** Parallax `p` is defined as `p = 1/d`, so `d = 1/p`.\n4.  **Relating Differentials:** Differentiating `d` with respect to `p` gives `dd/dp = -1/p²`. So, the thickness of the shell in terms of parallax is `dd = |(-1/p²) dp| = (1/p²) dp`.\n5.  **Substitution:** Substitute `d` and `dd` into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/p)² * (1/p²) dp`\n    `dN = (4πρ / p⁴) dp`\n6.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/dp`) changes with parallax (`p`).\n    `dN/dp = 4πρ / p⁴`\n7.  **Proportionality:** Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/p⁴`.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\nFinal check of the logic.\n- The volume of space increases with the square of the distance (`d²`).\n- The number of stars in a shell at distance `d` is proportional to `d²`.\n- Distance `d` is proportional to `1/plx`. So the number of stars at a given parallax is proportional to `(1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n- However, the question asks for the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*.\n- A given range of parallax `Δplx` corresponds to a range of distances `Δd`.\n- As `d = 1/plx`, `Δd ≈ Δplx / plx²`.\n- So the volume of the shell is `4πd²Δd ≈ 4π(1/plx)² * (Δplx / plx²) = 4π * Δplx / plx⁴`.\n- The number of stars `ΔN` in this volume is `ρ * 4π * Δplx / plx⁴`.\n- The number of stars per unit range of parallax is `ΔN/Δplx = 4πρ / plx⁴`.\n- The logic holds. The answer is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.Here is a step-by-step derivation of the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax and the parallax itself, under the assumption of a uniform distribution of stars.\n\n1.  **Uniform Stellar Distribution**: The fundamental assumption is that stars are distributed uniformly throughout space. This means the number density of stars, denoted by ρ (rho), is constant everywhere.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume**: The number of stars (dN) within a small volume of space (dV) is given by `dN = ρ * dV`.\n\n3.  **Volume of a Spherical Shell**: To find the number of stars at a certain distance, we can consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n\n4.  **Substituting Volume**: By substituting the expression for dV into the equation from step 2, we get the number of stars in this thin shell: `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n\n5.  **Parallax and Distance**: Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to the star. This relationship is expressed as `d = 1/plx`.\n\n6.  **Expressing Distance in Terms of Parallax**: We can substitute this relationship into the equation for dN: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd`.\n\n7.  **Relating the Range of Distance to the Range of Parallax**: We also need to express the thickness of the shell, `dd`, in terms of a range of parallax, `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating the distance equation with respect to parallax:\n    `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n    For a small range, we can consider the magnitude, so `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n8.  **Final Substitution**: Now, substitute this expression for `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n9.  **Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax**: The question asks for how the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`, changes with parallax. From the equation above, we can see:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is directly proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
