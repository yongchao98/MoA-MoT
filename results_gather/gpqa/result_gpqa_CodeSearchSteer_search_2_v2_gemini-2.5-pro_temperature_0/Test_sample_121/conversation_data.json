    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Synthesis**\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is an alpha-bromination reaction, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Acetic anhydride and pyridine facilitate the formation of an enol or enolate, which then reacts with bromine. The product is bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Bromoacetic acid is heated with ethanol and sulfuric acid. This is a classic Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester. The product is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate is treated with sodium cyanide. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction. The product is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   NaH, a strong base, removes an acidic proton from the carbon between the cyano and carbonyl groups.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in a nucleophilic substitution.\n    *   Because excess NaH is used, the remaining acidic proton on the same carbon is removed, forming another carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other bromine-bearing carbon at the end of the pentane chain. This cyclization forms a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   The final product (4) is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **¹H NMR Analysis of the Final Product**\n\nThe structure of the final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CN\n          |\n       /--C--\\\n      |       |\n     CH₂     CH₂\n     |       |\n     CH₂     CH₂\n      \\--CH₂--/\n          |\n         C=O\n          |\n          O\n          |\n         CH₂\n          |\n         CH₃\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry and Chemical Equivalence:**\n    1.  The central carbon of the cyclohexane ring (C1) is bonded to four different groups: a cyano group (-CN), an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOEt), and two different paths around the ring. This makes C1 a chiral center.\n    2.  Due to the presence of this chiral center, the molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    3.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation and will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are adjacent to the chiral center (C1). This makes them diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent and will produce **2 distinct signals**.\n    4.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This process averages the signals of the axial and equatorial protons on each carbon.\n        *   However, because the molecule as a whole is asymmetric, the five methylene (CH₂) groups of the ring are all in chemically different environments. The CH₂ group at C2 is not equivalent to the one at C6, and the one at C3 is not equivalent to C5. The CH₂ group at C4 is also unique.\n        *   Therefore, there are **5 distinct signals** for the protons on the cyclohexane ring.\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for -CH₃) + 2 (for -OCH₂-) = 3 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 5 signals\n    *   Total = 3 + 5 = **8 signals**\n\nThus, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
