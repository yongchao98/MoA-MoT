    "Here is a breakdown of the observations and an analysis of the potential explanations:\n\n### Analysis of the Observations\n\n*   **1H NMR Data:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is correct (1H). This indicates the presence of two very similar, but not identical, chemical species in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the difference must arise from the molecules' overall structure.\n*   **LC-MS Data:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude material into two distinct peaks of equal intensity, confirming the presence of two different species in equal amounts. The mass spectrometry (MS) shows that both peaks have the identical mass, which matches the expected mass of the target peptide. This is a crucial piece of information, as it proves the two species are isomers (molecules with the same formula but different structures). The separation at elevated temperature suggests the two species are stable and do not easily interconvert, otherwise the peaks might broaden or merge.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is unlikely. A precursor from the synthesis would almost certainly have a different molecular weight, which contradicts the MS data showing both peaks have the same mass as the final product.\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** This is the most plausible explanation.\n    *   **Formation:** Diastereomers could form during peptide synthesis if one of the chiral amino acid building blocks was not enantiomerically pure (a mix of L- and D-forms was used) or if epimerization (inversion of a stereocenter) occurred at one of the alpha-carbons during a coupling step.\n    *   **Properties:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereomers give different NMR spectra. It is common for corresponding protons, like the alpha-proton, to have slightly different chemical shifts, which explains the two observed peaks.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Due to their different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. Since they are isomers, they have the exact same mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n*   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** \"Double coupling\" is a procedural step in solid-phase synthesis to ensure a reaction goes to completion; it does not describe a type of isomeric product. Side-products from coupling agents would have a different mass. This option is not a chemically sound explanation for the observed data.\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** This is incorrect.\n    *   **Properties:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images that have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   **NMR:** In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and produce identical NMR spectra. One would only see a single set of peaks, not two. To see separate peaks, a chiral solvent or shift reagent would be required.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Enantiomers cannot be separated by a standard (achiral) LC column; they would elute as a single peak. A special chiral column is needed to resolve them.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe observation of two species with the same mass but different NMR signals and different retention times on an LC column is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture. This likely arose from an issue with the stereochemical purity of one of the starting amino acids or epimerization during synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>"
