    "An N-sided polygon with an infinitely large N and a constant apothem 'a' approximates a circle with radius 'a'. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nWhen monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk, called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric bright and dark rings. The angular positions of the intensity minima (dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function.\n\nThe general formula for the angular position (θ) of the minima in the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by:\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = m * (λ / D)\n\nwhere:\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the aperture.\n*   m is a coefficient corresponding to the order of the minimum.\n\nIn this problem, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle, so the diameter D = 2a.\n\nThe angular positions for the first two minima are given by specific values for the coefficient m:\n*   For the first minimum: θ₁ = 1.22 * (λ / D) = 1.22 * (λ / 2a) = 0.610 * (λ / a).\n*   For the second minimum: θ₂ = 2.23 * (λ / D) = 2.23 * (λ / 2a) = 1.115 * (λ / a).\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is the difference between their angular positions:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ = (1.115 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.115 - 0.610) * (λ / a)\nΔθ = 0.505 * (λ / a)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 0.610 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value of 0.505 λ / a is closest to 0.506 λ / a. The minor difference is due to the precision of the coefficients used for the minima positions. Using more precise values for the zeros of the Bessel function would yield a result even closer to 0.506 λ / a.\n\nTherefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<B>>>"
