    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct ¹H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C₆).\n    *   It is di-substituted, meaning two groups are attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   The total carbon count is 8. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute 2 carbons.\n    *   FTIR data confirms a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen attached directly to the ring).\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I). This substituent has 0 carbons.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the carbonyl group and both of the remaining 2 carbons. The only common chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. Its structure is a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data Options:**\n    *   The general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃. This molecule has protons on the aromatic ring (4H) and protons on the methyl group (3H).\n    *   Protons on an aromatic ring typically appear in the chemical shift range of 6.5-8.5 ppm.\n    *   The protons of a methyl group next to a carbonyl (an acetyl group) typically appear as a singlet around 2.0-2.6 ppm.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. This would correspond to a halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), which is an isomer. However, the description of the methylene (-CH₂) and aldehyde (-CHO) protons as singlets is generally inaccurate, as they would couple to each other.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts are mostly outside the typical aromatic proton region. This data does not match an aromatic compound.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows two signals in the aromatic region, `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indicator of a 1,4- (or para-) disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   It also shows a singlet at `2.3 (3H, s)`. A singlet integrating to three protons in this chemical shift region is perfectly characteristic of an acetyl methyl group (-COCH₃).\n        *   This data is an excellent match for a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm) and cannot be correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe data in option C accurately describes the ¹H NMR spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone, which fits all the conditions given in the problem description.\n\n<<<C>>>"
