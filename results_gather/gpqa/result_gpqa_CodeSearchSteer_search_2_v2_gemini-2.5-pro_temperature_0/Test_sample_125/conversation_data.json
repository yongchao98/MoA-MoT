    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the original molecule has a stereocenter at C5, the reduction can form two different stereoisomers depending on the direction of the hydride attack. These two products, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers of each other. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the two ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. This results in three possible stereoisomers.\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Products**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **Chromatogram Analysis**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated from them. The enantiomers themselves will not be separated and will elute as one peak. This results in **two peaks** from Reaction II.\n\nSince the products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (diols), it is highly unlikely they will have the same retention times. Therefore, the total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from each reaction.\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   Each of the five stereoisomers produced in the reactions is chemically unique and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   Therefore, all five compounds will be resolved into separate peaks.\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
