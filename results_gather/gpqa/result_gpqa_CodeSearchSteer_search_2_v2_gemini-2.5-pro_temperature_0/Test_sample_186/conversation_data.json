    "To determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must assess two key factors for each star: its visibility from the Paranal Observatory and whether its apparent brightness meets the detection threshold.\n\nA star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 can be achieved in a one-hour exposure. According to the European Southern Observatory (ESO), for ESPRESSO coupled with a single 8m VLT telescope (1-UT mode), this S/N level is achieved for stars with an apparent visual magnitude (V) of about 17.\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. This southern latitude restricts the visibility of stars in the far northern sky. A star's declination (DEC) must be greater than approximately -65 degrees to be observable, and practically, stars with very high positive declinations are difficult or impossible to observe.\n\nHere is the analysis for each star:\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):** Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of approximately -0.74.\n*   **Visibility:** Its declination is about -52° 41', placing it in the southern celestial hemisphere, making it easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** As its brightness is far greater than the V=17 limit, Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):** Polaris has an apparent magnitude that hovers around 1.98.\n*   **Visibility:** Its declination is approximately +89° 15'. From Paranal's latitude of -24.6°, Polaris is permanently below the horizon and therefore **not observable**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since it cannot be observed from the VLT's location, Polaris is **not detectable**.\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude (M) of 15, at 10 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** A declination of 0° makes it perfectly observable from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):** We calculate the apparent magnitude using the formula `m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5`, where M=15 and d=10 pc.\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 * 1 - 5 = 15`\n*   **Conclusion:** With an apparent magnitude of 15, this star is brighter than the V=17 limit and is therefore **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude (M) of 15, at 200 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** A declination of 0° makes it observable.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):** Using the same formula with M=15 and d=200 pc:\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 2.301 - 5 ≈ 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5`\n*   **Conclusion:** An apparent magnitude of ~21.5 is much fainter than the V=17 limit, making this star **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude (M) of 15, at 5 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** A declination of 0° makes it observable.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):** Using the formula with M=15 and d=5 pc:\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 - 5 ≈ 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5`\n*   **Conclusion:** With an apparent magnitude of ~13.5, this star is brighter than the V=17 limit and is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude (M) of 15, at 50 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** A declination of 0° makes it observable.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):** Using the formula with M=15 and d=50 pc:\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.699 - 5 ≈ 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5`\n*   **Conclusion:** An apparent magnitude of ~18.5 is fainter than the V=17 limit, making this star **not detectable**.\n\nIn summary, the detectable stars are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  The star at 10 pc (m=15)\n3.  The star at 5 pc (m=13.5)\n\nA total of 3 stars from the list are detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
