    "This problem involves calculating the probability of radioactive decay, a process that is fundamentally \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability.\n\nFirst, we determine the decay constant (λ), which represents the probability of decay per unit time. The relationship between decay probability (P), the decay constant (λ), and time (t) is given by the formula:\n\n*P(decay) = 1 - e⁻ˡᵗ*\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay is 32% (or 0.32) within 100 minutes. We can use this information to find the decay constant λ.\n\n1.  **Calculate the decay constant (λ):**\n    *   We know that the probability of survival after 100 minutes is `1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   The survival probability is given by `e⁻ˡᵗ`.\n    *   So, `e⁻ˡ*¹⁰⁰ = 0.68`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:**\n    *   Because the process is memoryless, the question is equivalent to finding the probability that a new atom will decay within 150 minutes.\n    *   The probability of decay in 150 minutes is `P = 1 - e⁻ˡ*¹⁵⁰`.\n    *   We can rewrite this as `P = 1 - (e⁻ˡ*¹⁰⁰)¹·⁵`.\n    *   Substituting the value we found in the first step: `P = 1 - (0.68)¹·⁵`.\n\n3.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   `P = 1 - 0.68¹·⁵`\n    *   `P ≈ 1 - 0.5607`\n    *   `P ≈ 0.4393`\n\nConverting this probability to a percentage gives approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
