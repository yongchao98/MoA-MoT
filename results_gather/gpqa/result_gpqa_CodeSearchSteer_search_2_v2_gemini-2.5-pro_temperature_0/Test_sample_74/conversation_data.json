  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To determine the reason for the failed protein overexpression, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed.\n\nThe sequence begins with `5'-ATG...`, which is the correct start codon for translation. The construct is designed to have an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The amino acid sequence for an HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. The corresponding DNA sequence is 5'-TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT-3'.\n\nLet's examine the provided sequence codon by codon:\n*   `ATG`: Start codon (Methionine)\n*   `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`: This sequence correctly codes for the HA tag amino acids (YPYDVPDYA). The final codon `GCC` is a valid codon for Alanine.\n*   `AAA`: This codes for the amino acid Lysine.\n*   `TGA`: This is a stop codon.\n\nThe analysis reveals a premature stop codon (`TGA`) located immediately after the sequence for the HA tag and a single additional amino acid. In protein synthesis, stop codons signal the ribosome to halt translation. Because of this early stop signal, the ribosome would detach from the mRNA after synthesizing only a very short peptide, preventing the translation of the full GADD45G protein sequence that should have followed.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   A) The HA tag sequence itself is correct, so there is no missense mutation within the tag.\n*   B) The presence of a premature stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, which directly explains the failure to express the full-length protein.\n*   C) The issue is the presence of a `TGA` stop codon, not the cellular machinery for handling a `UAA` codon. Stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs, to terminate translation.\n*   D) While a linker might be beneficial, its absence is not the primary issue. The fundamental problem is that the genetic code explicitly instructs translation to stop before the target protein is made.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation is the early termination of translation by the ribosome.\n\n<<<B>>>"
