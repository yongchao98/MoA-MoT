    "To determine which stars can be observed by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must consider two main factors: the star's visibility from each observatory's location and its apparent brightness.\n\n### 1. Observational Constraints\n\n*   **Observatory Locations:**\n    *   The Paranal Observatory is in the Southern Hemisphere in Chile, at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees.\n    *   The W. M. Keck Observatory is in the Northern Hemisphere in Hawaii, at a latitude of about +19.8 degrees.\n    *   A star is visible from both locations if its declination (DEC) falls within the overlapping range of the two observatories. Paranal can observe stars with declinations up to approximately +65 degrees, while Keck can observe stars with declinations down to about -70 degrees. Therefore, the shared observable declination range is roughly between -70 and +65 degrees. The prompt asks to disregard pointing limits, which simplifies this to ensuring the star is geometrically visible from both hemispheres.\n\n*   **Instrument Magnitude Limits:**\n    *   ESPRESSO at Paranal can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (V) brighter than 17 (V < 17).\n    *   HIRES at Keck can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16 (V < 16).\n    *   For a star to be detectable by **both** instruments, it must satisfy the stricter limit, meaning its apparent V magnitude must be less than 16.\n\n### 2. Star-by-Star Analysis\n\nThe analysis combines the declination check for visibility and a calculation of the apparent V magnitude for the brightness check. The formula to calculate apparent magnitude (m) from absolute magnitude (M), distance (d) in parsecs, and absorption in the V band (A_V) is: **m = M - 5 + 5*log10(d) + A_V**.\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Declination:** -75 degrees. This is too far south to be visible from Keck Observatory.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   **Declination:** +55 degrees. This is visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude:** Given as V = 16.5 mag. This is fainter than the V < 16 limit for HIRES.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   **Declination:** +48 degrees. This is visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude:** Given as V = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the V < 16 limit.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   **Declination:** -48 degrees. This is visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:**\n        *   Absolute Magnitude (Mv) = 15.5 mag\n        *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n        *   Absorption (A_V) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n        *   V = 15.5 - 5 + 5*log10(10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n        *   This is fainter than the V < 16 limit for HIRES.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   **Declination:** +60 degrees. This is visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:**\n        *   Absolute Magnitude (Mv) = 16.5 mag\n        *   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n        *   Absorption (A_V) = 0 (not mentioned)\n        *   V = 16.5 - 5 + 5*log10(5) â‰ˆ 11.5 + 5*(0.699) = 11.5 + 3.495 = 14.995 mag.\n        *   This is brighter than the V < 16 limit.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\nBased on this analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<C>>>"
