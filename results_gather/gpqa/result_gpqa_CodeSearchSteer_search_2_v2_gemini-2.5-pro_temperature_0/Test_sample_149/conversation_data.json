    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Starting Compound\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial reactant with the molecular formula C8H9NO from the given 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula C8H9NO has a degree of unsaturation of 5. This is calculated as (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (16 + 2 + 1 - 9)/2 = 10/2 = 5. A value of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (C=C or C=O).\n*   **1H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons in this region suggests a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet for two protons is consistent with a methylene group (-CH2-) that is coupled to a single proton, which would be the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:** Based on the fragments identified (a para-disubstituted ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group), the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization):** These reagents are used to convert a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is transformed into a diazonium group (-N2+Cl-). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   Product after step 1: 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n2.  **H2O (Hydrolysis):** Adding water to the diazonium salt and typically warming the mixture results in the replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Nitrogen gas is evolved during this process.\n    *   Product after step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation):** This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH2- group), which are the requirements for an aldol condensation.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. This dehydration is highly favorable as it results in a conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is more stable. The final product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This compound is a known entity, and its synthesis and properties have been described in the literature.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nThe reaction sequence transforms 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. Because the reaction is heated, the final product is the dehydrated, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, not the intermediate aldol addition product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
