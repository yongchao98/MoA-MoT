    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct answer:\n\n### 1. Understand the Light Variation from Starspots\n\nThe brightness variation of the star is caused by its rotation, which brings a heavily spotted hemisphere and a clean (unspotted) hemisphere into view.\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere, with an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴).\n*   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere has a baseline temperature of 6000K, but 20% of its area (the filling factor, `f`) is covered by cooler spots. The spots have a temperature (Tspot) of 6000K - 1000K = 5000K.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Amplitude of the Star's Light Curve\n\nThe amplitude of the light curve is the relative change in flux between the maximum and minimum brightness.\n\nThe flux from the spotted hemisphere is a combination of the flux from the normal photosphere and the cooler spots.\n*   Flux from the unspotted hemisphere: F_max ∝ T_eff⁴\n*   Flux from the spotted hemisphere: F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n\nThe relative amplitude (A) of the signal is:\nA = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nBy substituting the expressions for flux, the formula simplifies to:\nA = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   Filling factor (f) = 0.20\n*   Effective temperature (T_eff) = 6000 K\n*   Spot temperature (T_spot) = 5000 K\n\nA = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\nA = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\nA = 0.20 * [1 - (625 / 1296)]\nA = 0.20 * [671 / 1296]\nA ≈ 0.20 * 0.5177\nA ≈ 0.10355\n\nSo, the star's brightness varies by approximately 10.4%.\n\n### 3. Relate Starspot Amplitude to Exoplanet Transit Depth\n\nThe problem asks for the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same amplitude signal. For an exoplanet transit, this signal is called the transit depth (Δ). The transit depth is the fraction of the star's light that the planet blocks, which is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\nThe formula for transit depth is:\nΔ = (R_pl / R_star)²\nwhere R_pl is the planet's radius and R_star is the star's radius.\n\nTo find the answer, we set the starspot amplitude equal to the transit depth:\n(R_pl / R_star)² = A\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n\n### 4. Solve for the Relative Radius of the Exoplanet\n\nFinally, to find the relative radius (R_pl / R_star), we take the square root of the amplitude:\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.07\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
