    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   The more massive fragment is `m1`, and the less massive is `m2`.\n    *   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) of the fragments comes from the conversion of mass into energy.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial Mass Energy) - (Final Mass Energy)`\n`Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nFrom the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n`p1 = p2 = p`\n\nThe kinetic energies are:\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nThe kinetic energy is `T = E - m*c^2`.\nFrom this, we can derive the relationship between kinetic energy and momentum:\n`(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2 + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`\n\nFrom momentum conservation, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe know:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n*   `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV` => `T2 = 3 - T1`\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n\nCancel `T1^2` from both sides:\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nThis is the correct relativistic kinetic energy for the more massive fragment.\n\n### 6. Calculate the Difference\n\nThe difference is between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nConvert the result to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
