    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the clues provided:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is close to 277 K. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This strongly suggests that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G:** Precipitate G, when heated, releases substance B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a deuterated hydroxide. Given the subsequent reactions, **G is aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**. Heating Al(OD)₃ causes it to decompose into aluminum oxide and heavy water (2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O).\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) and a gas W. The clue that \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common reducing agents. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful and widely used reducing agent. Its close analog containing a heavier isotope of hydrogen would be **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits the description of substance X.\n\n4.  **Identify Gas W and Confirm the Reaction:** If X is LiAlD₄, it would react with a deuterated solvent to produce the precipitate Al(OD)₃. Let's assume liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O). The reaction would be:\n    LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n\n    Now, let's check if gas W (D₂) fits the description \"its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   A deuterium (D) atom contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A D₂ molecule, therefore, contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    This matches the description perfectly. Thus, the identified substances and the reaction are consistent with all the clues.\n\n5.  **Verify the Keto Acid Reaction:** The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. A keto acid contains both a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. The reduction of both of these functional groups would result in a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains two oxygen atoms. This confirms the identity of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n    *   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1). In LiAlD₄, it is present as 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13). In LiAlD₄, it is present as 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the stable isotope of aluminum is 27.\n    *   **Intermediate Element:** Lithium (Atomic Number 3). The most common isotope has a mass number of 7.\n\n    The question asks for the sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n\n    *   **Total mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium):** There are 4 deuterium atoms. Mass = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 aluminum atom. Mass = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n    **Cumulative Atomic Mass** = (Total mass of Deuterium) + (Total mass of Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
