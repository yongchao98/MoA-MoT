    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the enthalpy of neutralization.\n\n### 1. Calculate the moles of H⁺ ions from the acids:\n*   **From HCl (a strong acid):**\n    *   Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume (L) = 0.2 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since HCl is monoprotic (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻), the moles of H⁺ from HCl are 0.10 mol.\n*   **From H₂SO₄ (a strong acid):**\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = Molarity × Volume (L) = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic (H₂SO₄ → 2H⁺ + SO₄²⁻), the moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ are 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol.\n*   **Total moles of H⁺:**\n    *   Total moles of H⁺ = 0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = 0.28 mol\n\n### 2. Calculate the moles of OH⁻ ions from the base:\n*   **From Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base):**\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = Molarity × Volume (L) = 0.5 mol/L × 0.200 L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)₂ is diacidic (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), the moles of OH⁻ are 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n### 3. Determine the limiting reactant for neutralization:\nThe neutralization reaction is H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O.\n*   We have 0.28 moles of H⁺ and 0.20 moles of OH⁻.\n*   Since the moles of OH⁻ are less than the moles of H⁺, OH⁻ is the limiting reactant.\n*   The number of moles of water formed is equal to the moles of the limiting reactant, which is 0.20 mol.\n\n### 4. Calculate the heat evolved from neutralization (ΔH_neut):\nThe standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -13.7 kcal/mol.\n*   ΔH_neut = Moles of H₂O formed × Enthalpy of neutralization\n*   ΔH_neut = 0.20 mol × (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal\n\n### 5. Account for the heat of precipitation (ΔH_precip):\nA precipitation reaction occurs between the barium ions (Ba²⁺) from Ba(OH)₂ and the sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻) from H₂SO₄.\n*   **Reaction:** Ba²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s)\n*   **Moles of Ba²⁺:** From Ba(OH)₂, moles of Ba²⁺ = 0.10 mol.\n*   **Moles of SO₄²⁻:** From H₂SO₄, moles of SO₄²⁻ = 0.09 mol.\n*   The sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻) is the limiting reactant for this precipitation.\n*   Therefore, 0.09 moles of BaSO₄ will precipitate.\n*   The enthalpy of precipitation for BaSO₄ is approximately -4.66 kcal/mol.\n*   **Calculate ΔH_precip:**\n    *   ΔH_precip = Moles of BaSO₄ formed × Enthalpy of precipitation\n    *   ΔH_precip = 0.09 mol × (-4.66 kcal/mol) = -0.4194 kcal\n\n### 6. Calculate the total enthalpy change (ΔH_total):\nThe total heat evolved is the sum of the heat from neutralization and the heat from precipitation.\n*   ΔH_total = ΔH_neut + ΔH_precip\n*   ΔH_total = -2.74 kcal + (-0.4194 kcal)\n*   ΔH_total = -3.1594 kcal\n\nThis calculated value is not among the options. Let's re-evaluate the standard enthalpy of neutralization. Sometimes a value of -13.6 kcal/mol is used.\n\n**Recalculation using -13.6 kcal/mol:**\n*   ΔH_neut = 0.20 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal\n*   ΔH_total = -2.72 kcal + (-0.4194 kcal) = -3.1394 kcal\n\nThis is still not matching any of the options perfectly. Let's re-examine the problem. It's possible the question only considers the heat of neutralization and ignores the heat of precipitation, as this can sometimes be an intended simplification in textbook problems.\n\nIf we only consider the heat of neutralization:\n*   Using -13.7 kcal/mol, the result is -2.74 kcal.\n*   Using -13.6 kcal/mol, the result is -2.72 kcal.\n\nThe value -2.72 kcal exactly matches option A. It is highly probable that the question expects the calculation to be based only on the heat of neutralization, using the value of -13.6 or -13.62 kcal/mol, and to ignore the additional heat from the precipitation of BaSO₄.\n\n**Final Calculation based on this assumption:**\n1.  **Total moles of H⁺** = 0.28 mol\n2.  **Total moles of OH⁻** = 0.20 mol\n3.  **Limiting reactant** is OH⁻, so 0.20 moles of H₂O are formed.\n4.  **Enthalpy of Neutralization** = Moles of H₂O × Standard Enthalpy\n    *   Enthalpy = 0.20 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
