    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature**\n\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. The formula is:\n\n    T_eq ∝ ( (1 - A) / a² )^(1/4)\n\n    Where:\n    *   `A` is the albedo (the fraction of light reflected by the planet).\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n    Since the problem states that both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - A) term is constant for both and can be disregarded when taking a ratio. The formula simplifies to:\n\n    T_eq ∝ (1 / a²)^(1/4) = 1 / a^(1/2)\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion**\n\n    Kepler's Third Law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, the law states:\n\n    P² ∝ a³\n\n    This can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the orbital period:\n\n    a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n3.  **Combining the Formulas**\n\n    Now, we can substitute the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into our temperature ratio equation:\n\n    a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n\n    By simplifying the exponents, we get:\n\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculation**\n\n    The problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for Planet_1 through Planet_5 as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we can find the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n\n    *   P_2 corresponds to the value 2.\n    *   P_4 corresponds to the value 3.5.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio P_2 / P_4 is 2 / 3.5.\n\n    Now, we plug this value into our final equation:\n\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n\n    Calculating the value:\n\n    (4 / 7) ≈ 0.5714\n    (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.82998\n\n    This value is approximately **0.83**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n\n    Comparing our result to the given options:\n    A) ~0.75\n    B) ~0.83\n    C) ~0.57\n    D) ~0.69\n\n    The calculated ratio of ~0.83 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
