    "Based on the analysis of the provided options and the search results, here is the breakdown:\n\n*   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is a quantum field theory that was the first to encounter the problem of infinities, or ultraviolet (UV) divergences, in calculations. To produce finite, observable quantities, it requires a procedure called renormalization, which uses regularization as a key step to handle the divergent integrals. Therefore, QED requires regularization.\n\n*   **B) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for superstring theory is that it is believed to be free from the ultraviolet (UV) divergences that plague quantum field theories. Instead of point-like particles, the fundamental objects are one-dimensional strings, and this extension smooths out interactions at very short distances (high energies), thus avoiding the infinities. While it may have infrared divergences, it does not have the high-energy UV divergences that necessitate regularization.\n\n*   **C) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory has its own divergence problem related to the self-energy of a point-like charge. If one calculates the energy of the electric field of a point electron, the result is infinite as the radius of the charge approaches zero. This is a high-energy/short-distance problem that requires a form of regularization or renormalization to resolve.\n\n*   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** As the quantum field theory of the strong force, QCD, like QED, suffers from ultraviolet divergences. Methods like lattice regularization are used to define the theory and make calculations possible, which are then related back to the continuum theory. Therefore, QCD requires regularization.\n\nThe only theory listed that is formulated specifically to avoid high-energy ultraviolet divergences and thus does not require regularization for them is Superstring Theory.\n\n<<<B>>>"
