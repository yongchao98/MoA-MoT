    "The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula:\n\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n\nwhere $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number, and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers representing the quantum numbers along the Cartesian axes.\n\nThe energy levels are as follows:\n*   **Ground state (n=0):** $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n*   **First excited state (n=1):** $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n*   **Second excited state (n=2):** $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n*   **Third excited state (n=3):** $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of the quantum numbers ($n_x, n_y, n_z$) that sum to $n$. The formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the n-th energy level is:\n\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, we have $n=3$. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula gives:\n\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, and it has a degeneracy of 10, meaning there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy.\n\n<<<B>>>"
