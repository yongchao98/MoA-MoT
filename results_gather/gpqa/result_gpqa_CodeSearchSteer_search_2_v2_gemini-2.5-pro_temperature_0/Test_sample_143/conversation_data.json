    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the mean decay distance:\n\n1.  **Calculate the lifetime (τ) of the particle.**\n    The lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the decay width Γ, related by the reduced Planck constant ħ (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s).\n    τ = ħ / Γ\n    τ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass (m).\n    γ = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV = 20/3 ≈ 6.67.\n\n3.  **Calculate the particle's velocity (v) as a fraction of the speed of light (β = v/c).**\n    β is related to the Lorentz factor by the formula:\n    β = √(1 - 1/γ²) = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400) ≈ 0.9887.\n\n4.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (d).**\n    The mean decay distance in the laboratory frame is the distance the particle travels at its velocity (v = βc) during its dilated lifetime (γτ).\n    d = γ * β * c * τ\n\n    A more direct way to calculate this is using the product ħc (ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm). The formula for the decay distance becomes:\n    d = γ * β * (ħc / Γ)\n\n    First, calculate the product γ * β:\n    γ * β = (20/3) * √(391/400) = (20/3) * (√391 / 20) = √391 / 3 ≈ 6.591\n\n    Now, substitute the values into the decay distance formula:\n    d = (√391 / 3) * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\n    d ≈ 6.591 * 0.6166 fm\n    d ≈ 4.0655 fm\n\n    Since 1 femtometer (fm) is equal to 10⁻¹⁵ meters (m), the mean decay distance is:\n    d ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
