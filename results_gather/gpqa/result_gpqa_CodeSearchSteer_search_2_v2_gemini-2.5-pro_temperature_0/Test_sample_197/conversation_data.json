    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we first need to calculate the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\nThe relevant equilibria for the formation of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are:\nCo²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺;       β₁ = 9\nCo²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂];     β₂ = 40\nCo²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻;   β₃ = 63\nCo²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻;   β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all the complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the free thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nBy substituting these into the equation for the total cobalt concentration, we get:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions from above, the [Co²⁺] term cancels out:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of each term in the expression for α₂:\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNext, we calculate the sum in the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term for the dithiocyanato complex:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo find the percentage, we multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
