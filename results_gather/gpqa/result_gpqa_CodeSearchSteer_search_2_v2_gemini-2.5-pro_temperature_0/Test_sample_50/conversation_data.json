    "To solve this problem, we use the method of images. The electric field outside the grounded conducting sphere is equivalent to the field produced by the original charge *q* and an \"image\" charge *q'* placed at a specific point inside the sphere. This configuration ensures that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero, as required for a grounded conductor.\n\n1.  **Determine the image charge and its position:**\n    *   The image charge, *q'*, is located along the line connecting the center of the sphere and the charge *q*.\n    *   Its magnitude is given by `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n    *   Its distance from the center, *b*, is `b = R² / d`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from infinity to its final position at distance *d*. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere. This force is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge *q'*.\n\n    A common pitfall is to simply calculate the potential energy between *q* and *q'* as if they were two static charges. The correct potential energy of the system is half the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge. This factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charge (represented by the image charge) is not fixed but is created by the presence of the real charge *q*.\n\n    The potential energy *U* is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`, where `V_image` is the potential at the location of charge *q* created by the image charge *q'*.\n\n3.  **Calculate the potential from the image charge:**\n    *   The distance between the real charge *q* (at *d*) and the image charge *q'* (at *b*) is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - (R² / d) = (d² - R²) / d`.\n    *   The potential `V_image` at the location of *q* is:\n        `V_image = k * q' / (d - b) = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d² - R²) / d]`\n        `V_image = -k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the total potential energy:**\n    *   Now, substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d² - R²)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nThis result can also be obtained by integrating the force on the charge *q* as it is brought from infinity to the distance *d*. The force on charge *q* at a distance *x* from the center is `F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)²`, where `q' = -qR/x` and `b = R²/x`. Integrating this force gives the same potential energy.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)\nB) U = - k * q² * d / (d² - R²)\nC) U = - (1/2) * k * q² * d / (d² + R²)\nD) U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R² / (d² - R²)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
