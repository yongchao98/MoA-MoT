    "To determine the correct IUPAC name, we must first deduce the structure of the molecule from the description and then apply the official naming rules.\n\n### Step 1: Building the Molecular Structure\n\n1.  **Parent Structure**: The molecule is a derivative of benzoic acid, meaning a benzene ring has a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. By convention, this group is assigned to position C1 of the ring.\n2.  **Substituent Positions relative to -COOH (C1)**:\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is *para*, so it is at C4.\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) group are *ortho*, so they are at C2 and C6.\n    *   A carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl) group and a cyano (-CN) group are *meta*, so they are at C3 and C5.\n3.  **Constraint for Final Placement**: A crucial piece of information is that the methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are both *ortho* to the cyano group.\n    *   Let's test the position of the cyano group. It must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   If the cyano group is at C3, the positions *ortho* to it are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is already at C4, which fits. This means the hydroxyl group must be at C2.\n    *   This placement dictates the remaining positions: the dimethylamino group must be at C6 (the other *ortho* position to the acid), and the formyl group must be at C5 (the other *meta* position).\n\nThis gives us a single, unique structure:\n*   **C1**: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n*   **C2**: -OH (Hydroxy)\n*   **C3**: -CN (Cyano)\n*   **C4**: -OCH₃ (Methoxy)\n*   **C5**: -CHO (Formyl)\n*   **C6**: -N(CH₃)₂ (Dimethylamino)\n\n### Step 2: Applying IUPAC Naming Rules\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent**: The parent is benzoic acid.\n2.  **List Substituents**: The substituents are cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, and methoxy.\n3.  **Numbering the Ring**: The -COOH group defines C1. We need to number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants (positions). In this case, the locants are {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} regardless of whether we number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n4.  **Tie-Breaking Rule**: When the set of locants is the same in both directions, IUPAC rules state that we number in the direction that gives the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n5.  **Alphabetize Substituents**:\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n6.  **Determine Numbering Direction**:\n    *   **Clockwise (C1 → C2 → C3...)**: This places the substituents as: 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino. The first alphabetical substituent, \"cyano,\" is at position 3.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise (C1 → C6 → C5...)**: This would place the substituents as: 6-hydroxy, 5-cyano, 4-methoxy, 3-formyl, 2-dimethylamino. The first alphabetical substituent, \"cyano,\" would be at position 5.\n7.  **Select the Correct Direction**: Since 3 is lower than 5, the clockwise numbering is correct.\n8.  **Assemble the Final Name**: List the substituents alphabetically, each preceded by its locant number.\n\nThe correct name is therefore: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
