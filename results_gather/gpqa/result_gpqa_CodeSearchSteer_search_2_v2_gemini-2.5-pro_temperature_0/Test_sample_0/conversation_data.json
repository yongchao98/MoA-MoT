    "To clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, the difference in their energies (ΔE) must be greater than the natural energy width (Γ or ΔE_level) of each level. This energy width is a consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt or τ), there is a minimum uncertainty or spread in its energy (ΔE_level). The relationship is given by:\n\nΔE_level * τ ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere:\n*   **ΔE_level** is the energy width of the state.\n*   **τ** is the lifetime of the state.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nA shorter lifetime leads to a larger uncertainty in energy (a broader energy level). To resolve two levels, the separation between them must be larger than their combined widths, and certainly larger than the width of the broader level.\n\nLet's calculate the energy width for each state:\n\n1.  **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width Γ₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   Γ₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width Γ₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   Γ₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe energy level for state 1 is significantly broader (Γ₁ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) than state 2 because its lifetime is shorter. For the two levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference must be significantly greater than this larger width.\n\nNow, let's compare this requirement with the given options:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than the energy width of either state. The levels would overlap completely.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than the energy width of state 1 (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV). The levels would not be resolved.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is also much smaller than the energy width of state 1. The levels would not be resolved.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This energy difference is about 150 times larger than the energy width of the broader state (10⁻⁴ eV >> 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV). This separation is sufficient to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.\n\nTherefore, the only energy difference that allows for the clear resolution of the two levels is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<D>>>"
