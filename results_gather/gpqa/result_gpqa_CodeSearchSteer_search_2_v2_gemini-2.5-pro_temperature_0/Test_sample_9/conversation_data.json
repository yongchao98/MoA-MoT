    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to analyze the properties of each option based on the principles of planetary science.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is essentially a planet with the same characteristics as Earth. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is about the same as Earth's.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will experience stronger gravitational compression. This self-gravity crushes the material in the planet's interior, packing it more tightly and thus increasing its overall density. Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass planet with an Earth-like composition will be significantly denser than Earth.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with less mass will have weaker gravity and therefore less compression. Its density will be lower than that of an Earth-mass planet with the same composition.\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) is much more massive than Earth, so its gravitational compression will make it significantly denser than 5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (d) is less massive than Earth, so it will be less dense than 5.51 g/cm³.\n\nBy comparing the options, the planet described in (c) will have the highest density due to the intense gravitational compression from its large mass.\n\n<<<A>>>"
