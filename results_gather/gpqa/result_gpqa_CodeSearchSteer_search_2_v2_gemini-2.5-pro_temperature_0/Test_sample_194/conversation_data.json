    "To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet, we must first establish the conditions required for it to exhibit both transit and occultation events. A transit occurs when a planet passes in front of its star, while an occultation is when it passes behind. For a planet in a circular orbit, if a transit occurs, an occultation will also occur. The key is to find the maximum orbital distance (semi-major axis) at which a transit is still possible.\n\n### Key Principles:\n1.  **Transit Condition:** A transit occurs if the projected distance of the planet's center from the star's center is less than the sum of their radii. However, a common simplification in exoplanet problems, which is implied by the problem's options, is to consider the condition that the planet's center must pass in front of the star's disk. This means the impact parameter, `b`, must be less than or equal to 1. The impact parameter is the projected distance at the closest approach, measured in stellar radii.\n2.  **Impact Parameter (`b`):** It is defined as `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`, where `a` is the semi-major axis, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `R_s` is the stellar radius.\n3.  **Shared Inclination:** Since both planets are in the same orbital plane, they share the same inclination, `i`.\n4.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`), or `P² ∝ a³`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Relate the orbits of the two planets:**\n    For the first planet, we are given:\n    *   `b₁ = (a₁ * cos(i)) / R_s = 0.2`\n\n    For the second planet, the maximum orbital period occurs at the maximum possible semi-major axis (`a₂`) that still allows for a transit. Using the simplified condition for a transit, the maximum impact parameter is `b₂ = 1`.\n    *   `b₂ = (a₂_max * cos(i)) / R_s = 1`\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio of the semi-major axes:**\n    We can create a ratio of the two impact parameter equations to eliminate the unknown `cos(i)` and `R_s` terms:\n    `(a₂_max * cos(i)) / R_s` / `(a₁ * cos(i)) / R_s` = `1 / 0.2`\n    `a₂_max / a₁ = 5`\n\n    This shows that the maximum semi-major axis for the second planet is 5 times that of the first planet.\n\n3.  **Calculate the maximum orbital period using Kepler's Third Law:**\n    From Kepler's Third Law, we can write the relationship between the periods and semi-major axes of the two planets:\n    `(P₂_max / P₁)² = (a₂_max / a₁ )³`\n\n    We know `P₁ = 3` days and `a₂_max / a₁ = 5`. Plugging these values in:\n    `(P₂_max / 3)² = 5³`\n    `(P₂_max / 3)² = 125`\n    `P₂_max / 3 = √125`\n    `P₂_max = 3 * √125`\n    `P₂_max = 3 * 5√5 ≈ 3 * 11.18`\n    `P₂_max ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet to exhibit both transit and occultation events is approximately 33.5 days. This calculation relies on the standard definition of the impact parameter and the simplified transit condition that the planet's center must pass across the stellar disk (`b ≤ 1`).\n\n<<<B>>>"
