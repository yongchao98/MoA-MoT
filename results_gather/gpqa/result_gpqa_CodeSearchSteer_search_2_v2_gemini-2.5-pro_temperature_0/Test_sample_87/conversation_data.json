    "The experiment described points to a process of affinity maturation of B cells within the germinal centers of Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut. The key observation is the \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of a \"proliferating cell population\" after antigen exposure.\n\nThis specific type of genetic diversification is known as somatic hypermutation. Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate and adaptive immune response involving a cascade of proteins to eliminate pathogens. It does not involve the mutation of B cell genes.\n*   **B) VDJ recombination:** This process creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors by combining V (variable), D (diversity), and J (joining) gene segments. However, this occurs in the bone marrow during the development of naive B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The experiment describes a process happening in a secondary lymphoid organ after antigen stimulation.\n*   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers, often concurrently with somatic hypermutation. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, which determines the antibody's isotype (e.g., IgM to IgA), not the *variable* region. The variable region dictates antigen specificity, and the question explicitly states that high variability was observed in the variable heavy chain gene.\n\n**Somatic hypermutation (SHM)** is the correct answer because it is a process that introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes in B cells that have been activated by an antigen. This occurs within specialized microenvironments called germinal centers, which are continuously active in Peyer's patches due to constant exposure to antigens from the gut. The purpose of SHM is to generate B cells with slightly different receptors, allowing for the selection of those with the highest affinity for the antigen, a process called affinity maturation. The proliferating cells with high genetic variability in the variable region are the hallmark of this process.\n\n<<<C>>>"
