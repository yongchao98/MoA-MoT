    "To find the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. This principle states that the total probability of finding the particle in all possible locations must be equal to 1.\n\nThe probability of finding the particle at a specific position `x` is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|². Since the problem states that the particles are only ever found between x=1 and x=3, we must integrate the probability density function from 1 to 3, and this integral must equal 1.\n\n**1. Determine the Probability Density Function**\n\nFirst, we calculate |ψ(x)|², which is the product of the wave function ψ(x) and its complex conjugate ψ*(x).\n\nGiven wave function:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe complex conjugate is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\nNow, we multiply them:\n|ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x) * ψ(x)\n|ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]\n|ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² - (0.5*i)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * i²)\n\nSince i² = -1:\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**2. Set up and Solve the Normalization Integral**\n\nThe normalization condition is:\n∫¹³ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\nSubstitute the expression for |ψ(x)|²:\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe can split this into two separate integrals:\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫¹³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\nNow, we solve the integrals:\nThe integral of a²/(1+x) is a² * ln|1+x|.\nThe integral of 0.25 is 0.25x.\n\nSo, we have:\n[a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x] evaluated from 1 to 3 = 1\n\n**3. Evaluate the Definite Integral**\n\nSubstitute the limits of integration (3 and 1):\n= (a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3) - (a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1)\n= (a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25)\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\n**4. Solve for \"a\"**\n\nSet the result of the integral equal to 1:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value of ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
