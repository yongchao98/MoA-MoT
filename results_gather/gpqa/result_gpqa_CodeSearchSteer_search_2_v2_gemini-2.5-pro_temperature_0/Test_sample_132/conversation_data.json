    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻) in the solution, the following steps are taken:\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each component:**\n    *   The solution contains 1.00 g of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and 1.00 g of disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n    *   The molar mass of KH₂PO₄ is 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   The molar mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O is 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   KH₂PO₄ provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻).\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻).\n    *   Concentration of [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   Concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   The solution is a buffer system composed of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). This system is governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), Ka₂.\n    *   The equilibrium is: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   The acid dissociation constant expression is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Given Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸, we can solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). This is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka₃.\n    *   The equilibrium is: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   The acid dissociation constant expression is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Given Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹², we can rearrange the formula to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.23x10⁻⁷ M\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value of 6.23x10⁻⁷ M is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
