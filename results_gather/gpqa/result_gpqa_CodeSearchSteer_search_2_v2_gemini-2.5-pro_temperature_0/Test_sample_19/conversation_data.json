    "The \"impulse\" approximation is a foundational concept in many-body nuclear physics that simplifies calculations of interactions, such as electroweak interactions, with a nucleus. It rests on a set of core assumptions about the nature of the interaction and the behavior of the nucleons.\n\nThe key assumptions are:\n*   **Interaction with a single nucleon**: The incoming probe is assumed to interact with only one nucleon at a time. The total interaction with the nucleus is then treated as the incoherent sum of these individual interactions. This is often referred to as the \"one-body current\" assumption.\n*   **Neglect of binding forces during interaction**: The interaction is considered to be so rapid (or \"impulsive\") that the struck nucleon does not have time to interact with its neighbors. Therefore, during the brief moment of the interaction, the nucleon is treated as if it were a free particle, ignoring the binding potential that holds it within the nucleus.\n*   **Neglect of final-state interactions**: In its simplest form, known as the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA), it is assumed that the ejected nucleon leaves the nucleus without any further interactions with the remaining nuclear system. This implies that the residual nucleus is effectively transparent to the outgoing nucleon.\n\nAnalyzing the given options:\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is a core tenet of the impulse approximation.\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This describes the neglect of final-state interactions, a key part of the basic impulse approximation.\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This assumption pertains to the internal structure of the nucleon itself and is part of the quark model. It is not a defining assumption of the impulse approximation, which treats nucleons as the fundamental entities of interaction, not their constituent quarks.\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the central \"impulse\" ideaâ€”that the interaction is too fast for the nuclear binding potential to have an effect during the collision.\n\nBased on this analysis, the three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
