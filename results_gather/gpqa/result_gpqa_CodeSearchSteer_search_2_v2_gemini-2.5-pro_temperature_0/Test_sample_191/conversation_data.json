    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity of the spherical conductor will attract the free electrons within the conductor. This causes a charge of `-q` to accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall electrical neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges located inside it. This means that the distribution of the `+q` charge on the outer surface is completely independent of the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Uniform Charge Distribution:** Due to the symmetrical shape of the outer surface (a sphere), the induced charge `+q` will spread out uniformly over this surface to minimize potential energy.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** According to Gauss's Law (and the Shell Theorem), for any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is identical to that of a single point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, the point P is outside the conductor. The electric field at P is therefore determined solely by the uniform charge `+q` on the outer surface. Since P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor, the magnitude of the electric field is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge.\n\nThe formula is:\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe variables `l`, `s`, and `Î¸`, which describe the position of the charge within the cavity, are irrelevant for calculating the field outside the conductor due to electrostatic shielding.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
