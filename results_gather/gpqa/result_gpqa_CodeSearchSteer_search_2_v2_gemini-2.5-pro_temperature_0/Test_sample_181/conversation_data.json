    "The Mott-Gurney equation is derived based on several key assumptions about the semiconductor device and the nature of charge transport. A critical analysis of these assumptions points to the correct statement.\n\nThe primary assumptions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney law are:\n*   **Single-carrier device:** The current is carried by only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes.\n*   **Trap-free solid:** The model assumes an ideal semiconductor or insulator with no trap states within the energy gap that could capture and immobilize charge carriers. The presence of traps alters the current-voltage relationship.\n*   **Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier):** The contacts must be able to supply an unlimited number of charge carriers into the device. This means there is no energy barrier to charge injection, ensuring the current is limited by the buildup of charge within the device (space-charge) and not by the injection process itself. A Schottky contact, which is rectifying, would introduce an injection barrier.\n*   **Negligible diffusion current:** The derivation of the Mott-Gurney law assumes that the current is dominated by the drift of carriers under the influence of the electric field. The contribution from diffusion, which arises from carrier concentration gradients, is considered negligible.\n\nAnalyzing the given options based on these principles:\n*   A is incorrect because the model applies to single-carrier, not two-carrier, devices.\n*   B is incorrect because a Schottky contact implies a potential barrier to injection, which violates the assumption of an ideal Ohmic contact needed for the current to be purely space-charge-limited.\n*   D is incorrect because it states that drift current is negligible. The Mott-Gurney equation specifically describes a drift-dominated current.\n*   C correctly combines all the necessary conditions: it specifies a trap-free, single-carrier device with no injection barrier (which is the definition of a perfect Ohmic contact in this context) and correctly states that diffusion current is negligible.\n\n<<<C>>>"
