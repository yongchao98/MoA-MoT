    "Based on the spectral data provided, a reasoned structural suggestion for the unidentified white solid is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Here is a breakdown of how the evidence supports this conclusion:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound. The presence of a significant peak at m/z = 158, with an intensity about one-third of the main peak (32%), is a classic isotopic pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom. All the proposed options have a molecular formula of C7H5ClO2, which corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, and all contain chlorine.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows two key features. First, a very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding. Second, the strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid. This evidence strongly points towards a carboxylic acid, effectively ruling out phenyl chloroformate (which lacks an O-H group) and making 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde less likely, as a phenolic O-H stretch is usually less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:** The ¹H NMR data provides the most definitive evidence for the specific isomer.\n    *   The singlet at a downfield shift of 11.0 ppm is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The aromatic region of the spectrum shows two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, with each signal integrating to two protons (2H). This specific pattern—two doublets of equal integration—is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   Combining these observations, 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits perfectly. It is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene with a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom. 2-chlorobenzoic acid, being 1,2-disubstituted, would produce a more complex splitting pattern for its four unique aromatic protons.\n\nTherefore, the combination of all three spectroscopic techniques unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
