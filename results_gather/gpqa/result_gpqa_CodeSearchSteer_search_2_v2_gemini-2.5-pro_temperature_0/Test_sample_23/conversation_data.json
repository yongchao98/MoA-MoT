    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon formed from the hydrogenation of other hydrocarbons, and it does not react further with hydrogen. This indicates Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let the formula for Z be CnHm.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as: `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n*   So, `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`.\n*   The value 0.1428 is equivalent to 1/7.\n*   `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n*   `7m = 12n + m`\n*   `6m = 12n`\n*   `m = 2n`\n*   The general formula for Z is CnH2n. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description.\n*   Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane (C6H12): `(12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428`. This matches perfectly.\n*   Therefore, substance Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reactions and Mixtures**\n\n*   **Hydrogenation:** Both mixture X and mixture Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, yield only cyclohexane (Z). This implies that all constituent compounds in both mixtures are composed of a six-carbon atom ring structure.\n*   **Mixture Y:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated. One of its components is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call the components of Y, C and D. So, D = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12). The other component, C, must also be saturated and must produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. A well-known substance that fits this description is benzene (C6H6). Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water without a catalyst. Under severe conditions (high pressure and temperature), it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   So, mixture Y consists of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12). This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water, and one component is Z. This fits the description.\n\n**3. Deduce the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   **Disproportionation Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation reaction. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is dehydrogenated (oxidized) and another is hydrogenated (reduced).\n*   The reaction is: Mixture X → Mixture Y\n*   Let the components of the equimolar mixture X be A and B.\n*   The reaction is: A + B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   This reaction must be balanced in terms of atoms. The products have a total of 12 carbon atoms (6+6) and 18 hydrogen atoms (6+12). Therefore, the reactants A and B must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms. Since all compounds have a C6 skeleton, A is C6Hx and B is C6Hy, where x + y = 18.\n*   **Properties of Mixture X:**\n    *   It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Let's consider the hydrogen transfer. To form benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12), one reactant must donate hydrogen and the other must accept it. A plausible scenario involves cyclohexene and a cyclohexadiene.\n*   Let's identify A and B. A logical candidate for the hydrogen acceptor is cyclohexene (C6H10). A logical candidate for the hydrogen donor is a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   The reaction would be: Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) + Cyclohexene (C6H10) → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Let's check the atom balance:\n    *   Carbons: 6 + 6 = 12 on the left; 6 + 6 = 12 on the right. (Balanced)\n    *   Hydrogens: 8 + 10 = 18 on the left; 6 + 12 = 18 on the right. (Balanced)\n*   This reaction is a known type of disproportionation called Zelinsky-Kazansky catalysis, where a hydrogen donor (like a diene) and a hydrogen acceptor (like an alkene) react over a platinum catalyst to yield more stable products (an aromatic compound and an alkane).\n*   Now let's check if these components for X fit all conditions:\n    *   **A = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8):** It is unsaturated. The double bonds are not conjugated. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   **B = Cyclohexene (C6H10):** It is unsaturated. It has only one double bond, so no conjugation. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n*   Mixture X = {1,4-Cyclohexadiene, Cyclohexene}. This fits all the given conditions.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>"
