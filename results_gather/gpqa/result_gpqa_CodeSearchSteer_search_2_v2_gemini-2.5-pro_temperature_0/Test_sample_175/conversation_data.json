    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State and Operators\n\n*   The initial state of the system is given by the column matrix (ket vector):\n    `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`\n*   The operator for observable P is:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   The operator for observable Q is:\n    `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n### 2. Normalize the Initial State\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the state vector `|ψ⟩`. The squared norm is:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalization constant is `1/√6`. The normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n\n### 3. Find the Eigenvector for P = 0\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of measuring the value 0 for P. This value must be an eigenvalue of the operator P. We need to find the corresponding eigenvector `|p=0⟩`. The eigenvector equation is `P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`:\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z] = 0 * [x, y, z]`\n\nThis gives the system of equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n\nSo, the eigenvector is of the form `[k, 0, -k]`. To normalize it, we set its length to 1:\n`k² + 0² + (-k)² = 1` => `2k² = 1` => `k = 1/√2`.\nThe normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue `p=0` is:\n`|p=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probability of Measuring P = 0\n\nThe probability of measuring `p=0` is the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the eigenvector `|p=0⟩`.\n`Prob(p=0) = |⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n\nFirst, calculate the inner product `⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩`:\n`⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]] · [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]]`\n`= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n`= (1/√12) * (-2) = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`\n\nNow, square the magnitude:\n`Prob(p=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\n### 5. State Collapse after Measuring P\n\nUpon measuring `p=0`, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector `|p=0⟩`. The new state of the system, `|ψ'⟩`, is:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |p=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n\n### 6. Find the Eigenvector for Q = -1\n\nNext, we measure the observable Q. We want to find the probability of getting the result `q=-1`. The operator Q is a diagonal matrix, so its eigenvalues are its diagonal elements (`1, 0, -1`), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue `q=-1` is:\n`|q=-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]`\n\n### 7. Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q = -1\n\nThe probability of measuring `q=-1` in the new state `|ψ'⟩` is given by:\n`Prob(q=-1 after p=0) = |⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩|²`\n\nCalculate the inner product `⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩`:\n`⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] · [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]]`\n`= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1))`\n`= -1/√2`\n\nNow, square the magnitude:\n`Prob(q=-1 after p=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n### 8. Calculate the Joint Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of the sequence of events: measuring `p=0` and *then* measuring `q=-1`. This is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the steps above.\n`Prob(p=0 and then q=-1) = Prob(p=0) * Prob(q=-1 after p=0)`\n`= (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nThus, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is 1/6.\n\n<<<D>>>"
