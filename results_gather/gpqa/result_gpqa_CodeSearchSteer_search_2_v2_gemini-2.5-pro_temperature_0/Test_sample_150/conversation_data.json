    "To determine the probability that a measurement of the observable `P` will yield the value 0, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics. The process involves finding the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue 0, normalizing the state vector, and then calculating the squared magnitude of the inner product of these two vectors.\n\n**1. Find the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the Operator P**\n\nFirst, we need to find the eigenvalues of the observable operator `P`. The eigenvalues (λ) are the solutions to the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n\nThe operator `P` is given by:\n```\nP =  [ 0, 1/√2,  0 ]\n     [ 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ]\n     [ 0, 1/√2,  0 ]\n```\nThe characteristic equation is:\n```\ndet( [-λ, 1/√2,    0   ] )\n    ( [1/√2,  -λ,  1/√2 ] ) = 0\n    ( [  0,  1/√2,   -λ  ] )\n```\nSolving the determinant gives:\n-λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0\n-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0\n-λ³ + λ = 0\nλ(1 - λ²) = 0\n\nThis gives the eigenvalues λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0. To find this, we need the corresponding eigenvector. An eigenvector `v` for an eigenvalue λ is a non-zero vector that satisfies the equation `(P - λI)v = 0`. For λ = 0, this simplifies to `Pv = 0`.\n\nLet the eigenvector `v₀` be `[x, y, z]ᵀ`.\n```\n[ 0, 1/√2,  0 ] [x]   [0]\n[ 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ] [y] = [0]\n[ 0, 1/√2,  0 ] [z]   [0]\n```\nThis results in the system of equations:\n1.  (1/√2)y = 0  =>  y = 0\n2.  (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  => x + z = 0 => x = -z\n\nThe eigenvector for λ=0 is of the form `(k, 0, -k)`. To make it a unit vector (normalize it), we set its length to 1: `k² + 0² + (-k)² = 1`, which gives `2k² = 1`, so `k = 1/√2`.\nThe normalized eigenvector `v₀` for the eigenvalue 0 is `(1/√2, 0, -1/√2)`.\n\n**2. Normalize the State Vector**\n\nThe state of the system at time `t` is given by the column matrix `ψ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`. Before calculating the probability, this state vector must be normalized. The norm squared is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\nThe normalized state vector `ψ_norm` is:\n`ψ_norm = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability**\n\nThe probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the normalized state vector onto the corresponding normalized eigenvector. This is given by the formula `Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n\nFor the eigenvalue 0, the probability is `Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n\nFirst, calculate the inner product `⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩`:\n`⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] . (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`\n`= (1/√12) * [(1 * -1) + (0 * 2) + (-1 * 1)]`\n`= (1/√12) * (-1 - 1)`\n`= -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`\n\nFinally, the probability is the square of the magnitude of this value:\n`Prob(0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`.\n\nThus, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
