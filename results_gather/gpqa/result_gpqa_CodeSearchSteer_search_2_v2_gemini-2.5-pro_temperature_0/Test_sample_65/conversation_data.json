    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory that extends the Standard Model (SM) with higher-dimensional operators. The symmetries that must be respected by all operators in this framework are determined by its fundamental assumptions.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** SMEFT is, by construction, a Lorentz-invariant theory. All operators are built from SM fields and their derivatives in a way that they transform as scalars under Lorentz transformations.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry:** This symmetry group includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. As a fundamental spacetime symmetry of quantum field theory, it is a core assumption in the construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model. SMEFT, as an extension of the SM, not only incorporates this but also provides a framework for parameterizing new, additional sources of CP violation. There is a large number of CP-violating operators within SMEFT that are actively studied. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem, a cornerstone of quantum field theory, states that any local, Lorentz-invariant theory must also be invariant under the combined transformation of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is defined to be a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, all of its operators must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on this, Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT.\n\n<<<B>>>"
