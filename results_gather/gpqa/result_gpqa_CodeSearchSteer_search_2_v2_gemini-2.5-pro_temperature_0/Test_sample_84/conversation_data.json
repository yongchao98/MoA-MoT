    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can follow a step-by-step derivation using fundamental principles of exoplanet characterization.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its parent star. It is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from the star and the energy radiated back into space. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * √(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\n### 2. Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * √(R_star / (2 * a₁)) * (1 - A₁)^(1/4)] / [T_star * √(R_star / (2 * a₂)) * (1 - A₂)^(1/4)]\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are constant. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (`A₁ = A₂`). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n### 3. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters\nThe problem provides the Doppler shifts caused by the planets, which is information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The maximum radial velocity of the star induced by a planet (the semi-amplitude, K) is related to the planet's mass and orbit. For a circular orbit, and assuming the planet's mass (`M_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), the formula is:\n\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nWhere `i` is the orbital inclination and `G` is the gravitational constant. Since the planets were detected by both transit and RV methods, we can assume the orbits are edge-on, meaning `i` ≈ 90° and `sin(i)` ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\n### 4. Deriving the Semi-Major Axis\nWe can rearrange the RV formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\nK² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n### 5. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nNow we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁. The terms `G` and `M_star` are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²)]\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 6. Connecting Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ`. The relationship is `K = c * (Δλ / λ₀)`, where `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n### 7. Final Calculation\nSubstitute this back into the equation for `a₂ / a₁`:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, substitute this entire expression into the simplified temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √[(M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\nFinally, plug in the given values:\n*   M_p₁ = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p₂ = 5 M_earth\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>"
