    "To determine the energies of the system, we must first understand the behavior of spin-1/2 particles (fermions) in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. These particles are governed by the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L is given by:\nE_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²). Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\nE_n = n² * E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nFor each energy level 'n', there are two possible spin states: spin-up and spin-down. This means each energy level can hold a maximum of two particles.\n\nThe first few single-particle energy levels are:\n*   E₁ = 1² * E = 1E\n*   E₂ = 2² * E = 4E\n*   E₃ = 3² * E = 9E\n*   E₄ = 4² * E = 16E\n\n**2. Ground State Energy:**\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   Two particles go into the n=1 level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   The remaining two particles go into the n=2 level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n**3. First Excited State Energy:**\n\nTo find the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the next available unoccupied level.\n*   The ground state configuration is two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n**4. Second Excited State Energy:**\n\nFor the second excited state, we must find the next lowest energy configuration possible after the first excited state. There are a few possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n*   **Option A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration would be one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Option B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration would be two particles in n=1 and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Option C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration would be two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing these energies, the lowest energy configuration after the first excited state (15E) is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state energy is **18E**.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<C>>>"
