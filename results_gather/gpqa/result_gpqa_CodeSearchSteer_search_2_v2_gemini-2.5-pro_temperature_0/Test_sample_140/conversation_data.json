    "The reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways, forming two distinct benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the hydrogen from C-6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium remains at C-2.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuterium from C-2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 creates a different benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2.\n\nIt is worth noting that due to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is broken more easily than the C-D bond, so Pathway A is faster. However, both pathways are possible and lead to two different, isomeric benzyne intermediates.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide anion (NH₂⁻), then attacks the highly reactive benzyne intermediates. The attack can occur at either carbon of the strained triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, liquid ammonia.\n\n**Analysis of Products from Benzyne A (triple bond C1-C6):**\n*   **Attack at C-1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-1. The resulting anion at C-6 is protonated by ammonia. The final product is aniline with the deuterium at C-2, which is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n*   **Attack at C-6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-6. The resulting anion at C-1 is protonated. The final product is again **2-deuterioaniline**.\n\nTherefore, Benzyne A leads to only one product: 2-deuterioaniline.\n\n**Analysis of Products from Benzyne B (triple bond C1-C2):**\n*   **Attack at C-1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-1. The anion forms at C-2 (the carbon with the deuterium). Protonation by ammonia yields aniline with the amino group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n*   **Attack at C-2:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-2. The anion forms at C-1. Protonation by ammonia yields aniline with the amino group at C-2 and the deuterium still at C-2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the attack on Benzyne B.\n*   Attack at C-1 gives aniline with NH₂ at C-1 and D at C-2. This is 2-deuterioaniline.\n*   Attack at C-2 gives aniline with NH₂ at C-2 and an anion at C-1. Protonation of C-1 gives aniline with NH₂ at C-2 and D at C-3 (relative to the new amino group). This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nLet's trace the positions carefully for the second case (attack at C-2 of Benzyne B):\n1.  Start: 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene.\n2.  Benzyne B formation: Remove D from C-2 and Br from C-1. The triple bond is between C-1 and C-2. The other ring positions (C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6) have hydrogens.\n3.  Nucleophilic attack: NH₂⁻ attacks C-2. An anion forms at C-1.\n4.  Protonation: The anion at C-1 is protonated by NH₃.\n5.  Final Product: The -NH₂ group is on C-2. The original C-3 is now meta to the amino group. The original C-1 is now ortho to the amino group. Since no deuterium was on C-3, this product is **3-aminobenzene-d1**, which is **m-deuterioaniline** or **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nTherefore, the possible products are:\n*   From Benzyne A: 2-deuterioaniline\n*   From Benzyne B: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline\n\nCombining these, there are two unique possible organic products: **2-deuterioaniline** and **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nThe correct count of possible organic products is 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
