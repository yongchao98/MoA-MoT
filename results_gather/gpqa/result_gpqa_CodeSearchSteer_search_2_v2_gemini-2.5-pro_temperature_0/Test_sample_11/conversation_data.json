    "Here is a step-by-step calculation for the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺).\n\nThe decay process is:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν(μ)\n\nGiven:\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The π⁺ is stationary, meaning its initial momentum is zero.\n*   The muon neutrino (ν) is considered to have zero rest mass for this calculation.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum**\nSince the initial pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν) must move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes.\n*   p_μ = p_ν = p\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy**\nThe initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n*   E_initial = m_π * c²\n*   E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its rest mass (m) and momentum (p) by the equation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   For the muon (μ⁺): E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n*   For the massless neutrino (ν): E_ν = pc\n\nApplying the conservation of energy:\nm_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\nTo solve for the momentum (p), we can rearrange and square the equation:\nm_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²) (pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nSimplifying the equation by canceling the (pc)² terms:\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²) (pc) = (m_μc²)²\n\nNow, we solve for pc (the momentum-energy term):\npc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\npc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\npc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / [279.2]\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2\npc ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n**3. Calculating the Kinetic Energies (KE)**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    For a massless particle, the kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\n    KE_ν = E_ν = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n    The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy (KE = E - mc²).\n    First, find the total energy of the muon:\n    E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n    E_μ = √((29.8)² + (105.7)²)\n    E_μ = √(888.04 + 11172.49)\n    E_μ = √(12060.53)\n    E_μ ≈ 109.82 MeV\n\n    Now, calculate the kinetic energy:\n    KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²\n    KE_μ = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV\n    KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.\n\n<<<D>>>"
