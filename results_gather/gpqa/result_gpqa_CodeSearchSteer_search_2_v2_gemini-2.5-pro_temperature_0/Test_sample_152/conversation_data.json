    "Here is a breakdown of the three reactions to determine the correct products and reactants.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)\n\n1.  **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate is a classic Michael donor. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), removes a proton from the carbon between the two ester groups, creating a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon is electrophilic and will be attacked by the nucleophilic enolate.\n3.  **Reaction:** The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. Subsequent protonation (from the ethanol solvent or during workup) of the α-carbon yields the final product.\n4.  **Product (A):** The new bond forms between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. The resulting structure is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) → (B)\n\n1.  **Michael Donor:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis. 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon.\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n3.  **Reaction:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This is followed by hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). The hydrolysis step converts the intermediate iminium salt back into a ketone.\n4.  **Product (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (carbon 2) with the remnant of the nitrile. The resulting molecule is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Retrosynthesis:** This is a Michael addition where we need to identify the starting Michael donor (C). The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** The acceptor is but-3-en-2-one, commonly known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). The \"3-oxobutyl\" group in the product comes directly from MVK after the reaction.\n3.  **Michael Donor (C):** The reaction forms a bond between the β-carbon of MVK and the nucleophilic carbon of the donor. Since the 3-oxobutyl group is attached to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring, the donor must be the enolate of **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The proton at C2 is particularly acidic because it is positioned between two carbonyl groups, making it easy to deprotonate with KOH to form the required nucleophile. This type of reaction is a key step in the Robinson annulation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of each reaction:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
