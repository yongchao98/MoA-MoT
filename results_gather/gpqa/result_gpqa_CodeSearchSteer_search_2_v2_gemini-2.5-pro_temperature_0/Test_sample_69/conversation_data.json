    "This chemical riddle presents a series of reactions to identify several unknown substances, culminating in determining the molecular symmetry of product E. A step-by-step deduction based on the provided chemical reactions and properties is required.\n\nFirst, let's identify the substances involved:\n\n*   **Reaction 3: C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)**: This hydrolysis reaction is a key clue. The fact that product C reacts with water to reform the initial solid reactant A, along with two different acids (one strong, one weak), strongly suggests that C is a salt where part of it hydrolyzes. The formation of a strong and a weak acid is characteristic of the hydrolysis of certain non-metal halides, particularly those of phosphorus. For instance, phosphorus pentachloride (PCl₅) hydrolyzes to produce phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄, a weak acid) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, a strong acid).\n\n*   **Reaction 4: D + B (1:1 ratio) → H (solvent)**: This describes a simple addition reaction between two gases, B and D, to form a solvent, H.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → Bright red product C**: This reaction describes the formation of C. While many inorganic compounds can be red, the stoichiometry and other clues must align.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: C + 2 equivalents of gas D → Extremely hazardous product E**: This reaction forms the final product of interest, E, which is described as \"extremely hazardous.\"\n\nLet's try to piece together the identities. If we assume the hydrolysis clue points to phosphorus and chlorine chemistry, we can propose:\n*   **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine, a gas)\n*   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid)\n*   **G = H₃PO₄** (Phosphoric acid, a weak acid)\n*   **C** is a phosphorus chloride compound.\n\nNow, let's identify D and H using Reaction 4:\n*   If B is Cl₂ and D is a gas that reacts in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent, a very strong candidate for D is carbon monoxide (CO).\n*   **D = CO** (Carbon monoxide, a gas)\n*   **H = COCl₂** (Phosgene), which is formed from CO + Cl₂ → COCl₂. Phosgene is a liquid at room temperature (boiling point 8.3 °C) and is used as a solvent and reagent.\n\nFinally, we can identify the extremely hazardous product E from Reaction 2:\n*   **C + 2D → E**\n*   If C is a phosphorus chloride and D is CO, we must find a reaction that produces E. A known reaction is the reaction of phosphorus pentachloride (PCl₅) with carbon monoxide. While the stoichiometry can vary, a key product of this reaction is phosgene (COCl₂).\n*   Given that H is also phosgene, and E is described as extremely hazardous (a primary characteristic of phosgene), it is highly probable that **E is phosgene (COCl₂)**. The riddle likely contains some inconsistencies, a common trait in such puzzles, but the chemical signposts point strongly toward this conclusion.\n\nNow, we determine the molecular symmetry group of E (phosgene, COCl₂).\nPhosgene has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. The molecule is planar. Its structure gives it the following symmetry elements:\n1.  A two-fold rotational axis (C₂) passing through the C=O bond.\n2.  A mirror plane (σᵥ) that contains all the atoms (the molecular plane).\n3.  A second mirror plane (σᵥ') that is perpendicular to the molecular plane and bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n\nA molecule with a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of the extremely hazardous product E (phosgene) is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<D>>>"
