    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** This tube reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ molecules, the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. This indicates it is a relatively inert gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂), a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nFrom the moles of the products, we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 mol H/mol H₂O = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 0.10 mol N₂ × 2 mol N/mol N₂ = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is present in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (0.20 mol H₂O × 1 mol O/mol H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 mol O/mol O₂)\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol O.\n\nLet's check if the mass of these elements equals the initial mass of the mixture:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming that salts A and B consist only of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles for both salt A and salt B. The total moles of elements are the sum from both salts.\n\nThe overall molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get integers, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n*   N: 1, H: 2, O: 1.25. Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThis means that the sum of the chemical formulas of salt A and salt B is N₄H₈O₅. Since the compounds are salts containing N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts. We need to find two common ammonium salts that add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\nLet's try combining ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃ → Formula: N₂H₄O₃\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂ → Formula: N₂H₄O₂\n\nSum of formulas = (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This matches our derived ratio.\n\nNow, let's verify this with the decomposition reactions. The thermal decomposition of these salts at around 200°C produces the observed gases:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g) (This is the primary reaction, but at higher temperatures or with impurities, it can also produce N₂ and O₂). A more complete decomposition that fits the products is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + 4H₂O + O₂.\n\nLet's assume the reactions are:\n*   n NH₄NO₂ → n N₂ + 2n H₂O\n*   n NH₄NO₃ → n N₂ + 2n H₂O + 0.5n O₂\n\nTotal products would be:\n*   Moles of N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Moles of H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   Moles of O₂ = 0.5n\n\nFrom our initial analysis, we have 0.10 mol N₂, 0.20 mol H₂O, and 0.025 mol O₂.\n*   2n = 0.10 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n*   4n = 0.20 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n*   0.5n = 0.025 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n\nThe value of n = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nFinally, we count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>"
