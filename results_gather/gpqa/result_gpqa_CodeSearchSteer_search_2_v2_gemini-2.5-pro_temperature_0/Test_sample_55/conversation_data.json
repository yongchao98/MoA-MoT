    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state to a final state via two dipole transitions is governed by a set of selection rules. These rules dictate which transitions are possible based on the change in the quantum numbers *n*, *l*, and *m*.\n\nThe process in question is a cascade decay from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state. This cannot happen in a single step because the orbital angular momentum quantum number, *l*, would have to remain 0, which violates the dipole selection rule that requires Δ*l* = ±1. Therefore, the decay must proceed through an intermediate state.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩**\n\n*   **Initial State:** |*n*=3, *l*=0, *m*=0⟩.\n*   **Selection Rules for Dipole Transitions:**\n    *   Δ*l* = *l'* - *l* = ±1. Since the initial *l* is 0, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n    *   Δ*m* = *m'* - *m* = 0, ±1. Since the initial *m* is 0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = 0, +1, or -1.\n*   The principal quantum number *n* must decrease, so *n'* < 3. A common intermediate state is *n'*=2.\n\nBased on these rules, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state to the final state |1,0,0⟩**\n\n*   **Final State:** |*n*=1, *l*=0, *m*=0⟩.\n*   Let's check the transitions from the possible intermediate states:\n    *   From |2,1,*m'*⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.\n    *   Δ*l* = *l*<sub>final</sub> - *l'* = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the selection rule for all possible intermediate states.\n    *   Δ*m* = *m*<sub>final</sub> - *m'* = 0 - *m'*. This must be 0 or ±1. This condition is met for *m'* = 0, +1, and -1.\n\nThus, all three decay routes are physically possible:\n1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (*l*=0). This means there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the first photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the allowed magnetic sublevels (*m'*) of the *l'*=1 state.\n\nThe total transition probability is the sum of the probabilities to each of the three intermediate states: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩. Because of the initial state's symmetry, the probabilities for transitioning to each of these three states are equal.\n\nP(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)\n\nSince these are the only three possible paths for the first step of the cascade, the sum of their probabilities must be 1. Therefore, the probability for any single path is 1/3.\n\nThe question asks for the transition route and its corresponding probability. Let's examine the options provided:\n*   **A) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/3:** This route is valid, and the calculated probability for this specific path is 1/3.\n*   **B) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3:** The probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4:** The probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4:** The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe probability of the entire cascade is determined by the probability of the first step, as the second transition (e.g., from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩) is the only allowed dipole decay path to a lower energy level and thus has a probability of 1. Therefore, the probability of the specific cascade |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is 1/3.\n\nThe correct answer is the one that identifies a valid route with the correct probability.\n\n<<<A>>>"
