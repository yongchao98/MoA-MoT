  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s).

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Single Mutants\n*   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 function causes a 25% reduction in resistance. This means G1 plays a role in the plant's defense.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function causes a 50% reduction in resistance. This means G3 also contributes to defense, and its contribution is larger than G1's.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function completely eliminates resistance. This indicates that G2 is an essential gene for this resistance pathway.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Double Mutants to Determine Epistasis\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation masks the effect of another gene's mutation. In a double mutant, the phenotype will resemble one of the single mutants.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g1` single mutant (75% resistance). Therefore, the `g2` mutation is **epistatic** to the `g1` mutation.\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g3` single mutant (50% resistance). Therefore, the `g2` mutation is also **epistatic** to the `g3` mutation.\n\n### 3. Identify the Transcription Factor\nThe problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of other genes. In a genetic pathway, an epistatic gene typically acts upstream of the gene it masks. Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, it must be the upstream gene. This makes **G2 the transcription factor** that likely regulates the expression of G1 and G3.\n\n### 4. Analyze the g1g3 Double Mutant\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance.\n*   This phenotype (10% resistance) is not the same as the `g1` mutant (75%) or the `g3` mutant (50%). Therefore, there is no simple epistatic relationship between G1 and G3.\n*   The loss of resistance in the double mutant is 90%. The sum of the individual losses is 25% (from g1) + 50% (from g3) = 75%. Since the observed loss (90%) is greater than the sum of the individual losses, G1 and G3 have a **synergistic interaction**. They work together, and the loss of both is more detrimental than expected.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Options\nBased on the analysis:\n*   G2 is the transcription factor.\n*   G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.\n*   G1 and G3 interact synergistically.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** Incorrect. G2 is the transcription factor, not G1.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** Incorrect. \"Pleiotropy\" is the wrong term (it means one gene affects multiple traits). Also, G1 is not epistatic towards G3 (the g1g3 phenotype is 10%, not 75%).\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor. The term \"gene redundancy\" is not perfectly accurate (the interaction is synergistic), but it is more plausible than \"pleiotropy\" as it suggests G1 and G3 have related functions. The statement \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is factually incorrect based on the data. However, among the flawed options, this one may be considered the \"best fit\" by correctly identifying the transcription factor and using a term (\"redundancy\") that loosely describes two genes contributing to the same function. The final clause is an error in the question's options.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** Incorrect. We cannot conclude they have the same promoter from this data, and G3 is not epistatic towards G1 (the g1g3 phenotype is 10%, not 50%).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll options contain inaccuracies when compared strictly with the provided data. However, option C correctly identifies the main conclusion of the experiment: **G2 is the transcription factor**. The other descriptions in option C are flawed but are arguably the \"least incorrect\" compared to the other options. \"Gene redundancy\" is a better functional description than \"pleiotropy,\" and the claim of epistasis between G1 and G3 is a common error in such questions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
