    "The state of a composite quantum system can be described in a coupled or uncoupled basis. In this problem, the state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis, denoted by $|l, m\\rangle$, where $l$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number and $m$ is the magnetic quantum number, representing the projection of the total orbital angular momentum onto the z-axis. The individual angular momentum states are represented in the uncoupled basis by $|l_1, m_1\\rangle$ and $|l_2, m_2\\rangle$.\n\nThe key principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This is expressed by the quantum number relationship:\n\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nThis relationship is a fundamental selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which are the expansion coefficients that relate the coupled basis to the uncoupled basis. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is zero unless the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is met.\n\nIn this specific problem:\n*   The system is in the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$. This means the total magnetic quantum number is **m = -1**.\n*   We are asked for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of the individual z-component angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, to both be $-\\hbar$.\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is given by $m\\hbar$. Therefore, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n*   Similarly, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\nNow, we check if the selection rule is satisfied for this measurement outcome:\n\n$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\nThe system is in a state where the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$. However, the proposed measurement outcome corresponds to a total magnetic quantum number of $m = -2$. Since $-1 \\neq -2$, this violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\nThe probability of measuring a particular uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$ from a coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ is given by the square of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n\n$P(m_1, m_2) = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$\n\nBecause the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero. Consequently, the probability of this measurement is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
