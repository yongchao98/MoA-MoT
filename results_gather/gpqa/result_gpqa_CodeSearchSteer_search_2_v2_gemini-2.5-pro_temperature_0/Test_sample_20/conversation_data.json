    "### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more interconvertible forms that differ in the position of a proton and an electron. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is a necessary condition.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** In the structure of benzoquinone, the carbon atoms adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of a double bond within the ring. These carbons do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Therefore, benzoquinone lacks the required alpha-hydrogens and cannot exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has alpha-hydrogens on the carbons situated between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6). These hydrogens can migrate, allowing the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form is phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is particularly stable due to its aromatic character. The existence of this keto-enol equilibrium has been confirmed by experimental studies.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (D and L forms).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure (CH₃OOC)CH=CH(COOCH₃) and is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. Due to the carbon-carbon double bond, the molecule is planar. This planarity results in a plane of symmetry, which makes the molecule achiral. Achiral molecules are not optically active.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Answer Determination**\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
