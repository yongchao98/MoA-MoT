    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics for binary stars. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass of the system (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M_total = M₁ + M₂) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂).\n\nThe formula for the total mass is:\nM_total = [P * (K₁ + K₂)^3] / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n\nHere, G is the gravitational constant, and 'i' is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight. The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses, which means we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on. For an eclipsing binary, the inclination 'i' is very close to 90 degrees, making sin(i) approximately equal to 1. This simplifies the calculation significantly.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_sys1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_sys2).\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₁_₁ and K₁_₂): 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K_total1): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₂_₁ and K₂_₂): 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K_total2): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio of the masses:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = { [P₁ * (K_total1)³] / (2πG) } / { [P₂ * (K_total2)³] / (2πG) }\n\nThe term (2πG) cancels out, simplifying the expression to:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = (P₁ / P₂) * (K_total1 / K_total2)³\n\nPlugging in the values for the two systems:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = (2 years / 1 year) * (15 km/s / 25 km/s)³\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (3/5)³\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 54 / 125\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.432. Comparing this to the given options, the closest value is 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
