    "The search results confirm the standard definition of the abundance notation [X/Y]. Specifically, `[X/Y] = log10(nX/nY)_star - log10(nX/nY)_sun`. My derivation is based on this definition and is therefore correct. The problem is a straightforward application of this formula, and the extraneous information about stellar masses and specific solar abundances is not needed for the final calculation. The calculation proceeds as outlined in my thought process.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Star 1 to find its silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio, (nSi/nH)₁.**\n    *   We are given `[Fe/H]₁ = 0`, which means `log₁₀((nFe/nH)₁) - log₁₀((nFe/nH)sun) = 0`. This simplifies to `log₁₀((nFe/nH)₁) = log₁₀((nFe/nH)sun)`.\n    *   We are also given `[Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3`, which means `log₁₀((nSi/nFe)₁) - log₁₀((nSi/nFe)sun) = 0.3`.\n    *   Expanding the `log` terms gives: `log₁₀((nSi/nH)₁) - log₁₀((nFe/nH)₁) - (log₁₀((nSi/nH)sun) - log₁₀((nFe/nH)sun)) = 0.3`.\n    *   Since `log₁₀((nFe/nH)₁) = log₁₀((nFe/nH)sun)`, these terms cancel out, leaving: `log₁₀((nSi/nH)₁) - log₁₀((nSi/nH)sun) = 0.3`.\n    *   This is equivalent to `[Si/H]₁ = 0.3`.\n    *   Therefore, `(nSi/nH)₁ = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nH)sun`.\n\n2.  **Analyze Star 2 to find its silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio, (nSi/nH)₂.**\n    *   We are given `[Mg/H]₂ = 0`, which means `log₁₀((nMg/nH)₂) - log₁₀((nMg/nH)sun) = 0`. This simplifies to `log₁₀((nMg/nH)₂) = log₁₀((nMg/nH)sun)`.\n    *   We are also given `[Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3`, which means `log₁₀((nMg/nSi)₂) - log₁₀((nMg/nSi)sun) = 0.3`.\n    *   Expanding the `log` terms gives: `log₁₀((nMg/nH)₂) - log₁₀((nSi/nH)₂) - (log₁₀((nMg/nH)sun) - log₁₀((nSi/nH)sun)) = 0.3`.\n    *   Since `log₁₀((nMg/nH)₂) = log₁₀((nMg/nH)sun)`, these terms cancel out, leaving: `-log₁₀((nSi/nH)₂) + log₁₀((nSi/nH)sun) = 0.3`.\n    *   Rearranging for the silicon abundance in Star 2 gives: `log₁₀((nSi/nH)₂) = log₁₀((nSi/nH)sun) - 0.3`.\n    *   This is equivalent to `[Si/H]₂ = -0.3`.\n    *   Therefore, `(nSi/nH)₂ = 10^-0.3 * (nSi/nH)sun`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the ratio of silicon atoms.**\n    *   The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres, which corresponds to the ratio of their abundance fractions: `(nSi/nH)₁ / (nSi/nH)₂`.\n    *   Ratio = `(10^0.3 * (nSi/nH)sun) / (10^-0.3 * (nSi/nH)sun)`\n    *   The solar abundance term `(nSi/nH)sun` cancels out.\n    *   Ratio = `10^0.3 / 10^-0.3 = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) = 10^0.6`.\n    *   `10^0.6 ≈ 3.981`.\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\n<<<D>>>"
