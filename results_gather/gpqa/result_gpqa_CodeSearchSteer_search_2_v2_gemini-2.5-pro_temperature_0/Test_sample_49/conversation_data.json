    "The number of loops in a Feynman diagram can be determined from the mathematical expression for its contribution to a physical process. In the provided expression, the key is the factor of `1/(4pi)^6`.\n\nIn quantum field theory calculations, particularly when using a technique called dimensional regularization, each loop in a Feynman diagram introduces a factor of `1/(4pi)^2` in four-dimensional spacetime. This factor arises from the integration over the undetermined momentum flowing through the loop.\n\nThe expression given is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nWe can isolate the loop-dependent term: `1/(4pi)^6`.\n\nIf `L` is the number of loops, the total factor from all loops would be `(1/(4pi)^2)^L`. To match the expression, we must have:\n\n`(1/(4pi)^2)^L = 1/(4pi)^6`\n\nThis implies `2L = 6`, which means `L = 3`.\n\nThe other parts of the expression relate to different aspects of the diagram:\n*   `alpha^3 * g^2`: The powers of the coupling constants (`alpha` and `g`) relate to the number of interaction vertices in the diagram. In this case, there are a total of five vertices.\n*   `sqrt(2) * 8`: These are numerical factors that result from the specific details of the calculation.\n*   `(Q/M)^2`: This is a ratio of energy scales squared, which arises from the evaluation of the loop integrals and depends on the masses and external momenta involved.\n\nWhile all these factors are important for the final value, the power of `4pi` is the most direct indicator of the number of loops. Therefore, the diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
