    "The analysis of the chemical problem proceeds in several steps:\n\n1.  **Identifying the Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride shows a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum (137 ppm and 165 ppm). This spectroscopic data is characteristic of maleic anhydride. The molecule's symmetry makes the two vinylic protons equivalent (giving one ¹H signal) and the two alkene carbons and two carbonyl carbons equivalent (giving two ¹³C signals). The chemical shifts are appropriate for vinylic protons (~7 ppm), alkene carbons (~137 ppm), and carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm).\n\n2.  **Identifying the Reaction:** The anhydride (maleic anhydride) reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a classic [4+2] cycloaddition known as the Diels-Alder reaction. Maleic anhydride acts as the dienophile, and the substituted cyclopentadiene acts as the diene.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Products:** The reaction yields two products, a major and a minor one, both with the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃. In Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes, two stereoisomeric products can form: the *endo* and the *exo* adduct. The *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored and therefore major product, formed due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The *exo* product is generally the thermodynamically more stable, but minor, product. Thus, the major product is the *endo* isomer and the minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n\n4.  **Distinguishing Products with NOESY NMR:** A 2D NOESY experiment detects protons that are close to each other in space (through-space correlation), which is ideal for distinguishing between *endo* and *exo* isomers. A cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor one points to a unique spatial relationship in the *endo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Structural and Spectral Analysis:**\n    *   **Symmetry and Proton Signals:** The resulting bicyclic product has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two methyl groups on the double bond equivalent (a 6H singlet), the two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons equivalent (another 6H singlet), and the two protons on the anhydride portion of the ring equivalent (a 2H singlet).\n    *   **Chemical Shift Assignments:**\n        *   The protons on the anhydride part (let's call them H_succinyl) are alpha to carbonyl groups and are typically found around 3.5 ppm. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   The methyl groups on the double bond (Me_alkene) are vinylic methyls and are expected to be more deshielded than saturated methyls. They correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   The methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons (Me_bridgehead) would be further upfield, corresponding to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   The remaining signal, a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, belongs to one of the protons on the methylene bridge.\n    *   ***Endo* vs. *Exo* Geometry:**\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the newly formed six-membered ring. This geometry brings the H_succinyl protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene, ~1.7 ppm).\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the double bond. In this arrangement, the H_succinyl protons are far from the Me_alkene groups but are close to the methylene bridge protons and the bridgehead methyl groups.\n    *   **The Decisive Cross-Peak:** The NOESY cross-peak observed in the major product but not the minor product must be due to the interaction that is unique to the *endo* geometry. This is the close proximity between the H_succinyl protons and the Me_alkene protons. Therefore, the cross-peak connects the resonance at ~3.5 ppm (2H singlet) and the resonance at ~1.7 ppm (6H singlet).\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
