Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in the molecule's stable conformation.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Substituents:** The positions ortho to the inter-ring bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted.\n        *   At positions 2 and 2', there are dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n        *   At positions 6 and 6', there are nitro groups (-NO2).\n    *   **Chirality Check:** In biphenyls, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions, they can clash with each other, preventing free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings. This restricted rotation is called \"atropisomerism\".\n    *   The nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups are sufficiently bulky to hinder rotation. This locks the two phenyl rings in a non-planar (twisted) conformation.\n    *   Next, we check for symmetry. In this twisted conformation, there is no plane of symmetry that can cut the molecule into two identical halves, nor is there a center of inversion.\n    *   Because the molecule is non-planar and lacks these symmetry elements, it is chiral. Chiral molecules can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and thus exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 1 shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** Let's break down the name. \"Propanoate\" indicates a 3-carbon chain with a carboxylate group. \"Methyl\" means it's an ester with a methyl group (CH3O-). \"2-hydroxy\" means an -OH group is on carbon-2. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This compound is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** We look for a chiral center. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine Carbon-2 (the one with the -OH group):\n        1.  It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        2.  It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3).\n        3.  It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3).\n        4.  It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n    *   Since Carbon-2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 2 shows optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Analyze Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It's a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Chirality Check:**\n        *   There is no carbon atom with four different single-bonded substituents, so there is no chiral center.\n        *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry. A plane can be imagined passing through the C=O bond and bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 3 does not show optical isomerism.\n\n5.  **Analyze Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** Fumarate is the trans-isomer of butenedioate. Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups (-COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Check:**\n        *   There are no chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule itself is a plane of symmetry. It also possesses a center of inversion (a point in the middle of the C=C bond).\n    *   The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 4 does not show optical isomerism.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound 1 is optically active (due to atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2 is optically active (due to a chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3 is not optically active (achiral).\n    *   Compound 4 is not optically active (achiral).\n\n    Therefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism:**\n    Optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism where a molecule is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack any improper axis of rotation (S_n), which includes planes of symmetry (S_1) and centers of inversion (S_2). The most common features leading to chirality are:\n    1.  **Chiral Center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n    2.  **Axial Chirality:** Chirality arising from restricted rotation around a single bond, as seen in some substituted biphenyls (atropisomers), allenes, and spiranes.\n    3.  **Planar Chirality:** Chirality arising from a plane in the molecule, as seen in compounds like ansa compounds or trans-cyclooctene.\n\n*   **Evaluation of each compound:**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   This is a biphenyl compound substituted at all four ortho-positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6').\n        *   The substituents are nitro groups (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These are bulky groups.\n        *   The steric hindrance caused by these bulky ortho-substituents prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism.\n        *   Because rotation is restricted, the molecule is locked into a specific conformation. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n        *   As a result, it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This is a classic example of axial chirality.\n        *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group, -OH).\n        *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n        *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n        *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism (existing as R- and S-enantiomers).\n\n    3.  **benzophenone:**\n        *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A central carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n        *   The molecule does not have a chiral center. The central carbon is sp² hybridized.\n        *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. It has a C₂ rotational axis passing through the C=O bond. Even in its twisted, low-energy conformation, its mirror image is superimposable upon the original molecule.\n        *   Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid).\n        *   Its structure is trans-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n        *   The molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n        *   Additionally, the molecule has a center of inversion (or center of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n        *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, compounds 1 (due to axial chirality/atropisomerism) and 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral.\n\nThus, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The user wants to identify which of the four given organic compounds can exhibit optical isomerism.\n2.  **Define Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups), but other sources exist, such as axial chirality (atropisomerism). A key test for chirality is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. If a molecule has either of these symmetry elements, it is **achiral** and will not be optically active.\n\n3.  **Analyze each compound:**\n\n    *   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n        *   **Key Feature:** The positions ortho to the linking bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** These large groups cause significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This restricted rotation forces the rings to be non-coplanar. The resulting twisted conformation lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. This type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation about a single bond, is called **atropisomerism**. Since the molecule is chiral, it will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n        *   **Key Feature:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2, which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter). The presence of a single chiral center in a molecule makes it chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism (existing as R and S enantiomers).\n\n    *   **3. benzophenone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a ketone with the formula (C6H5)2CO or Ph-C(=O)-Ph.\n        *   **Key Feature:** The central carbon is part of a carbonyl group (C=O), so it's sp2 hybridized and bonded to only three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen). It cannot be a chiral center.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry**. Imagine a plane cutting through the C=O bond and bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings. The left half of the molecule is a mirror image of the right half. Because it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **4. dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is trans-CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.\n        *   **Key Feature:** It is a planar molecule due to the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. It also has a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself). The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Compound 1 is chiral (atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2 is chiral (chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3 is achiral (plane of symmetry).\n    *   Compound 4 is achiral (center of inversion and plane of symmetry).\n\n    Therefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn organic compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. In biphenyl systems, if the four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky substituents, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is hindered due to steric strain.\n    *   **Analysis:** In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6', and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'. This steric hindrance prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar. The molecule is forced into a stable, twisted conformation. This molecule lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. As a result, it is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable. This type of stereoisomerism is called atropisomerism, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Analysis:** To check for chirality, we look for asymmetric carbon atoms (chiral centers). A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine carbon-2 (the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group):\n        *   It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n        *   It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        *   It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n        Since all four groups attached to carbon-2 are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and therefore it shows optical isomerism. It exists as two enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized, bonded to only three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl rings), so it cannot be a chiral center.

A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar.

The presence of a **chiral center** (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups).\n2.  The presence of **axial chirality**, where rotation around a bond is restricted, leading to a structure that lacks a plane of symmetry (e.g., atropisomerism in biphenyls).\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The positions ortho to the connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). These bulky groups sterically hinder each other, preventing free rotation around the single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation forces the rings to be twisted out of the same plane. In this twisted, non-planar conformation, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or the presence of an element of axial or planar chirality. A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Step-by-step Analysis of Each Compound:**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative where the two phenyl rings are linked by a single C-C bond.\n        *   **Chirality:** In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), free rotation around the central C-C single bond is hindered. In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, can lead to chirality if the molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry.\n        *   **Symmetry:** The substitution pattern on each ring is asymmetric (a -COOCH3 group at position 2 and a -NO2 group at position 6). Due to the restricted rotation and the lack of symmetry, the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The molecule possesses axial chirality and is therefore optically active.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is an ester with the formula CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. It is also known as methyl lactate.\n        *   **Chirality:** We look for a chiral center. The second carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.

It occurs when a molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common test for chirality is the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Molecules that exhibit optical isomerism are called optically active.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze each compound for chirality.**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n        *   This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond.\n        *   The positions ortho to the single bond (positions 2, 2', 6, 6') are substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃).\n        *   These bulky groups cause significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them.\n        *   This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a specific, non-planar conformation.\n        *   Because the substitution pattern is not symmetric with respect to a plane bisecting the molecule (e.g., the groups at 2 and 6 are different from those at 2' and 6'), the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n        *   This type of chirality, arising from restricted rotation about a single bond, is called **atropisomerism**. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n        *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate)**:\n        *   The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n        *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n            2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n            4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter).\n        *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n        *   Therefore, this compound exists as a pair of enantiomers and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    3.  **benzophenone**:\n        *   The chemical structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n        *   The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom, so it is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen). It cannot be a chiral center.\n        *   The molecule is not planar, but the two phenyl rings can rotate. In any stable conformation, the molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry passing through the C=O bond. More importantly, it is possible to find a conformation that has a plane of symmetry which contains the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n        *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry is **achiral** and cannot be optically active. Its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule.\n        *   Therefore, this compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n        *   The chemical structure is the *trans* isomer of CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n        *   The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond.\n        *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore **achiral**.\n        *   This molecule also has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n        *   Molecules with a center of inversion are always achiral. (This compound exhibits geometric isomerism with its *cis* counterpart, dimethyl maleate, but not optical isomerism).\n        *   Therefore, this compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclude based on the analysis.**\n    *   Compound 1 shows optical isomerism (due to atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2 shows optical isomerism (due to a chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3 is achiral.\n    *   Compound 4 is achiral.\n    *   Thus, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere's a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism.\n\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A molecule is chiral if it lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Common causes of chirality include the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in some substituted biphenyls).\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond. The ortho positions (2, 6, 2', and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃) at positions 2 and 2', and nitro groups (-NO₂) at positions 6 and 6'.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** In biphenyls, if the ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups, free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is restricted. This phenomenon is called hindered rotation. If the substitution pattern also removes all planes of symmetry, the molecule becomes chiral. This specific type of chirality is known as **atropisomerism** (a form of axial chirality).\n    *   In this molecule, the four large substituents prevent the rings from becoming coplanar. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's focus on the second carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. We check the four groups attached to this carbon:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center**. Molecules containing a single chiral center are always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized as it is part of a double bond. It is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl rings), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the O=C bond angle and the angle between the two C-phenyl bonds.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond (a *trans* configuration).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar because of the carbon-carbon double bond. It possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C double bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** As the molecule has elements of symmetry, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Achiral.\n*   Compound 4: Achiral.\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups). Another source of chirality is axial chirality, which arises from restricted rotation around a single bond, as seen in some substituted biphenyls (a phenomenon known as atropisomerism). A molecule is achiral (not chiral) if it possesses an element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond. The positions ortho to this bond (2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: nitro groups (-NO2) and methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The large size of these ortho substituents creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation forces the rings into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation and its mirror image are non-superimposable. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. This is a classic example of atropisomerism, a type of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group. This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since C2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the C=O bond. There are no chiral centers. The molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid.

A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. Biphenyls consist of two phenyl rings joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Atropisomerism:** Normally, there is free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings. However, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), this rotation can be restricted. This restricted rotation can lead to a type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism, which results in axial chirality.\n    *   **Substituents:** In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These groups are bulky enough to prevent the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar.\n    *   **Chirality:** Because the rings are forced into a stable, twisted conformation, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. It is not superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure Analysis:** This molecule is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** To check for chirality, we look for a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   **Groups Attached:** This carbon atom is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   **Chirality:** Since the carbon at position 2 is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. Any molecule with a single chiral center is chiral. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers (mirror images) and shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure Analysis:** The structure is (C6H5)2C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality:** A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral, meaning it is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure Analysis:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with a *trans* configuration about the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Furthermore, it possesses a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** Due to the presence of both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, dimethyl fumarate is achiral. It does not show optical isomerism.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or the presence of axial chirality (as seen in some substituted biphenyls, called atropisomers).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond.\n    *   **Substitution:** Each phenyl ring has a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃) at an *ortho* position (positions 2 and 2') and a nitro group (-NO₂) at the other *ortho* position (positions 6 and 6').\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The groups at the *ortho* positions (-COOCH₃ and -NO₂) are bulky. Their size creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation forces the two rings to be non-coplanar. Because each ring is asymmetrically substituted (with respect to the bond connecting the rings), the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. This type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation about a single bond, is called **atropisomerism** (a form of axial chirality). The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable enantiomers. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is an ester derived from lactic acid.

Furthermore, the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Any molecule that has a plane of symmetry is **achiral** and cannot be optically active. Its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is *trans*-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule itself is a plane of symmetry. It also has a center of inversion.

A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features that lead to chirality are:\n1.  **Chiral Center (Asymmetric Carbon):** A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Axial Chirality (Atropisomerism):** Chirality arising from restricted rotation around a single bond, typically seen in substituted biphenyl compounds.\n3.  **Absence of Symmetry Elements:** Chiral molecules lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The key to chirality in biphenyls is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the rings. This restriction, known as atropisomerism, occurs when there are bulky substituents at the *ortho* positions (the positions next to the connecting bond: 2, 6, 2', and 6').\n*   In this molecule, all four *ortho* positions are substituted:\n    *   Positions 2 and 2' have bulky methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   Positions 6 and 6' have bulky nitro groups (-NO₂).\n*   These large groups physically block the free rotation around the central C-C bond. This forces the two phenyl rings to be in different planes (non-coplanar). The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl lactate)**\n*   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n*   **Analysis:** We need to check for chiral centers. Let's look at the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n*   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and thus it exhibits optical isomerism. It exists as two enantiomers (R- and S-methyl lactate).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of two phenyl rings attached to a central carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (two phenyl rings, one oxygen). It cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric. It has a plane of symmetry that runs through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. It is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is *trans*-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. There are no chiral centers. The molecule has both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C double bond).\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. It does not exhibit optical isomerism. It does, however, have a geometric isomer (dimethyl maleate, the *cis*-isomer), but neither is optically active.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Molecule 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Molecule 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Molecule 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Molecule 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the correct compounds are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**1.

The structure consists of two phenyl rings linked by a carbon-carbon single bond. There are substituents at the positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). Specifically, two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) are at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) are at positions 6 and 6'.\n*   **Source of Chirality (Atropisomerism):** In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6'), they can sterically hinder the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation can lock the molecule into a non-planar, twisted conformation.\n*   **Chirality Check:** For this specific molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups (-NO2 and -COOCH3). This severely restricts rotation. The resulting twisted conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which is a type of axial chirality. Therefore, this compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**2.

The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.

A simple way to check for this is to look for elements of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry. The benzophenone molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.

The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (or chiral center), which is an atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups. However, chirality can also arise from other structural features, such as a chiral axis (atropisomerism) or a chiral plane. A simple way to check for chirality is to look for elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).

Understand Optical Isomerism:**\nOptical isomerism occurs when a molecule is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are:\n*   **Chiral center (or stereocenter):** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Axial chirality:** Found in molecules that have a chiral axis due to restricted rotation around a bond. Common examples are substituted biphenyls (atropisomers), allenes, and spiranes.\n*   **Planar chirality:** Found in molecules where a plane is chiral.\n*   A key test for achirality is the presence of an internal plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i). If a molecule has either of these symmetry elements, it is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Compound:**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system. Two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   The positions ortho to this central bond (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) at 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) at 6 and 6'.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The bulky substituents at all four ortho positions sterically hinder the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This lack of free rotation is a prerequisite for a type of axial chirality known as atropisomerism. To be chiral, the molecule must not be superimposable on its mirror image. We check for planes of symmetry.\n    *   Consider one of the rings. It has a -COOCH3 group at position 2 and a -NO2 group at position 6. Since these two substituents are different, the ring itself is not symmetric with respect to the axis of the biphenyl bond. The same applies to the second ring.\n    *   Because of the restricted rotation and the lack of symmetry within each ring, the molecule as a whole lacks an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image will be a non-superimposable enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality (atropisomerism).\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid).

The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar and highly symmetrical. It has a center of inversion (a center of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. If you draw a line from any atom through this point, you will find an identical atom at an equal distance on the opposite side. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.

This typically occurs when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each of the given compounds to determine if they are chiral.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This molecule belongs to a class of compounds called biphenyls. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single carbon-carbon bond.\n    *   The molecule has bulky substituents at all four ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). The substituents are nitro groups (-NO₂) at the 6 and 6' positions, and ester groups (-COOCH₃) at the 2 and 2' positions.\n    *   These bulky groups create significant steric hindrance, which restricts the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n    *   This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, locks the molecule into a conformation where the two phenyl rings are not in the same plane (non-coplanar).\n    *   This fixed, non-planar structure lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   Consequently, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   This is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   To check for chirality, we look for chiral centers (stereocenters). A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        2.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The molecule is not chiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the carbon and oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Since it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar.

Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe user wants to identify which of the given organic compounds can exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Optical Isomerism**\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecule is **chiral**. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The two non-superimposable mirror images are called enantiomers. A key test for chirality is the absence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion in the molecule's conformation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each compound for chirality.**\n\n**Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   At the 2 and 2' positions are dimethyl dicarboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   At the 6 and 6' positions are nitro groups (-NO2).\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The positions ortho to the inter-ring C-C bond (positions 2, 2', 6, 6') are occupied by bulky groups (-COOCH3 and -NO2). These bulky groups sterically hinder the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**. Because rotation is restricted, the two phenyl rings are forced into a non-planar (twisted) arrangement.\n*   **Symmetry Check:**\n    *   Does this twisted molecule have a plane of symmetry? No. A plane cannot bisect the molecule into two identical halves because of the twist and the specific placement of different substituents.\n    *   Does it have a center of inversion? No.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion due to hindered rotation, it is chiral. Its mirror image will be non-superimposable. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl Lactate)**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's focus on the central carbon atom, which is C2 (the carbon bearing the -OH group). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n*   A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is called a **chiral center** or a stereocenter.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule inherently chiral (unless it is a meso compound, which requires at least two chiral centers). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers (R-methyl lactate and S-methyl lactate) and shows optical isomerism.\n\n**Compound 3: benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The formula is (C6H5)2CO or Ph-CO-Ph. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is not planar, as the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the C=O group. However, we must check for symmetry elements.\n    *   **Symmetry Check:** The molecule possesses a C2 axis of rotation that passes through the C=O bond. More importantly, it has a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is **achiral**. Its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two -COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has at least one plane of symmetry: the molecular plane itself.\n    *   **Symmetry Check:** Besides the molecular plane, dimethyl fumarate also has a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Inverting any atom through this point results in an identical atom.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, the molecule is **achiral** and cannot show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Consolidate the results.**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral due to atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral due to a stereocenter).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral, has a plane of symmetry).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral, has a plane of symmetry and center of inversion).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n**Step 4: Select the correct option.**\nThe option that includes both 1 and 2 is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is considered chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable on the original molecule. The most common features that lead to chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in certain atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    1.  **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl.

The positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n    2.  **Chirality Check:** The presence of these large groups at the ortho positions causes significant steric hindrance, which prevents free rotation about the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation is a condition for a specific type of stereoisomerism known as atropisomerism.\n    3.  **Symmetry Check:** Because the rotation is locked, the two phenyl rings are held in a twisted, non-planar conformation. This molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable.\n    4.  **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to axial chirality (atropisomerism) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    1.  **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate.\n    2.  **Chirality Check:** We need to examine the carbon atoms for chiral centers. Let's look at the carbon at position 2 (the one attached to the hydroxyl group).\n    3.  **Groups Attached to C2:** This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n        *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        *   a methyl group (-CH3)\n        *   a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    4.  **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze benzophenone**\n    1.  **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    2.  **Chirality Check:** There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The central carbon is sp2-hybridized, bonded to only three groups.\n    3.  **Symmetry Check:** Although the two phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group, the molecule as a whole possesses a C2 axis of rotation that passes through the C=O bond. More importantly, it is possible to find a plane of symmetry. A plane passing through the C=O group and bisecting the angle between the two phenyl groups acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    4.  **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes benzophenone an achiral molecule. Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze dimethyl fumarate**\n    1.  **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid.

All the atoms lie in the same plane.\n    3.  **Symmetry Check:** Any planar molecule has the plane of the molecule itself as a plane of symmetry. Additionally, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    4.  **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **Final Summary:**\n    *   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.

The most common features that lead to chirality are:\n*   **A chiral center (or stereocenter):** Typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Axial chirality:** Found in molecules that lack a chiral center but have an axis of chirality, such as certain allenes, spiranes, and atropisomers (like hindered biphenyls).\n*   **Planar chirality:** Found in molecules like certain cyclophanes.\n\nA molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is **achiral** and will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**2. Analyzing Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are linked by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** The positions ortho to the bond connecting the rings (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with large, bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n    *   These bulky groups prevent the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. This restricted rotation forces the rings into a fixed, non-planar arrangement.\n    *   In this twisted conformation, the molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, which is a type of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is also known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine carbon-2 (the carbon atom bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since carbon-2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and thus it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2CO. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbonyl carbon is only bonded to three atoms (one oxygen and two carbons) and cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate: CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It has a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond. It also has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary**\n*   Compound 1: Chiral (atropisomerism) -> Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 2: Chiral (chiral center) -> Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 3: Achiral (plane of symmetry) -> Does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4: Achiral (center of inversion) -> Does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where molecules have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. Such molecules are called enantiomers. A key condition for a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism is that it must be **chiral**, meaning it lacks an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound for chirality.\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single bond.\n    *   **Atropisomerism:** Free rotation around the single bond between the two phenyl rings is severely restricted by the presence of large, bulky groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality:** This restricted rotation (hindered rotation) leads to a stable, non-planar conformation. For such an atropisomer to be chiral, the molecule must not be superimposable on its mirror image. This is the case here because each ring is asymmetrically substituted (e.g., ring 1 has a -COOCH3 group at position 2 and a -NO2 group at position 6). The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Therefore, it is chiral and will exist as a pair of enantiomers. It exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. It is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** A carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups is called a chiral center or an asymmetric carbon atom. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   **Chirality:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center in a molecule makes it chiral (unless it's a meso compound, which is not applicable here). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **3. benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is (C6H5)2C=O. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is achiral. It has a plane of symmetry that contains the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Chirality:** Since benzophenone is achiral, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two -COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar. It possesses a center of inversion (also called a center of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Chirality:** Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    Based on the analysis, compounds **1** (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and **2** (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) are chiral and therefore show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D, which includes 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecules**\n\n    Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (due to restricted rotation about a single bond, as seen in some substituted biphenyls).\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond. The positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky groups: nitro (-NO₂) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₃). These bulky groups hinder the free rotation around the C-C single bond connecting the rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, forces the two rings to be in different planes. Because the substitution pattern on each ring is asymmetric, the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It is therefore chiral and will have a non-superimposable mirror image. Thus, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        Since this carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and thus exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. The central carbon is part of a carbonyl group (C=O), so it is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen atom). There are no chiral centers. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule through the C=O group. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* geometry about the carbon-carbon double bond. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar. It has a center of symmetry (inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    Based on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Benzophenone (3) and dimethyl fumarate (4) are achiral and do not.\n\n    Therefore, the correct combination is 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Fundamental Concept:**\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules.

The groups are nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3).\n*   **Rotation:** These large groups clash with each other, sterically hindering the free rotation around the single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n*   **Chirality:** Because of this restricted rotation, the rings are forced to be non-coplanar (twisted relative to each other). This twisted conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion because each ring is asymmetrically substituted. The mirror image of the molecule is therefore non-superimposable on the original molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule exhibits axial chirality and is optically active.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate.

A molecule possessing a plane of symmetry is always achiral.\n*   **Chirality:** Since it is achiral, it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the substituents are in a *trans* arrangement across the double bond.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar. The plane containing all the atoms acts as a plane of symmetry.

The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** Biphenyl compounds can exhibit a type of stereoisomerism called **atropisomerism**. This happens when rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is significantly restricted, usually by bulky substituents in the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n*   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6'.\n*   The steric hindrance from these large groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them.

This is often because it lacks any elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   The benzophenone molecule is not planar in its lowest energy state due to steric interactions between the phenyl rings, but the barrier to rotation around the C-C bonds is very low, allowing for rapid interconversion between twisted conformations at room temperature.\n*   More importantly, the molecule can easily adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry.

Reasoning and Analysis**\n\nTo determine if a compound shows optical isomerism, we need to assess if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality (like in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it possesses a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a special type of chirality called atropisomerism.\n    *   Atropisomerism arises when there is a significant energy barrier to rotation around a single bond. In this case, it's the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n    *   The bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6')—two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3)—provide strong steric hindrance.\n    *   This steric hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely and becoming coplanar.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (due to restricted rotation about a bond, as seen in atropisomers).

Certain substituted biphenyls can exhibit a form of chirality called **atropisomerism**. This occurs when the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is sterically hindered by bulky substituents in the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6'. This steric hindrance prevents free rotation around the biphenyl bond, locking the rings in a non-planar conformation.\n    *   For the molecule to be chiral, it must also lack a plane of symmetry. Each ring is substituted with two different groups (-COOCH3 and -NO2). Because of this asymmetric substitution and the locked conformation, the molecule as a whole lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). It exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   This compound is an ester, also known as methyl lactate.

Reasoning and Analysis of Each Compound:**\n\nTo determine if a compound shows optical isomerism, we need to check if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. It consists of two phenyl rings linked by a carbon-carbon single bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** Substituted biphenyls can exhibit a special type of chirality called atropisomerism (a form of axial chirality). This occurs when bulky groups on the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') of the phenyl rings restrict free rotation around the single bond that connects them.\n    *   **Analysis:** In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6', and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'. This steric hindrance prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar, locking the molecule into a twisted conformation.\n    *   Furthermore, for the molecule to be chiral, there must be no plane of symmetry. Since the substituents on each ring are different at the ortho positions (a -COOCH3 group at C2 and a -NO2 group at C6), the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The restricted rotation and the lack of symmetry make the molecule chiral. It exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.

A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since all four groups attached to the second carbon atom are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and exists as two enantiomers, (R)- and (S)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Thus, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** Benzophenone has the formula (C₆H₅)₂CO.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. However, other structural features can also lead to chirality, such as axial chirality, which is observed in certain substituted biphenyls (atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (not optically active) if it possesses an element of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Step-by-step analysis of each compound:**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule is a biphenyl derivative. A biphenyl consists of two phenyl rings connected by a C-C single bond. The substituents are located at positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'. These are the \"ortho\" positions relative to the bond connecting the two rings.\n        *   The substituents are two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃). These groups are quite large and create significant steric hindrance.\n        *   **Atropisomerism:** Due to the steric hindrance from these bulky ortho groups, the free rotation around the C-C single bond between the two phenyl rings is prevented. This forces the rings to adopt a twisted, non-planar conformation. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n        *   **Chirality:** To determine if the molecule is chiral, we check for elements of symmetry in its stable, twisted conformation. The substitution pattern is asymmetric on each ring (a -NO₂ and a -COOCH₃ group). The overall molecule lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral due to axial chirality (atropisomerism) and thus exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. It is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n        *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n    3.  **benzophenone:**\n        *   **Structure:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A central carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n        *   **Chirality:** The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. The central carbon is sp² hybridized. We must check for molecular symmetry. Although the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group, the molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond. More importantly, its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule. It is achiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule is superimposable on its mirror image because the plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, it possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Final Decision:**\n    *   Compound 1 is optically active.\n    *   Compound 2 is optically active.\n    *   Compound 3 is not optically active.\n    *   Compound 4 is not optically active.\n\n    Therefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.

This property often arises from the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or other elements of chirality like axial, planar, or helical chirality. Molecules that are chiral are optically active. Molecules that have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond. Each ring is substituted at positions 2 and 6. One ring has a methyl ester (-COOCH3) at position 2 and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 6. The other ring has the same substituents at the corresponding 2' and 6' positions.\n    *   **Chirality:** In biphenyl systems, if the substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are large enough, they can prevent free rotation around the single bond that connects the two rings. This restricted rotation is called atropisomerism. In this specific molecule, the methyl ester (-COOCH3) and nitro (-NO2) groups are bulky. This steric hindrance locks the molecule into a conformation where the two rings are not in the same plane (non-coplanar). The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. As a result, its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This molecule exhibits axial chirality due to atropisomerism and is therefore optically active. It shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** Also known as methyl lactate, its formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2.

The compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (also known as methyl lactate):**\n        *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n        *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (the 2nd carbon in the propanoate chain).\n            *   It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n            *   It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3).\n            *   It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n            *   It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3).\n        *   Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinctly different groups, it is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter).\n        *   Molecules containing a single chiral center are always chiral and will exist as a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Thus, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    3.  **benzophenone:**\n        *   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. A central carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n        *   **Chirality:** The central carbon atom is sp2 hybridized (it has a double bond to oxygen), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule possesses symmetry. Specifically, it has a C2 rotational axis that passes through the C=O bond. Its mirror image is identical to and superimposable on the original molecule.\n        *   Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups in a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond.\n        *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. It contains a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n        *   Although it has a stereoisomer (dimethyl maleate, the *cis* isomer), this is an example of geometric (cis-trans) isomerism, not optical isomerism. Both dimethyl fumarate and dimethyl maleate are achiral.\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are chiral and show optical isomerism. Benzophenone (3) and dimethyl fumarate (4) are achiral and do not.\n\n    Therefore, the correct option includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n**Detailed analysis:**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. Chirality typically arises from the absence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl system. Biphenyls consist of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In this molecule, all four positions *ortho* to the connecting single bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with bulky groups (nitro -NO₂ and dimethyl carboxylate -COOCH₃).\n    *   **Chirality:** The bulky groups at the ortho positions prevent the two phenyl rings from becoming co-planar due to steric hindrance. This locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. Because of the substitution pattern, this twisted conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The molecule is therefore chiral, and its mirror image is non-superimposable. This type of stereoisomerism arising from hindered rotation is called **atropisomerism**. Thus, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure:** The structure can be written as CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** We need to look for chiral centers. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n        2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        4.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule as a whole chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. It consists of a carbonyl group attached to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality:** This molecule is symmetric. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. It is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of the dimethyl ester of butenedioic acid (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃). The two ester groups (-COOCH₃) are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. It possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral and not optically active.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Compound **1** is optically active due to atropisomerism.\n*   Compound **2** is optically active due to a chiral center.\n*   Compound **3** is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.\n*   Compound **4** is achiral due to a center of inversion and being planar.\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nAn organic moiety shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in atropisomers). Let's analyze each of the given compounds.\n\n### 1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl compound, which consists of two benzene rings linked by a single carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The key to chirality in biphenyls is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings. This restricted rotation occurs when there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this molecule:\n    *   The substituents at positions 2 and 2' are methylcarboxylate groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   The substituents at positions 6 and 6' are nitro groups (-NO₂).\n    *   Both of these groups are bulky enough to sterically hinder free rotation around the central C-C bond. This forces the two phenyl rings into a stable, non-planar conformation.\n    *   This locked, non-planar structure lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**, a form of axial chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n### 2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\n*   **Structure:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** We look for chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine carbon-2 (the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group):\n    *   It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four attached groups are different, carbon-2 is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism and exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S isomers).\n\n### 3. benzophenone\n\n*   **Structure:** This compound has the formula (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl groups), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. Specifically, it has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and reflects one phenyl group onto the other. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n### 4. dimethyl fumarate\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-ene-1,4-dioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. A planar molecule always has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself). Furthermore, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements (a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion) means the molecule is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

    "**Detailed Reasoning Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruction of the Question:** The question asks to identify which of the four given organic compounds will show optical isomerism. A compound shows optical isomerism if its molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key features to look for are a lack of symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The most common causes of chirality are the presence of a chiral center (e.g., a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (e.g., in substituted biphenyls, known as atropisomers).\n\n2.  **Analysis of Each Compound:**\n    *   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky substituents (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups). This creates significant steric hindrance, which restricts rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism. The molecule is forced into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation. Since the substitution on each ring is asymmetric (a -COOCH3 group at one ortho position and a -NO2 at the other), the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is therefore chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. The vast majority of the provided candidate answers correctly identify this.\n\n    *   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. To check for chirality, we look for a chiral center. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different groups: (1) a hydrogen atom (-H), (2) a hydroxyl group (-OH), (3) a methyl group (-CH₃), and (4) a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since it is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism. This conclusion is universally agreed upon in all candidate answers.\n\n    *   **3. benzophenone:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon is sp² hybridized, so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule is symmetric; it possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings and passes through the C=O bond. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. It will not show optical isomerism. All candidate answers correctly identify this molecule as achiral.\n\n    *   **4. dimethyl fumarate:** This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃). The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), making it achiral. Additionally, it possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. It will not show optical isomerism. This conclusion is also universally agreed upon in all candidate answers.\n\n3.  **Synthesis of the Most Consistent Answer:**\n    The analysis consistently shows that compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not. Therefore, the correct answer should be the option that includes \"1 and 2\". Looking at the multiple-choice options provided, option B corresponds to \"1 and 2\".\n\n    While nearly every candidate answer provides a correct and consistent reasoning process, there is a wide variation in the final letter choice (`<<<X>>>`). Many answers present flawless reasoning that points to \"1 and 2\" as the solution but then illogically conclude with A, C, or D. The most consistent answer is one where the logical reasoning is directly reflected in the final choice. The set of answers that conclude with `<<<B>>>` are the only ones where the reasoning and the final answer are in complete alignment.

Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in the molecule's stable conformation.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Substituents:** The positions ortho to the inter-ring bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted.\n        *   At positions 2 and 2', there are dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n        *   At positions 6 and 6', there are nitro groups (-NO2).\n    *   **Chirality Check:** In biphenyls, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions, they can clash with each other, preventing free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings. This restricted rotation is called \"atropisomerism\".\n    *   The nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups are sufficiently bulky to hinder rotation. This locks the two phenyl rings in a non-planar (twisted) conformation.\n    *   Next, we check for symmetry. In this twisted conformation, there is no plane of symmetry that can cut the molecule into two identical halves, nor is there a center of inversion.\n    *   Because the molecule is non-planar and lacks these symmetry elements, it is chiral. Chiral molecules can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and thus exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 1 shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** Let's break down the name. \"Propanoate\" indicates a 3-carbon chain with a carboxylate group. \"Methyl\" means it's an ester with a methyl group (CH3O-). \"2-hydroxy\" means an -OH group is on carbon-2. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This compound is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** We look for a chiral center. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine Carbon-2 (the one with the -OH group):\n        1.  It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        2.  It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3).\n        3.  It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3).\n        4.  It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n    *   Since Carbon-2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 2 shows optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Analyze Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It's a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Chirality Check:**\n        *   There is no carbon atom with four different single-bonded substituents, so there is no chiral center.\n        *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry. A plane can be imagined passing through the C=O bond and bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 3 does not show optical isomerism.\n\n5.  **Analyze Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** Fumarate is the trans-isomer of butenedioate. Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups (-COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Check:**\n        *   There are no chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule itself is a plane of symmetry. It also possesses a center of inversion (a point in the middle of the C=C bond).\n    *   The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 4 does not show optical isomerism.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound 1 is optically active (due to atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2 is optically active (due to a chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3 is not optically active (achiral).\n    *   Compound 4 is not optically active (achiral).\n\n    Therefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism:**\n    Optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism where a molecule is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack any improper axis of rotation (S_n), which includes planes of symmetry (S_1) and centers of inversion (S_2). The most common features leading to chirality are:\n    1.  **Chiral Center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n    2.  **Axial Chirality:** Chirality arising from restricted rotation around a single bond, as seen in some substituted biphenyls (atropisomers), allenes, and spiranes.\n    3.  **Planar Chirality:** Chirality arising from a plane in the molecule, as seen in compounds like ansa compounds or trans-cyclooctene.\n\n*   **Evaluation of each compound:**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   This is a biphenyl compound substituted at all four ortho-positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6').\n        *   The substituents are nitro groups (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These are bulky groups.\n        *   The steric hindrance caused by these bulky ortho-substituents prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism.\n        *   Because rotation is restricted, the molecule is locked into a specific conformation. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n        *   As a result, it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This is a classic example of axial chirality.\n        *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group, -OH).\n        *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n        *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n        *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism (existing as R- and S-enantiomers).\n\n    3.  **benzophenone:**\n        *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A central carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n        *   The molecule does not have a chiral center. The central carbon is sp² hybridized.\n        *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. It has a C₂ rotational axis passing through the C=O bond. Even in its twisted, low-energy conformation, its mirror image is superimposable upon the original molecule.\n        *   Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid).\n        *   Its structure is trans-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n        *   The molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n        *   Additionally, the molecule has a center of inversion (or center of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n        *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, compounds 1 (due to axial chirality/atropisomerism) and 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral.\n\nThus, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The user wants to identify which of the four given organic compounds can exhibit optical isomerism.\n2.  **Define Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups), but other sources exist, such as axial chirality (atropisomerism). A key test for chirality is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. If a molecule has either of these symmetry elements, it is **achiral** and will not be optically active.\n\n3.  **Analyze each compound:**\n\n    *   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n        *   **Key Feature:** The positions ortho to the linking bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** These large groups cause significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This restricted rotation forces the rings to be non-coplanar. The resulting twisted conformation lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. This type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation about a single bond, is called **atropisomerism**. Since the molecule is chiral, it will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n        *   **Key Feature:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2, which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter). The presence of a single chiral center in a molecule makes it chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism (existing as R and S enantiomers).\n\n    *   **3. benzophenone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a ketone with the formula (C6H5)2CO or Ph-C(=O)-Ph.\n        *   **Key Feature:** The central carbon is part of a carbonyl group (C=O), so it's sp2 hybridized and bonded to only three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen). It cannot be a chiral center.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry**. Imagine a plane cutting through the C=O bond and bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings. The left half of the molecule is a mirror image of the right half. Because it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **4. dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is trans-CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.\n        *   **Key Feature:** It is a planar molecule due to the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. It also has a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself). The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.

In biphenyl systems, if the four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky substituents, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is hindered due to steric strain.\n    *   **Analysis:** In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6', and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'. This steric hindrance prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar. The molecule is forced into a stable, twisted conformation. This molecule lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. As a result, it is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or the presence of an element of axial or planar chirality.

In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, can lead to chirality if the molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry.\n        *   **Symmetry:** The substitution pattern on each ring is asymmetric (a -COOCH3 group at position 2 and a -NO2 group at position 6). Due to the restricted rotation and the lack of symmetry, the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The molecule possesses axial chirality and is therefore optically active.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is an ester with the formula CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups). Another source of chirality is axial chirality, which arises from restricted rotation around a single bond, as seen in some substituted biphenyls (a phenomenon known as atropisomerism).

Biphenyls consist of two phenyl rings joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Atropisomerism:** Normally, there is free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings. However, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), this rotation can be restricted. This restricted rotation can lead to a type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism, which results in axial chirality.\n    *   **Substituents:** In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These groups are bulky enough to prevent the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar.\n    *   **Chirality:** Because the rings are forced into a stable, twisted conformation, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. It is not superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure Analysis:** This molecule is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** To check for chirality, we look for a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   **Groups Attached:** This carbon atom is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   **Chirality:** Since the carbon at position 2 is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. Any molecule with a single chiral center is chiral. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers (mirror images) and shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure Analysis:** The structure is (C6H5)2C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality:** A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral, meaning it is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure Analysis:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with a *trans* configuration about the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Furthermore, it possesses a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** Due to the presence of both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, dimethyl fumarate is achiral. It does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It is a stereoisomer of dimethyl maleate, which is the *cis* isomer, but neither compound is chiral).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** Yes (axial chirality)\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Yes (chiral center)\n*   **3. benzophenone:** No (achiral)\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate:** No (achiral)\n\nTherefore, the correct option includes both 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn organic compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning its molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from the presence of a chiral center or from specific structural constraints that lead to axial or planar chirality. A molecule is achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl compound. In biphenyls, if the four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are occupied by bulky groups, free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is hindered. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n    *   In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted by bulky nitro groups (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). This steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar, locking the molecule in a twisted conformation.\n    *   To be chiral, the molecule must not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Each ring is asymmetrically substituted (a -COOCH3 group at one ortho position and a -NO2 group at the other). This lack of symmetry in the substitution pattern of the rings ensures that the molecule as a whole is chiral. It is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism due to atropisomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This molecule is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   The central carbon atom (C2, the one attached to the -OH group) is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.

A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is a chiral center (or stereocenter). The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is (C6H5)2CO, which is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   The central carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and is bonded to only three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl groups), so it cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole possesses a C2 axis of rotation passing through the C=O bond. It also possesses a plane of symmetry that includes this axis. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Since it is achiral, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself), which makes it achiral. This molecule also possesses a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   Since it is achiral, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and therefore show optical isomerism.

It consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The central carbon atom is sp2-hybridized as it is part of a C=O double bond. It is bonded to only three groups (two carbons and one oxygen), so it cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   Although the two phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group due to steric hindrance, creating a \"propeller\" shape that is technically chiral in a fixed state, the energy barrier for rotation around the carbon-phenyl single bonds is very low.\n    *   This means that the two enantiomeric conformations interconvert rapidly at room temperature. Because the enantiomers cannot be isolated, the compound is considered effectively achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features that lead to chirality are:\n1.  **Chiral Center (Asymmetric Carbon):** A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Axial Chirality (Atropisomerism):** Chirality arising from restricted rotation around a single bond, typically seen in substituted biphenyl compounds.\n3.  **Absence of Symmetry Elements:** Chiral molecules lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The key to chirality in biphenyls is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the rings. This restriction, known as atropisomerism, occurs when there are bulky substituents at the *ortho* positions (the positions next to the connecting bond: 2, 6, 2', and 6').\n*   In this molecule, all four *ortho* positions are substituted:\n    *   Positions 2 and 2' have bulky methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   Positions 6 and 6' have bulky nitro groups (-NO₂).\n*   These large groups physically block the free rotation around the central C-C bond. This forces the two phenyl rings to be in different planes (non-coplanar). The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl lactate)**\n*   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n*   **Analysis:** We need to check for chiral centers. Let's look at the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n*   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and thus it exhibits optical isomerism. It exists as two enantiomers (R- and S-methyl lactate).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of two phenyl rings attached to a central carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (two phenyl rings, one oxygen). It cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric. It has a plane of symmetry that runs through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. It is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is *trans*-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. There are no chiral centers. The molecule has both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C double bond).\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. It does not exhibit optical isomerism. It does, however, have a geometric isomer (dimethyl maleate, the *cis*-isomer), but neither is optically active.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Molecule 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Molecule 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Molecule 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Molecule 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the correct compounds are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**1. Analysis of dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The structure consists of two phenyl rings linked by a carbon-carbon single bond. There are substituents at the positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). Specifically, two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) are at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) are at positions 6 and 6'.\n*   **Source of Chirality (Atropisomerism):** In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6'), they can sterically hinder the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation can lock the molecule into a non-planar, twisted conformation.\n*   **Chirality Check:** For this specific molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups (-NO2 and -COOCH3). This severely restricts rotation. The resulting twisted conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which is a type of axial chirality. Therefore, this compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**2.

The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n*   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active.

Its structure is (C6H5)2C=O, where a central carbonyl group is attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Check:** To be optically active, a molecule must be chiral (not superimposable on its mirror image). A simple way to check for this is to look for elements of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry. The benzophenone molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, benzophenone is not optically active.\n\n**4. Analysis of dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid.

Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe user wants to identify which of the given molecules exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concept of optical isomerism.**\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (or chiral center), which is an atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups. However, chirality can also arise from other structural features, such as a chiral axis (atropisomerism) or a chiral plane. A simple way to check for chirality is to look for elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i). If a molecule possesses either of these, it is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each molecule for chirality.**\n\n*   **Molecule 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative.

This restricted rotation forces the two phenyl rings into planes that are perpendicular to each other.\n    *   In this twisted conformation, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral. This specific type of chirality due to hindered rotation is called **atropisomerism**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is chiral, it will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Molecule 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is the one bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. We can identify the four groups attached to it:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH3 (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH3 (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinctly different groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral and therefore optically active.

This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry (σ). Additionally, there is a center of inversion (i) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Consolidate the results.**\n*   Molecule 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Molecule 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Molecule 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Molecule 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only molecules 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.

Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe user wants to identify which of the given organic compounds can exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Optical Isomerism**\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecule is **chiral**. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The two non-superimposable mirror images are called enantiomers. A key test for chirality is the absence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion in the molecule's conformation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each compound for chirality.**\n\n**Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   At the 2 and 2' positions are dimethyl dicarboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   At the 6 and 6' positions are nitro groups (-NO2).\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The positions ortho to the inter-ring C-C bond (positions 2, 2', 6, 6') are occupied by bulky groups (-COOCH3 and -NO2). These bulky groups sterically hinder the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**. Because rotation is restricted, the two phenyl rings are forced into a non-planar (twisted) arrangement.\n*   **Symmetry Check:**\n    *   Does this twisted molecule have a plane of symmetry? No. A plane cannot bisect the molecule into two identical halves because of the twist and the specific placement of different substituents.\n    *   Does it have a center of inversion? No.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion due to hindered rotation, it is chiral. Its mirror image will be non-superimposable. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl Lactate)**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's focus on the central carbon atom, which is C2 (the carbon bearing the -OH group). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n*   A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is called a **chiral center** or a stereocenter.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule inherently chiral (unless it is a meso compound, which requires at least two chiral centers). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers (R-methyl lactate and S-methyl lactate) and shows optical isomerism.\n\n**Compound 3: benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The formula is (C6H5)2CO or Ph-CO-Ph. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is not planar, as the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the C=O group. However, we must check for symmetry elements.\n    *   **Symmetry Check:** The molecule possesses a C2 axis of rotation that passes through the C=O bond. More importantly, it has a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is **achiral**. Its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two -COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has at least one plane of symmetry: the molecular plane itself.\n    *   **Symmetry Check:** Besides the molecular plane, dimethyl fumarate also has a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Inverting any atom through this point results in an identical atom.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, the molecule is **achiral** and cannot show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Consolidate the results.**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral due to atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral due to a stereocenter).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral, has a plane of symmetry).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral, has a plane of symmetry and center of inversion).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n**Step 4: Select the correct option.**\nThe option that includes both 1 and 2 is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is considered chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable on the original molecule. The most common features that lead to chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in certain atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    1.  **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are linked by a single C-C bond. The positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n    2.  **Chirality Check:** The presence of these large groups at the ortho positions causes significant steric hindrance, which prevents free rotation about the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation is a condition for a specific type of stereoisomerism known as atropisomerism.\n    3.  **Symmetry Check:** Because the rotation is locked, the two phenyl rings are held in a twisted, non-planar conformation. This molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable.\n    4.  **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to axial chirality (atropisomerism) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    1.  **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate.\n    2.  **Chirality Check:** We need to examine the carbon atoms for chiral centers. Let's look at the carbon at position 2 (the one attached to the hydroxyl group).\n    3.  **Groups Attached to C2:** This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n        *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        *   a methyl group (-CH3)\n        *   a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    4.  **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze benzophenone**\n    1.  **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    2.  **Chirality Check:** There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The central carbon is sp2-hybridized, bonded to only three groups.\n    3.  **Symmetry Check:** Although the two phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group, the molecule as a whole possesses a C2 axis of rotation that passes through the C=O bond. More importantly, it is possible to find a plane of symmetry. A plane passing through the C=O group and bisecting the angle between the two phenyl groups acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    4.  **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes benzophenone an achiral molecule. Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze dimethyl fumarate**\n    1.  **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    2.  **Chirality Check:** This molecule is planar. All the atoms lie in the same plane.\n    3.  **Symmetry Check:** Any planar molecule has the plane of the molecule itself as a plane of symmetry. Additionally, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    4.  **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **Final Summary:**\n    *   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.

Such molecules are called enantiomers. A key condition for a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism is that it must be **chiral**, meaning it lacks an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound for chirality.\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single bond.\n    *   **Atropisomerism:** Free rotation around the single bond between the two phenyl rings is severely restricted by the presence of large, bulky groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality:** This restricted rotation (hindered rotation) leads to a stable, non-planar conformation. For such an atropisomer to be chiral, the molecule must not be superimposable on its mirror image. This is the case here because each ring is asymmetrically substituted (e.g., ring 1 has a -COOCH3 group at position 2 and a -NO2 group at position 6). The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Therefore, it is chiral and will exist as a pair of enantiomers. It exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond. The positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky groups: nitro (-NO₂) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₃). These bulky groups hinder the free rotation around the C-C single bond connecting the rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, forces the two rings to be in different planes. Because the substitution pattern on each ring is asymmetric, the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It is therefore chiral and will have a non-superimposable mirror image. Thus, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

The two phenyl rings are connected by a carbon-carbon single bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky substituents at the positions ortho to the bond connecting the rings (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), free rotation around the C-C single bond is restricted. In this specific molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6'.\n    *   This steric hindrance forces the two rings into a non-planar conformation. Due to the substitution pattern, this non-planar molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. A molecule that is non-superimposable on its mirror image due to hindered rotation is called an atropisomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is an ester derived from lactic acid, with the structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. It is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon atom is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is a chiral center (or stereocenter). The presence of a single chiral center in a molecule makes it chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound contains a chiral center, is therefore a chiral molecule, and exhibits optical isomerism. It exists as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a ketone with the formula (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is not planar, as the phenyl rings are twisted relative to the C=O plane. However, the molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the carbon and oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group. A molecule with an axis of rotation is not necessarily achiral, but benzophenone's symmetry makes it superimposable on its mirror image. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is trans-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). This molecule also possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond. The presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the correct options are compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nThis question asks us to identify which of the given compounds can exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are molecules that are non-superimposable on their mirror images. Let's analyze each compound for chirality.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** Biphenyl compounds can exhibit a type of stereoisomerism called **atropisomerism**. This happens when rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is significantly restricted, usually by bulky substituents in the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n*   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6'.\n*   The steric hindrance from these large groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. This locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   This fixed, non-planar conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. As a result, its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule has the chemical formula CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. It is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to look for a chiral center. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one attached to the -OH group):\n    1.  It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n    2.  It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    3.  It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    4.  It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n*   Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n*   **Conclusion:** Molecules containing a single chiral center are always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S isomers).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule has the chemical formula (C₆H₅)₂CO. It consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** To be chiral, a molecule must not be superimposable on its mirror image. This is often because it lacks any elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   The benzophenone molecule is not planar in its lowest energy state due to steric interactions between the phenyl rings, but the barrier to rotation around the C-C bonds is very low, allowing for rapid interconversion between twisted conformations at room temperature.\n*   More importantly, the molecule can easily adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would pass through the C=O bond and bisect the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and therefore does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is H₃COOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule is planar. Let's check for elements of symmetry.\n*   It has a **plane of symmetry**, which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   It also has a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. If you start at any atom, go to the center, and continue the same distance in the opposite direction, you will find an identical atom.\n*   A molecule with a center of inversion is always achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. It is a geometric isomer (stereoisomer), but not an optical isomer.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Chiral (atropisomerism)\n*   Compound 2: Chiral (chiral center)\n*   Compound 3: Achiral (has a plane of symmetry)\n*   Compound 4: Achiral (has a center of inversion)\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nAn optical isomer is a type of stereoisomer that is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Chirality Source:** This molecule is an example of atropisomerism, which gives rise to axial chirality. Rotation around the single bond between the two phenyl rings is severely restricted by the presence of large (bulky) substituent groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n*   **Analysis:** In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with nitro groups (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). Both of these groups are bulky enough to prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar through free rotation.\n*   **Symmetry:** For such a hindered biphenyl to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The substitution pattern here (nitro at 6, 6' and ester at 2, 2') results in a twisted structure that is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n*   **Chirality Source:** This molecule contains a potential stereocenter. A stereocenter (or chiral center) is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the hydroxyl group). It is bonded to:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is attached to four different groups, it is a stereocenter. A molecule with one stereocenter is always chiral (unless it's part of a meso compound, which is not the case here). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2CO.

The structure has a C=C double bond with a -COOCH3 group and a -H on each carbon, arranged in a *trans* configuration.\n*   **Chirality Source:** We check for stereocenters and overall molecular symmetry.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), which makes it achiral. Additionally, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.

Reasoning and Analysis**\n\nTo determine if a compound shows optical isomerism, we need to assess if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality (like in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it possesses a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a special type of chirality called atropisomerism.\n    *   Atropisomerism arises when there is a significant energy barrier to rotation around a single bond. In this case, it's the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n    *   The bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6')—two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3)—provide strong steric hindrance.\n    *   This steric hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely and becoming coplanar. The molecule is forced into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   Because of this fixed, twisted shape and the specific substitution pattern, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   Therefore, it is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   This is an ester, also known as methyl lactate.

The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Due to the C=C double bond, the molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has the plane of the molecule itself as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Additionally, this molecule possesses a center of inversion (a point at the center of the C=C bond through which an inversion operation results in an identical molecule).\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. However, other structural features can also lead to chirality, such as axial chirality, which is observed in certain substituted biphenyls (atropisomers).

A biphenyl consists of two phenyl rings connected by a C-C single bond. The substituents are located at positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'. These are the \"ortho\" positions relative to the bond connecting the two rings.\n        *   The substituents are two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃). These groups are quite large and create significant steric hindrance.\n        *   **Atropisomerism:** Due to the steric hindrance from these bulky ortho groups, the free rotation around the C-C single bond between the two phenyl rings is prevented. This forces the rings to adopt a twisted, non-planar conformation. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n        *   **Chirality:** To determine if the molecule is chiral, we check for elements of symmetry in its stable, twisted conformation. The substitution pattern is asymmetric on each ring (a -NO₂ and a -COOCH₃ group). The overall molecule lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral due to axial chirality (atropisomerism) and thus exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. It is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n        *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n    3.  **benzophenone:**\n        *   **Structure:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A central carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n        *   **Chirality:** The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. The central carbon is sp² hybridized. We must check for molecular symmetry. Although the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group, the molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond. More importantly, its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule. It is achiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule is superimposable on its mirror image because the plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, it possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Final Decision:**\n    *   Compound 1 is optically active.\n    *   Compound 2 is optically active.\n    *   Compound 3 is not optically active.\n    *   Compound 4 is not optically active.\n\n    Therefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where a molecule is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property often arises from the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or other elements of chirality like axial, planar, or helical chirality. Molecules that are chiral are optically active. Molecules that have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond. Each ring is substituted at positions 2 and 6. One ring has a methyl ester (-COOCH3) at position 2 and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 6. The other ring has the same substituents at the corresponding 2' and 6' positions.\n    *   **Chirality:** In biphenyl systems, if the substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are large enough, they can prevent free rotation around the single bond that connects the two rings. This restricted rotation is called atropisomerism. In this specific molecule, the methyl ester (-COOCH3) and nitro (-NO2) groups are bulky. This steric hindrance locks the molecule into a conformation where the two rings are not in the same plane (non-coplanar). The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. As a result, its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This molecule exhibits axial chirality due to atropisomerism and is therefore optically active. It shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** Also known as methyl lactate, its formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2. It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH3 (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH3 (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers ((R)- and (S)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate). Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The formula is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. It has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** The formula is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two methyl ester groups are in a *trans* arrangement across the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The entire molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, the molecule possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It does have a geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate, but that is a different type of isomerism).\n\n*   **Final Decision:**\n    Based on the analysis, compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n    Therefore, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism:**\n    A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The most common sources of chirality are:\n    1.  **Chiral center (asymmetric carbon):** A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    2.  **Axial chirality (atropisomerism):** Chirality arising from hindered rotation around a single bond, as seen in some substituted biphenyls.\n    3.  **Planar chirality:** Chirality arising from a plane that is part of a larger molecular structure.\n    4.  **Helicity:** Inherent chirality of a helix-shaped molecule.\n\n*   **Step-by-step analysis of the compounds:**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl compound.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable on the original molecule.

This hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. The rings are forced into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation.\n        *   Furthermore, each ring is asymmetrically substituted (one -COOCH3 and one -NO2 group on each).

Chirality typically arises from the absence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl system. Biphenyls consist of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In this molecule, all four positions *ortho* to the connecting single bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with bulky groups (nitro -NO₂ and dimethyl carboxylate -COOCH₃).\n    *   **Chirality:** The bulky groups at the ortho positions prevent the two phenyl rings from becoming co-planar due to steric hindrance. This locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. Because of the substitution pattern, this twisted conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The molecule is therefore chiral, and its mirror image is non-superimposable. This type of stereoisomerism arising from hindered rotation is called **atropisomerism**. Thus, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure:** The structure can be written as CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** We need to look for chiral centers.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in atropisomers). Let's analyze each of the given compounds.\n\n### 1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl compound, which consists of two benzene rings linked by a single carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The key to chirality in biphenyls is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings. This restricted rotation occurs when there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this molecule:\n    *   The substituents at positions 2 and 2' are methylcarboxylate groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   The substituents at positions 6 and 6' are nitro groups (-NO₂).\n    *   Both of these groups are bulky enough to sterically hinder free rotation around the central C-C bond. This forces the two phenyl rings into a stable, non-planar conformation.\n    *   This locked, non-planar structure lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**, a form of axial chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n### 2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\n*   **Structure:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** We look for chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine carbon-2 (the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group):\n    *   It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four attached groups are different, carbon-2 is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism and exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S isomers).\n\n### 3. benzophenone\n\n*   **Structure:** This compound has the formula (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl groups), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. Specifically, it has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and reflects one phenyl group onto the other. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n### 4. dimethyl fumarate\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-ene-1,4-dioic acid.
