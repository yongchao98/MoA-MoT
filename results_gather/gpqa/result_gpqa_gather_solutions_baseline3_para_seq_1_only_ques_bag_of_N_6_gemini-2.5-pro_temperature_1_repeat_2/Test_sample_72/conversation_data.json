Let's briefly review why this output is correct and leads to the final answer.\n\n### Verification of the Calculation\n\n**1. Relative Speed (`v_rel`)**\nThe formula for relativistic velocity subtraction is:\n`v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - v₁v₂/c²)`\nPlugging in the values `v₁ = 0.6c` and `v₂ = 0.5c`:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c`\nThe code output `0.14` (rounded) is correct.\n\n**2. Total Energy (`E`)**\nThe total energy is the sum of the individual relativistic energies `E = γmc²`, where `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n*   **Astronaut 1:**\n    *   `γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.6²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n    *   `E₁ = γ₁ * (2m) * c² = 1.25 * 2mc² = 2.5mc²`\n*   **Astronaut 2:**\n    *   `γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.5²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n    *   `E₂ = γ₂ * (3m) * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc² ≈ 3.464mc²`\n\n*   **Total Energy:**\n    *   `E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5mc² + 3.464mc² = 5.964mc²`\n\nThe code output for the energy coefficient, `5.96` (rounded), is also correct.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe computed values are:\n*   `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   `E ≈ 5.96mc²`\n\nThese values directly correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThis is the final answer.\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate two quantities: the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system from a stationary reference frame.\n\n### **1. Calculating the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nSince the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds, we must use the relativistic velocity-addition formula. For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities `v₁` and `v₂` relative to a stationary observer, their relative speed `v_rel` is given by:\n\n`v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut, `v₁ = 0.6c`\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut, `v₂ = 0.5c`\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.142857c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, **`v_rel ≈ 0.14c`**.\n\n### **2. Calculating the Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy `E` of a moving particle is given by the relativistic energy formula:\n\n`E = γ * m₀ * c²`\n\nwhere:\n*   `m₀` is the rest mass.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts (`E_total = E₁ + E₂`).\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):**\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ₁`:\n    `γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Calculate the energy `E₁`:\n    `E₁ = γ₁ * m₀₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):**\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Calculate the energy `E₂`:\n    `E₂ = γ₂ * m₀₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc²`\n\n**Total Energy of the System:**\n*   `E_total = E₁ + E₂`\n*   `E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²`\n*   `E_total = 5.9641 mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, **`E ≈ 5.96 mc²`**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately `0.14c`, and the total energy is approximately `5.96 mc²`.

Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)\n\nSince the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds, we must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ as measured from a common reference frame, their relative velocity $v_{rel}$ is given by:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculation of Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ moving at velocity $v$ is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$).\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5mc^2$\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n*   Energy $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}}mc^2 = 2\\sqrt{3}mc^2 \\approx 3.464mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3}mc^2 = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3})mc^2$\n*   $E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464)mc^2 \\approx 5.964mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96mc².
