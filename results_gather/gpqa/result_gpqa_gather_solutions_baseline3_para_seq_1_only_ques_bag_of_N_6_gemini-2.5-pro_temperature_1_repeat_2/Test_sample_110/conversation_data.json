This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate. The enolate will act as the nucleophile.\n    *   Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) is the Michael acceptor and acts as the electrophile.\n\n3.  **Determine the site of deprotonation (enolate formation):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's examine the α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group at C1):\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-hydrogens**.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-hydrogen**.\n    *   Since only the C6 position has an α-hydrogen, the strong base (t-BuOK) must abstract this proton to form the enolate. The negative charge will be delocalized between C6 and the carbonyl oxygen.\n\n4.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate formed acts as a nucleophile, with the electron density concentrated on the C6 carbon.\n    *   This C6 nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the carbon further from the ester group).\n    *   `Enolate (from C6) + CH₂=CH-COOEt → New C-C bond between C6 and the β-carbon (CH₂)`\n    *   The intermediate formed is then protonated (typically by the solvent, t-BuOH, or during aqueous workup) to give the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the structure and name of Product A:**\n    *   The original cyclohexanone ring remains intact. A new substituent is added to the C6 position.\n    *   The new substituent is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   The product structure is the 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one skeleton with a `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group attached at C6.\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we treat the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate.\n    *   Let's name the cyclohexyl substituent. The attachment point to the main chain is designated as C1' of the substituent ring. The principal functional group on the ring (the keto group) should get the lowest possible number.\n        *   C1' is the original C6 of the ketone. It has a methyl group.\n        *   Numbering from C1' towards the keto group gives the keto group position C2'. The original C1 of the ketone is now C2' of the substituent.\n        *   The original C2 of the ketone is now C3' of the substituent. It has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   So, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael addition. The nucleophile is a nitronate anion, formed from a nitroalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** The base, KOH, deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H₂**NO₂). Protons on this carbon are acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group. The resulting carbanion (nitronate ion) is the nucleophile: `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n    *   **Electrophile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile, is the Michael acceptor.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (the carbon of the double bond that is further from the nitrile group).\n    *   `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻ + CH₃-CH=CH-CN → New C-C bond between the α-carbon of the nitroalkane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.`\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product B:**\n    *   The new bond forms between the `CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃` group and the `CH(CH₃)` group of the original nitrile.\n    *   The product structure is:\n        ```\n              NO₂\n              |\n        CH₃-CH₂-CH -- CH-CH₂-CN\n                       |\n                       CH₃\n        ```\n    *   To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (C1).\n    *   The longest chain is six carbons long: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The parent alkane is hexane, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We identify and number the substituents on this chain:\n        *   A **methyl** group is on C3.\n        *   A **nitro** group is on C4.\n    *   Combining these parts, the full IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n\nThe calculated products for both reactions match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor), and a strong base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK). This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an alpha-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) is the electrophile, specifically a Michael acceptor.\n\n3.  **Determine the site of deprotonation (enolate formation):**\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The carbonyl carbon is C1.\n    *   The alpha-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   Carbon C2 is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no alpha-protons**.\n    *   Carbon C6 is bonded to a methyl group and has **one alpha-proton**.\n    *   Since only C6 has a proton, the strong base t-BuOK will exclusively deprotonate C6 to form the thermodynamic enolate.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Perform the Michael addition:**\n    *   The negatively charged C6 of the enolate acts as a nucleophile. It attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A subsequent protonation step (e.g., from the t-butanol formed in the first step or during aqueous workup) neutralizes the intermediate to yield the final product, A.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Name the product A:**\n    *   The options provided name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The main chain is the three-carbon ester chain: `(cyclohexyl)-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`. This is an ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment as C1.\n        *   C1 (the original C6 of the ketone) has a **methyl** group.\n        *   C2 (the original C1 of the ketone) has an **oxo** group.\n        *   C3 (the original C2 of the ketone) has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents on the ring gives: **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a nitroalkane, an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (a Michael acceptor), and a strong base (KOH). This is also a **Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   The protons on the carbon alpha to the nitro group (the α-carbon) in 1-nitropropane are acidic. The base, KOH, will deprotonate this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion), which is the nucleophile.\n        *   `CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + OH⁻ ⇌ [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻ + H₂O`\n    *   The (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile) is the Michael acceptor.\n\n3.  **Perform the Michael addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitropropane anion attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the 1-nitropropane and C3 of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   Protonation by water yields the final product, B.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Name the product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent chain is a nitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon contains 6 carbons. Thus, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   There is a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and B**)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This will act as the nucleophile precursor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Electrophile:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which is a classic Michael acceptor.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will then act as a nucleophile and attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2:** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no** α-protons.\n    *   **C6:** is substituted with a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has **one** α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the bulky base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from C6. This forms a single, specific enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The β-carbon is the CH₂ group of CH₂=CHCOOEt.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is an ester enolate, which is then protonated during the workup step to give the final product, A.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The new substituent attached to C6 of the cyclohexanone ring is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n    *   To name the product, we can treat the propanoate as the parent chain, as done in the options.\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   We must now name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment to the main chain is designated as position 1 of the substituent.\n        *   **Position 1 (old C6):** Point of attachment, has a **methyl** group.\n        *   **Position 2 (old C1):** Has the carbonyl group (**oxo**).\n        *   **Position 3 (old C2):** Has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Putting it together, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The α-protons are acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group. This is the nucleophile precursor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Electrophile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (trans-crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   This reaction is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon bonded to the NO₂ group).\n    *   This forms a nitronate anion: CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group (CH₃-**CH**=CHCN).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the original nitropropane and the β-carbon of the original butenenitrile.\n    *   The intermediate carbanion (at the α-position to the nitrile) is protonated by water to give the final product, B.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is: CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1. The chain is 6 carbons long. So, the parent alkane is hexane, and the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Now we number the chain and identify the substituents:\n        *   **C1:** -CN\n        *   **C2:** -CH₂-\n        *   **C3:** -CH(CH₃)- (a **methyl** group is at C3)\n        *   **C4:** -CH(NO₂)- (a **nitro** group is at C4)\n        *   **C5:** -CH₂-\n        *   **C6:** -CH₃\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nOnly option A correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction A Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is the nucleophile precursor.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is the electrophile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will then attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3. It has **no α-hydrogens**.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group, C1, C5, and one **α-hydrogen**.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only deprotonate the ketone at the C6 position to form the enolate. The negative charge is delocalized between C6 and the carbonyl oxygen.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The structure of the added group is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n    *   The resulting product structure has the -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt group attached to C6 of the original ketone.\n\n4.  **Naming the Product A:**\n    *   The options provide IUPAC names where the product is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate. The main chain is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`, which means a cyclohexyl ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain. This matches our connectivity: `(cyclohexyl)-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   Now, we need to name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules for such complex substituents, the ring is numbered starting from the point of attachment.\n    *   Let's re-number the cyclohexanone ring for naming the substituent:\n        *   **New C1:** This is the old C6, the point of attachment. It has a **methyl** group.\n        *   **New C2:** This is the old C1. It has the **oxo** (=O) group.\n        *   **New C3:** This is the old C2. It has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the name of the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name for product A in options C and D.\n\n### Reaction B Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The α-protons (on the carbon attached to the -NO₂ group) are acidic. This will be the nucleophile.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is the electrophile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Carbanion Formation:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates 1-nitropropane at the α-carbon (C1 of the propane chain) to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): `[CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. The attack occurs at the β-carbon.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon from the nitropropane anion attacks the β-carbon (the CH group bonded to the methyl group) of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the original butene chain.\n\n4.  **Protonation and Naming the Product B:**\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion is protonated (by H₂O) to give the final product.\n    *   Let's assemble the structure: `(CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)) - (CH(CH₃)CH₂(α)CN)`.\n    *   The linear structure is: **CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN**.\n    *   To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n        *   The chain is 6 carbons long, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n        *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-C(1)N`\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.

The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), which is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). The α-carbons are C-2 and C-6.\n    *   C-2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group attached, so it has no α-protons.\n    *   C-6 has a methyl group and one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only abstract the proton from C-6 to form the enolate.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate formed at C-6 attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the attack and subsequent protonation (during workup), the ethyl acrylate moiety becomes a -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt group attached to C-6.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has the cyclohexanone core with its original substituents, plus the new group at C-6.\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexanone ring with:\n        *   An oxo (=O) group at C-1.\n        *   An ethyl and a methyl group at C-2.\n        *   A methyl group and a -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt group at C-6.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The options provided name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. This means the `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` part is treated as the parent chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C-6).\n        *   **C-1' (attachment point):** Has a methyl group.\n        *   **C-2' (original C-1):** Has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   **C-3' (original C-2):** Has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction. The α-protons of a nitroalkane are acidic and can be removed by a base like KOH to form a nitronate anion, which is a potent carbon nucleophile. This nucleophile then attacks the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation:**\n    *   The nitroalkane is 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   The base (KOH) removes a proton from the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group), which is C-1.\n    *   This forms the nucleophilic nitronate anion: [CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile (C-3 of the butene chain).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C-1 of the 1-nitropropane and C-3 of the but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The nitropropane fragment is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-`.\n    *   The butenenitrile fragment, after attack and protonation by water, is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Combining these fragments gives the final product:\n        ```\n             NO₂\n             |\n        CH₃-CH₂-CH - CH-CH₂-CN\n                        |\n                        CH₃\n        ```\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so this is the basis of the name.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (C-1).\n    *   The chain is: CN(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃.\n    *   The parent chain has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C-3 and a **nitro** group at C-4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the full name of Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = correct, B = incorrect\n*   B) A = incorrect, B = correct\n*   C) A = incorrect, B = incorrect\n*   **D) A = correct, B = correct**\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone at the α-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Formation of the enolate:**\n    *   The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has one acidic α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from C6. This forms a single enolate where the negative charge (and nucleophilicity) is localized at C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate formed from the cyclohexanone attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   The nucleophile is the C6 of the cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   The attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The initial adduct is an enolate of the ester, which is then protonated during the work-up step (implicitly assumed) to give the final product.\n    *   The reaction is:\n        (enolate at C6) + CH₂=CH-COOEt → (Ring)-C6-CH₂-CH⁻-COOEt\n        (Ring)-C6-CH₂-CH⁻-COOEt + H⁺ (workup) → (Ring)-C6-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has the original substituted cyclohexanone ring, with a new `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` (ethyl propanoate) group attached at C6.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are: a carbonyl at C1, an ethyl and a methyl at C2, and a methyl and the new chain at C6.\n    *   The options provide names where the ethyl propanoate is the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent. Let's analyze the names based on this convention.\n    *   The substituent is attached to C3 of the propanoate chain, so the name is `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   The numbering of the cyclohexyl substituent ring starts from the point of attachment (our C6). Let's call this C1'.\n    *   Following the ring atoms from C1' (our C6) towards the carbonyl group (our C1):\n        *   C1' (our C6) has a methyl group.\n        *   C2' (our C1) has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   C3' (our C2) has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   So, the substituent name should be `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl`.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options B and D: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   The name in options A and C, `...-4-oxocyclohexyl`, implies the ketone is at C4' of the substituent ring, which is incorrect as the ketone is adjacent (at C2') to the point of attachment (C1').\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is another Michael addition. KOH is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane. The resulting nitronate anion is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile).\n\n2.  **Formation of the nucleophile:**\n    *   1-nitropropane is CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂. The α-carbon (C1) has two acidic protons.\n    *   KOH abstracts one of these protons to form the nitronate anion, which has a resonance structure with a carbanion at the α-carbon: CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group.\n    *   The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   Attack: (CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂) + (CH₃-CH=CH-CN) → CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH⁻-CN\n    *   The resulting carbanion is protonated by water (H₂O) to yield the final product.\n    *   Product: CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   We need to find the IUPAC name for CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the suffix is `-nitrile`.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons. So, the parent alkane is hexane, and the parent name is `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   CN is C1\n        *   -CH₂- is C2\n        *   -CH(CH₃)- is C3\n        *   -CH(NO₂)- is C4\n        *   -CH₂- is C5\n        *   -CH₃ is C6\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Listing them alphabetically, the name is: `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options A and B.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nCombining these results, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction. We have a ketone (which can form an enolate, the Michael donor), an α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor), and a base (t-BuOK) to catalyze the enolate formation.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael donor and enolate formation:**\n    *   The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. To form an enolate, the base must remove an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   Let's look at the α-carbons:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no** α-hydrogens.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C5. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one** α-hydrogen.\n    *   Since C6 is the only α-carbon with a hydrogen, the bulky base t-BuOK must deprotonate this position to form the enolate. There is no ambiguity or competition between kinetic and thermodynamic enolates.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is the Michael acceptor. The nucleophilic attack will occur at the β-carbon (the CH₂ group).\n\n4.  **The Michael addition step:**\n    *   The enolate formed from the ketone attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The initial product is an enolate of the ester, which is then protonated (likely by the conjugate acid of the base, t-BuOH, or during workup) to give the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the structure and name of Product A:**\n    *   The new group attached to C6 of the ring is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt (a 2-(ethoxycarbonyl)ethyl group).\n    *   The product molecule is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl-6-(2-(ethoxycarbonyl)ethyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Now, we must match this structure to the IUPAC names given in the options.

This means the ethyl propanoate chain is the base, and the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment to the propanoate chain as C1.\n        *   The attachment point is the original **C6** of the ketone. This carbon also has a **methyl group**. So, we have a **1-methyl** substituent on the ring.\n        *   The original carbonyl carbon **C1** is now **C2** in the substituent numbering. It has the oxo group. So, it's a **2-oxo** ring.\n        *   The original **C2** is now **C3**. It has both an **ethyl** and a **methyl** group. So, we have **3-ethyl** and **3-methyl** substituents.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a **Michael addition**. The nitroalkane acts as the Michael donor, and the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael donor:**\n    *   1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂) has acidic protons on the carbon α to the nitro group (pKa ≈ 10). The base KOH deprotonates this carbon (C1 of the propane chain) to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻. This is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor:**\n    *   (E)-but-2-enenitrile (trans-CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is the α,β-unsaturated acceptor. The nucleophilic attack occurs at the β-carbon (the CH carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n\n4.  **The Michael addition step:**\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is an enolate stabilized by the nitrile group, which is then protonated by water to yield the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the structure and name of Product B:**\n    *   Let's trace the atoms to form the product:\n        *   The `CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃` group from 1-nitropropane attaches to the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n        *   The `CH₃-CH=CH₂-CN` skeleton becomes `CH₃-CH(Nu)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The resulting structure is:\n        ```\n              CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃\n              |\n        CH₃ - CH - CH₂ - CN\n        ```\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile group (-CN).

So, we have a **2-oxo** group.\n        *   The original C2 (with the ethyl and methyl groups) is now C3. So, we have a **3-ethyl** and a **3-methyl** group.\n    *   Combining these parts, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options **B** and **D**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction and reactants:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) is the nitroalkane. Its α-protons (on the carbon bonded to the NO₂ group) are acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is the base used to deprotonate the nitroalkane.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the nucleophile:**\n    *   The base, KOH, abstracts an acidic α-proton from C1 of 1-nitropropane. This forms a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, which acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   Nucleophile: [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻\n\n3.  **Michael Addition (Nucleophilic Attack):**\n    *   The carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   For CH₃(β)-CH(α)=CH-CN, the β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of 1-nitropropane and C3 of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting anion on the α-carbon of the nitrile is protonated by water (H₂O).\n\n     \n\n4.  **Structure and Nomenclature of Product B:**\n    *   The product structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we follow IUPAC rules. The nitrile group (-CN) has the highest priority and its carbon is numbered C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1. The chain is 6 carbons long: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The parent name is therefore **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   A **methyl** group at C3.\n        *   A **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Putting it all together, the name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options **C** and **D**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option D contains both correct product names.\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A, Correct B**)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone.\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it is a quaternary carbon with **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen. It is a tertiary carbon with **one α-proton**.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the only available α-proton at the C6 position to form the enolate. The double bond of the enolate will form between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate is the nucleophile. The C6 carbon of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The β-carbon of ethyl acrylate is the CH₂ group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The initial adduct is an ester enolate, which is then protonated during workup (usually with a mild acid or water) to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The starting ketone has substituents at C2 (ethyl, methyl) and C6 (methyl).\n    *   The reaction adds an `ethyl propanoate` group (-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt) to the C6 carbon.\n    *   Therefore, the final product has the following substituents on the cyclohexanone ring:\n        *   C1: Carbonyl group (=O)\n        *   C2: Ethyl group, Methyl group (quaternary center)\n        *   C6: Methyl group, `-(CH₂-CH₂-COOEt)` group (becomes a new quaternary center)\n    *   Let's analyze the names given in the options for Product A. The names treat the ethyl propanoate part as the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent.\n        *   **Option C/D Name:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n        *   Let's deconstruct this name to draw its structure:\n            *   Parent chain: `ethyl ...propanoate` is `(substituent)-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`. The substituent is on C3.\n            *   Substituent: `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl`. Numbering of this ring starts from the point of attachment (C1).\n            *   C1 has a methyl group.\n            *   C2 has an oxo (=O) group.\n            *   C3 has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n        *   This structure matches the connectivity of our product derived from the mechanism. If we renumber the product `O=C1-C2(Et,Me)-...-C6(Me, -CH₂CH₂COOEt)` such that the point of attachment is C1 and the carbonyl is at C2, we get a perfect match for substituents: C1 has a methyl, C2 is oxo, C3 has an ethyl and a methyl.\n        *   **Option A/B Name:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. This name implies the oxo group is at C4 relative to the attachment point C1. This is inconsistent with the mechanism, where the addition must happen at an α-carbon (C6, which is adjacent to the carbonyl C1).\n    *   Therefore, the correct structure for Product A is described by the name `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂).

The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n        *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to C1, C3, an ethyl group, and a methyl group) and has no α-protons.\n        *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and one hydrogen). It has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the deprotonation must occur at C6, forming a single possible enolate. The negative charge will be on C6, which will act as the nucleophile.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack.** The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The β-carbon is the one further from the ester group (the CH₂ group in CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is a 1,4-conjugate addition.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation.** The resulting intermediate enolate is protonated during the reaction or workup (often by adding a proton source like H₂O) to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n    *   The final structure has the cyclohexanone ring with its original substituents, plus a new `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group attached at the C6 position.\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we identify the principal functional group, which is the ester. The parent name is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The large cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain, attached at carbon-3.\n    *   To name the substituent ring, we number its carbons. The point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as **C1**. To give the primary functional group on the ring (the ketone) the lowest possible locant, we number clockwise, making the carbonyl carbon **C2**.\n    *   Following this numbering, the substituents on the ring are:\n        *   A methyl group at **C1** (the original C6-methyl).\n        *   An oxo group at **C2** (the original C1-carbonyl).\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at **C3** (the original C2-substituents).\n    *   Putting it together, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).

This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Catalyst/Solvent:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH, a strong base) in water (H₂O).\n    *   This is another **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Carbanion Formation.** The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion). This carbanion, `CH₃CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂`, is the nucleophile.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack.** The nucleophilic carbon attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The β-carbon is the `CH` group bonded to the methyl group.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation.** The intermediate anion is protonated by the solvent (water) to give the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The reaction connects the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (`-CN`).

The t-BuOK abstracts the proton from C6, forming a single possible enolate.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The enolate anion, with the nucleophilic character on C6, attacks the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).

This is a 1,4-conjugate addition.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   Subsequent protonation (work-up, usually with a mild acid or water) of the intermediate enolate yields the final product.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Product A Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The resulting product has an `-(CH₂CH₂COOEt)` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   Let's name this product according to the convention used in the options, i.e., as an `ethyl propanoate` derivative.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, the point of attachment is designated as C1'. The principal functional group on the ring (the ketone) should have the lowest possible number, which is C2'.\n    *   The substituents on the cyclohexyl ring are:\n        *   A methyl group at C1' (originally C6).\n        *   An oxo group at C2' (originally C1).\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at C3' (originally C2).\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents gives the name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition.

This is a strong, sterically hindered base, perfect for forming enolates.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n3.  **Formation of the enolate:**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) will abstract an acidic proton from a carbon atom alpha (α) to the carbonyl group (C=O) of the ketone.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1 (the carbonyl carbon), and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen atom, C1, and C5. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since only the C6 position has an α-proton, the base must deprotonate this position.

This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (the Nucleophile):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's identify the α-carbons relative to the carbonyl group (C=O at position 1):\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group.

So the name will be **ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   Now, we must name the cyclohexyl substituent. The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is defined as C1' of the substituent ring. This C1' corresponds to C6 of the original ketone.\n    *   Let's locate the other groups relative to C1':\n        *   The methyl group that was on C6 is now on C1'.\n        *   The keto group (=O) was at C1, which is adjacent to C6. So, the keto group is at C2'.\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups were on C2, which is adjacent to C1. So, they are on C3'.\n    *   Assembling the name of the substituent: 1'-methyl, 2'-oxo, 3'-ethyl, 3'-methyl. In alphabetical order (excluding numerical prefixes), this gives `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This name matches the one provided in options B and C.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n**1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) has acidic α-protons.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (a Michael acceptor).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is also a Michael addition. The base deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nucleophilic nitronate anion, which attacks the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Determine the Nucleophile and Electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** KOH removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane (the carbon attached to the -NO₂ group) to form the nitronate anion: `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n    *   **Electrophile:** In but-2-enenitrile (N≡C¹-C²H=C³H-C⁴H₃), the electron-withdrawing nitrile group makes the double bond electrophilic. The attack occurs at the β-carbon, which is C3.\n\n3.  **Perform the Michael Addition:**\n    *   The carbanion of the nitronate attacks C3 of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give product B.\n    *   The product structure is: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   Let's check the carbon count. The product should have 3 carbons from nitropropane and 4 from butenenitrile, for a total of 7 carbons.\n    *   Let's examine the options for B:\n        *   `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`: 4 (butane) + 2 (dimethyl) = 6 carbons. This is incorrect.\n        *   `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`: 6 (hexane) + 1 (methyl) = 7 carbons. This is correct.\n    *   This analysis alone eliminates options A and C.\n    *   To confirm, let's name our derived structure: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile, so its carbon is C1. The longest carbon chain including C1 is 6 carbons long (`NC¹-C²-C³(CH₃)-C⁴(NO₂)-C⁵-C⁶`). The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name in options B and D.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option B contains both correct product names.\n\n**A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**\n**B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically hindered base.\n\n*   **Step 1: Enolate Formation**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   The C2 position is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3), so it has no α-protons.\n        *   The C6 position is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5), so it has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position, leading to the formation of a single regioisomeric enolate. The double bond of the enolate will be between C1 and C6.\n\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition**\n    *   The enolate anion is nucleophilic at the C6 carbon.\n    *   This nucleophilic C6 attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group). Ethyl acrylate is CH₂(β)=CH(α)-COOEt.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   After the attack, a new enolate is formed on the acrylate moiety, which is then protonated (e.g., during aqueous workup) to give the final product.\n\n*   **Step 3: Structure and Naming of Product A**\n    *   The starting ketone (2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one) is modified by the addition of a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group at the C6 position.\n    *   The resulting structure is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To match the naming convention in the options, we name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n        *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n        *   The substituent is attached to C3 of the propanoate chain.\n        *   The substituent is the cyclohexyl ring. We need to number the ring for naming, starting from the point of attachment. Let's call the attachment carbon C1'.\n        *   The original C6 of the ketone is now C1'. It has a methyl group.\n        *   The original C1 (the carbonyl carbon, C=O) is now C2'. So, it is a 2'-oxo group.\n        *   The original C2 (with ethyl and methyl groups) is now C3'. It has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n        *   So the substituent is named `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n        *   Putting it all together, the IUPAC name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This structure for product A matches the one given in options **C** and **D**.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Proton source:** Water (H₂O).\n\n*   **Step 1: Nucleophile Formation**\n    *   The α-hydrogens of a nitroalkane (hydrogens on the carbon bearing the nitro group) are acidic (pKa ≈ 10).\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the C1 of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion called a nitronate anion: `[CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻`. This anion is the nucleophile.\n\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN). The β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the C1 of the nitropropane and the β-carbon (C3) of the butenenitrile.\n    *   An intermediate enolate/nitrile anion is formed, which is subsequently protonated by water.\n\n*   **Step 3: Structure and Naming of Product B**\n    *   The structure is formed by connecting the C1 of the 1-nitropropyl group to the C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `(CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)) - (CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN)`\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the CN group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1.\n        `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   There is a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The systematic IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This structure for product B matches the one given in options **B** and **C**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   Based on the analysis of the first reaction, Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This eliminates options A and B.\n*   Based on the analysis of the second reaction, Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This eliminates option D.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\n**Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction, a conjugate addition of a nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n2.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n3.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):** The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion.\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5) and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can *only* occur at C6. The base removes the proton from C6, forming the corresponding enolate.\n4.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The C6 of the enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the carbon further from the ester group). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n5.  **Protonation:** The resulting intermediate anion is protonated (likely by abstracting a proton from the solvent or tert-butanol, which is formed in the first step) to yield the final product.\n6.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The product has the ethyl propanoate group (-CH₂CH₂COOEt) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone ring.\n    *   To name the final product, we must identify the principal functional group according to IUPAC nomenclature rules. The ester group has higher priority than the ketone group.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate. The main chain is the 3-carbon ester chain.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring system is treated as a substituent on carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the substituent, the point of attachment on the ring is designated as locant 1. This is the carbon that was C6 in the starting ketone.\n    *   We then number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the other substituents (oxo group, ethyl group, methyl groups).\n    *   Following the connectivity from the starting material:\n        *   New C1 (the attachment point, formerly C6) has a methyl group.\n        *   New C2 (formerly C1) has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   New C3 (formerly C2) has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Numbering from C1 towards the oxo group at C2 gives the locant set {1, 2, 3, 3} for the methyl, oxo, ethyl, and methyl groups respectively.\n    *   The name of the substituent is **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   Thus, the full name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   Comparing this with the options, this matches the name for A in options C and D. The name for A in options A and B (`...3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl...`) is structurally inconsistent with the outcome of this reaction.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n2.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n3.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** The α-protons on the carbon bearing the nitro group are acidic (pKa ≈ 10). The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion).\n    *   `CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + KOH  ⇌  [CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻ K⁺ + H₂O`\n4.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile (the carbon bonded to the methyl group). A new C-C bond is formed.\n    *   `[CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻ + CH₃CH=CHCN  →  CH₃CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)CH⁻CN`\n5.  **Protonation:** The intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n    *   `CH₃CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)CH⁻CN + H₂O → CH₃CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)CH₂CN + OH⁻`\n6.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   Let's identify the structure: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the molecule is named as a substituted nitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is identified. The chain runs from the nitrile carbon through the main backbone to the terminal methyl of the ethyl group.\n    *   `CN(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(CH₃)(C3)-CH(NO₂)(C4)-CH₂(C5)-CH₃(C6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   There is a methyl group (-CH₃) on C3 and a nitro group (-NO₂) on C4.\n    *   Alphabetically, the name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms in the product is 7 (3 from 1-nitropropane and 4 from but-2-enenitrile). Our named product, `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile` (6 in chain + 1 in methyl group), has 7 carbons.\n    *   The alternative name for B in the options is `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`. A butanenitrile with two methyl groups would have a total of 4 + 2 = 6 carbons, which is inconsistent with the reactants. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThis problem requires us to determine the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone. To act as a nucleophile, it must first be deprotonated by a base to form an enolate. The possible positions for deprotonation are the α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The α-carbons are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-hydrogens. Therefore, deprotonation cannot occur at C2.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon. It has one α-hydrogen.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base. It will readily deprotonate the only available α-hydrogen at C6.\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the CH₂ group) is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   **Step 1 (Enolate Formation):** The t-BuOK base removes the proton from C6 of the ketone, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate. The nucleophilic character resides on C6.\n    *   **Step 2 (Conjugate Addition):** The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The π electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and the π electrons of the C=O bond shift to the oxygen, forming an enolate intermediate from the acrylate moiety.\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The intermediate is protonated (e.g., by tert-butanol formed in the first step or during aqueous workup) at the α-carbon of the original acrylate to yield the final product, A.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The original ketone structure remains, but now C6 is bonded to a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group.\n    *   Let's analyze the name provided in the options: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n        *   This name treats the product as an ethyl propanoate derivative. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n        *   Let's check if the substituent name, `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl`, matches our product. The `-yl` indicates the point of attachment is C1 of the ring.\n            *   Attachment point (our old C6) is numbered as C1. It has a methyl group. This matches \"**1-methyl**\".\n            *   The adjacent carbon with the carbonyl group (our old C1) is numbered as C2. This matches \"**2-oxo**\".\n            *   The next carbon (our old C2), which has an ethyl and a methyl group, is numbered C3. This matches \"**3-ethyl**\" and \"**3-methyl**\".\n        *   The name is a valid, though complex, IUPAC name for the resulting structure.\n    *   The name provided in options B and D, `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`, suggests a 1,4-relationship between the attachment point and the oxo group, which is inconsistent with a Michael addition starting from an enolate formed adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   Therefore, product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.

The nitro group (NO₂) is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the α-hydrogens (on the carbon attached to NO₂) acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane.\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (the CH group attached to the methyl group) is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   **Step 1 (Carbanion Formation):** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an α-proton from 1-nitropropane, creating a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion).\n    *   **Step 2 (Conjugate Addition):** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate ion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product, B.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   Let's trace the atoms:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: `(NO₂)-CH-CH₂-CH₃`\n        *   From but-2-enenitrile: `(CN)-CH₂-CH-(CH₃)`\n        *   Combining them gives the skeleton: `(NO₂)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   **IUPAC Naming:**\n        *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent name ends in \"-nitrile\".\n        *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons. Thus, the parent alkane is hexane, and the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n        *   Numbering begins from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-C(1)N`\n        *   The substituents are a methyl group on C3 and a nitro group on C4.\n        *   The final name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for B given in options A and D. The name in options B and C, `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`, is incorrect as it describes a different molecular structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The product of Reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of Reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two results, we find that only option A correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.

It involves the reaction of an enolate (from the ketone) with an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (ethyl acrylate). The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base used to generate the enolate.\n\n2.  **Identify the reactants and their roles:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The base will remove an acidic α-proton from this ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt). This is the electrophile that the enolate will attack.\n    *   **Base:** t-BuOK.\n\n3.  **Formation of the enolate:**\n    *   First, we must identify the α-carbons of the ketone (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group, C=O at position 1). These are C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 (C2) is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 (C6) is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since only C6 has a proton, the base t-BuOK can only deprotonate at this position. This forms a single, specific enolate. There is no ambiguity about which enolate is formed (i.e., no kinetic vs. thermodynamic control issue here).\n\n4.  **Nucleophilic attack (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The enolate anion, with the nucleophilic character on C6, attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   In ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), the β-carbon is the CH₂ group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n5.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The initial ketone ring had substituents at C2 (ethyl, methyl) and C6 (methyl).\n    *   After the reaction, a new group, `–CH₂CH₂COOEt`, is attached to C6. Now, C6 is also a quaternary carbon, bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and the new propanoate chain.\n    *   The connectivity of the product is established.\n\n6.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   To name the product systematically according to the options, we treat the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent.\n    *   The chain is `–CH₂(β)CH₂(α)COOEt`. The ring is attached to the C3 of the propanoate (this corresponds to the β-carbon). So the name is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n    *   Now, we name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment to the main chain is numbered C1 of the substituent ring.\n        *   Our original C6 (point of attachment) becomes the new **C1**. This carbon has a methyl group.\n        *   Our original C1 (the ketone) becomes the new **C2**. This position is `oxo`.\n        *   Our original C2 becomes the new **C3**. This carbon has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent name is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options **A** and **C**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition.

The base will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n        *   **C2:** is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons**.\n        *   **C6:** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from C6. This forms a specific enolate where the nucleophilic carbon is C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate anion (with the negative charge effectively on C6) attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n\n4.  **Structure of the Product (Product A):**\n    *   After the reaction and workup (protonation), a `-(CH₂-CH₂-COOEt)` group is attached to C6 of the original ketone.\n    *   The resulting molecule is **2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n5.  **Matching with Options (Nomenclature Issue):**\n    *   The names provided in the options, such as `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`, treat the cyclohexane part as a substituent on the propanoate chain. This is a valid IUPAC naming convention. Let's try to name our product in this way: `ethyl 3-(2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl-1-oxocyclohexan-6-yl)propanoate`.\n    *   This name does not match any of the options provided. For example, option A/B is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.

The carbonyl carbon (original C1 of the ketone) becomes C2.\n        *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (original C2 of the ketone) becomes C3.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Combining everything, the full name for product A is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n    This matches the name for A given in options B and C.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → B\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael Addition.\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane. The α-carbon is the one bonded to the electron-withdrawing nitro group (-NO₂). The resulting carbanion (a nitronate) is resonance-stabilized and is a good nucleophile.\n    *   `CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂ + OH⁻  ⇌  [CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻ + H₂O`\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the deprotonated 1-nitropropane attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed. The intermediate is then protonated by water.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   Structure: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂) - CH(CH₃) - CH₂-CN`\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:** We need to find the IUPAC name.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN). The main chain must include the nitrile carbon.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons. Thus, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        `C6H₃-C5H₂-C4H(NO₂)-C3H(CH₃)-C2H₂-C1N`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name for product B is: **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n    This matches the name for B given in options B and D.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing this with the given options, only option B has both correct products.\n\n**A)** Incorrect A, Incorrect B\n**B)** Correct A, Correct B\n**C)** Correct A, Incorrect B\n**D)** Incorrect A, Correct B\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The bulky strong base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will create an enolate from the ketone. This enolate will then act as a nucleophile and attack the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), which is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons that can be removed by the base. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 carbon is quaternary, bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3. It has no α-protons.\n    *   The C6 carbon is tertiary, bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen atom, C1, and C5. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from C6, leading to the formation of a single enolate with the double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate is the nucleophile. The C6 carbon of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂ group) of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The resulting adduct, after protonation (during workup), will have a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to C6.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The product molecule is a substituted cyclohexanone. The substituents are:\n        *   An oxo group (=O) at C1.\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at C2.\n        *   A methyl group at C6.\n        *   A new `-(CH₂)-CH₂-COOEt` group also at C6.\n    *   The options provide IUPAC names where the product is named as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. Let's follow this convention.\n    *   The side chain is `-(CH₂)-CH₂-COOEt`. This is an ethyl propanoate backbone substituted at carbon 3.\n    *   The substituent at C3 is the entire cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   When a ring is a substituent, its numbering starts from the point of attachment (let's call it C1').\n    *   The attachment point is the C6 of the original ketone. So, C6 becomes C1'.\n    *   Following the ring from C1':\n        *   C1' (original C6) has a methyl group.\n        *   C2' (original C1) has the oxo group.\n        *   C3' (original C2) has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the name of the substituent ring is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name of the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options A and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael addition reaction. The base KOH deprotonates the nitroalkane to form a nucleophilic nitronate anion. This anion attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile ((E)-but-2-enenitrile).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   The protons on the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic (pKa ≈ 10).\n    *   The base KOH deprotonates the α-carbon (C1 of the propane chain) to form the carbanion [CH₃-CH₂-⁻CH-NO₂], which is stabilized by resonance with the nitro group. This is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which has the structure CH₃-CH=CH-CN.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon from the 1-nitropropane anion attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile (the carbon atom of the double bond that is further from the -CN group). The β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon (C3) of the but-2-enenitrile chain.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   Let's assemble the product structure:\n        *   The 1-nitropropane part is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)−`.\n        *   The but-2-enenitrile part becomes `−CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` after the addition and protonation (from H₂O).\n    *   Connecting these two fragments gives the final structure:\n        `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   To name this molecule using IUPAC rules, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1. The chain has 6 carbons. So, the parent alkane is hexane, and the suffix is -nitrile, giving **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Now, we number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon (C1) and locate the substituents:\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`\n    *   There is a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of the product is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options B and D.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option D contains both correct product names.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will form an enolate from the ketone, which then acts as a nucleophile in a conjugate addition to the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate.\n\n2.  **Identify the site of enolate formation:** The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. We need to find the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since there is only one possible proton to remove, the base `t-BuOK` will deprotonate C6 to form a single regiochemical enolate.\n\n3.  **Determine the product structure:** The enolate formed at C6 will attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-COOEt`). This results in a new C-C bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the terminal `CH2` of the acrylate moiety. After workup (protonation), the product will have an `-CH2CH2COOEt` group attached to C6.\n\n    The connectivity of the product is as follows:\n    *   A cyclohexanone ring with C=O at position 1.\n    *   An ethyl and a methyl group at position 2.\n    *   A methyl group and an ethyl propanoate group (`-CH2CH2COOEt`) at position 6.\n\n4.  **Name the product (Product A):** The options provide names in the format `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`, where the cyclohexyl ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   We need to number the cyclohexyl ring substituent. The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is designated C1. Numbering of the ring then proceeds to give the principal functional group on the ring (the `oxo` group) the lowest possible number.\n    *   The attachment point (C1) is the original C6 of the ketone.\n    *   Numbering C1 → C2 makes the original ketone carbonyl (C1 of the ketone) the C2 of the substituent name (i.e., `2-oxo`).\n    *   Following this numbering:\n        *   The methyl group on the original C6 is now on C1 of the substituent name.\n        *   The `oxo` group is at C2.\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups on the original C2 are now on C3 of the substituent name.\n    *   Therefore, the full name is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. The α-protons of nitroalkanes are quite acidic (pKa ≈ 10), so the base KOH will deprotonate the carbon adjacent to the nitro group.\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile:** KOH deprotonates C1 of 1-nitropropane (`CH3CH2CH2NO2`) to form the nucleophilic nitronate anion, `CH3CH2CH⁻NO2`.\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor:** The acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which has the structure `CH3-CH=CH-CN`. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (the `CH` group bearing the methyl substituent).\n4.  **Determine the product structure:** A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The carbon backbone of the product is `(NC-CH2-CH(CH3)) - (CH(NO2)-CH2-CH3)`.\n    *   Let's write this as a single chain: `NC-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(NO2)-CH2-CH3`.\n\n5.  **Name the product (Product B):** We apply IUPAC rules.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`), so the parent chain is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   `NC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)(CH3)-CH(4)(NO2)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nMatching these products with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A, Correct B**)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   This combination of reactants points to a **Michael addition reaction**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon, substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group.

We need to determine the correct IUPAC name for the cyclohexyl substituent.\n    *   Let's number the substituent ring for naming purposes. The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is defined as **C1**. This carbon was the original C6 of the ketone and has a methyl group.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, we number the ring to give the principal functional group (the ketone's carbonyl) the lowest possible number.\n    *   Starting from the point of attachment (C1), numbering towards the carbonyl group gives the C=O group position **C2**. This was the original C1 of the ketone.\n    *   Continuing this numbering, the carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) is now **C3**.\n    *   So, the substituent groups on the ring are located as follows:\n        *   Methyl group at C1 (from original C6).\n        *   Oxo group (=O) at C2 (from original C1).\n        *   Ethyl group and Methyl group at C3 (from original C2).\n    *   Assembling the name of the substituent: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of product A is therefore: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).

We have a ketone (which can form an enolate, the Michael donor), an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate, the Michael acceptor), and a strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate ion.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C3.

These protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 10) due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the -NO₂ group and resonance stabilization of the resulting anion (the nitronate).\n    *   For 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂**CH₂**NO₂), the α-carbon has two acidic protons. Deprotonation forms the nucleophile: `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   Nucleophile (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`) attacks `CH₃-`**`CH`**`=CH-CN` at the β-carbon.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Protonation and Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion is protonated by water to give the final product B.\n    *   Let's assemble the structure: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)` from 1-nitropropane is now bonded to `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` from but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The final structure is: **CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN**\n    *   To find the IUPAC name, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n        *   The chain is 6 carbons long: N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃.\n        *   The parent chain is a **hexanenitrile**.\n        *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   The IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options A and C. The name in options B and D (\"2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\") is incorrect; it has the wrong carbon count (6 carbons instead of 7) and structure.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two results points to option A as the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a classic Michael Addition reaction.\n    *   The **nucleophile** is an enolate generated from the ketone.\n    *   The **Michael acceptor** (electrophile) is ethyl acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   The **base** is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To form an enolate, a proton must be removed from a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon). The α-carbons are at positions C-2 and C-6.\n    *   The C-2 position is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C-1, and C-3) and has no α-protons.\n    *   The C-6 position has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only deprotonate the C-6 position. This regioselectivity means only one enolate is formed, with the double bond between C-1 and C-6.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C-6 of the ketone enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n    *   After the attack, an intermediate enolate is formed, which is then protonated during aqueous workup (implied) to regenerate the carbonyl group and neutralize the molecule, yielding the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The original ketone ring is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let's use the standard numbering where C=O is C-1.\n    *   The substituents are: C-2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. C-6 has a methyl group.\n    *   The new group added to C-6 is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` (from ethyl acrylate).\n    *   To name the final product according to IUPAC rules, the ester can be treated as the parent chain: `ethyl propanoate`. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on this chain.\n    *   The chain is `Substituent-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`. It's an ethyl 3-(substituent)propanoate.\n    *   Now let's name the cyclohexyl substituent. The ring is attached to the propanoate chain at what was originally C-6 of the ketone. For naming purposes, this attachment point on the ring is designated as C-1'.\n        *   C-1' (the attachment point) has a methyl group.\n        *   C-2' is the carbon with the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n        *   C-3' has the ethyl and methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named **(1,3-dimethyl-3-ethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**, which can be alphabetized to **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Combining everything, the full name for product A is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\nThis matches the name for product A in options C and D.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael Addition.\n    *   The **nucleophile** is a carbanion (specifically a nitronate ion) formed from 1-nitropropane.\n    *   The **Michael acceptor** is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n    *   The **base** is potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂). The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the protons on the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂) acidic.\n    *   KOH removes one of these α-protons to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, which acts as the carbon nucleophile.\n    *   Nucleophile: CH₃CH₂-C⁻H-NO₂\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The α-carbon of the 1-nitropropane anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-C(β)H=C(α)H-CN).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitroalkane and the β-carbon of the unsaturated nitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   Let's trace the carbon backbones:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: (NO₂)-CH-(CH₂CH₃)\n        *   From (E)-but-2-enenitrile: CH₃-CH-(CH₂CN)\n    *   Combining these at the newly formed bond gives the structure: CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).

This enolate is the **Michael donor** (nucleophile).\n    *   Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester and will act as the **Michael acceptor** (electrophile).\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Deprotonation (Enolate Formation):**\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of the ketone: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n        *   C1 is the carbonyl carbon (C=O).\n        *   The alpha-carbons are C2 and C6.\n        *   C2 is substituted with both an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n        *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   The bulky, non-nucleophilic base t-BuOK will abstract the only available acidic α-proton, which is at the C6 position. This regioselectively forms the enolate where the negative charge (or the C=C double bond in the enolate form) is associated with C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate moiety.\n    *   After workup (protonation, likely by t-butanol formed in the first step), the product is formed. The ethyl acrylate fragment becomes a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to C6.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has the following substituents on the cyclohexanone ring:\n        *   C1: =O (oxo group)\n        *   C2: ethyl and methyl groups\n        *   C6: a methyl group AND the new `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group.\n    *   To name this product in the format `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`, we treat the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment on the substituent ring is numbered as position 1. So, the original C6 of the ketone is now C1' of the cyclohexyl substituent.\n    *   This C1' has a methyl group.\n    *   We then number the rest of the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants. The path going towards the original C1 (the ketone) is C1' → C2'(=O) → C3'(Et, Me). This gives locants {1-Me, 2-oxo, 3-Et, 3-Me}. The alternative numbering gives a higher set of locants.\n    *   Combining these pieces alphabetically, the cyclohexyl substituent is named **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the product A description in options B and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\nThis reaction is also a **Michael addition**.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) has acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the nitro group (pKa ≈ 10). The base KOH will deprotonate it to form a carbanion (a nitronate ion), which is the **Michael donor**. The specific carbanion is `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n    *   (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile and serves as the **Michael acceptor**.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (the `CH` carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon (C3) of the nitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion at the α-carbon (C2) of the nitrile is then protonated by water (H₂O) in the workup.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   Let's assemble the product from the fragments:\n        *   Nitrile fragment: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-`\n        *   Nitroalkane fragment: `-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`\n        *   Connecting these at the point of attack gives: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon chain is numbered starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons:\n        `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   We have two substituents on this hexanenitrile chain:\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃) at position C3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position C4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   We can verify the molecular formula. Reactants: C₃H₇NO₂ + C₄H₅N = C₇H₁₂N₂O₂. Product (3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile): C₇H₁₂N₂O₂. The formula matches. The alternative name for product B given in options A/B, 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (C₆H₁₀N₂O₂), has an incorrect molecular formula.\n    *   The name for product B matches the description in options C and D.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. (Matches B and D)\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. (Matches C and D)\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThis problem requires identifying the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions. Let's analyze each reaction step-by-step.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition. A strong, sterically hindered base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) is used to generate a nucleophile (an enolate) from the ketone, which then attacks an α,β-unsaturated compound (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Identifying the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To form an enolate, an α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is required.\n    *   The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 has a methyl group and one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible enolate that can be formed by deprotonating the ring is by abstracting the proton from C6. The base t-BuOK removes the proton from C6 to form the enolate, which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Attack:**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate (with the negative charge effectively on C6) attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The original ketone structure remains, but now C6 is bonded to a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group.\n    *   The product has the following structure: a cyclohexanone ring with the carbonyl at C1. C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. C6 has a methyl group and a `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:** The options name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate.\n    *   **Main Chain:** The added fragment comes from ethyl acrylate, and after protonation becomes an ethyl propanoate chain (`-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`).\n    *   **Numbering the Chain:** The chain is numbered starting from the ester group: `cyclohexyl-C3H₂-C2H₂-C1(=O)OEt`. The cyclohexyl group is attached to C3. So the name is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n    *   **Naming the Cyclohexyl Substituent:** We name the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent, where the point of attachment is designated as C1'.\n        *   The attachment point is the original C6 of the ketone. This becomes C1' of the substituent name. The methyl group originally on C6 is now on C1'. So, we have a `1'-methyl` group.\n        *   The carbonyl group (originally C1) is adjacent to the attachment point (C6), so it's at position C2' of the substituent. This gives the `2'-oxo` part of the name.\n        *   The carbon with the geminal ethyl and methyl groups (originally C2) is adjacent to the carbonyl C1, so it is at position C3' of the substituent. This gives `3'-ethyl` and `3'-methyl` groups.\n        *   Combining the substituent names: `(3'-ethyl-1',3'-dimethyl-2'-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n        *   The full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\nThis matches the name for A given in options A and D.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH and H₂O\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. KOH is the base.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The α-protons of nitroalkanes are acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group.\n    *   KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂`) to form a nitronate anion (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂`). This is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Attack:**\n    *   The nucleophilic nitronate attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`).\n    *   The formula for but-2-enenitrile is `C⁴H₃-C³H=C²H-C¹N`. The β-carbon is C3.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting molecule after protonation (by H₂O) is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`.\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   **Principal Functional Group:** The nitrile group (-CN) has priority, so the compound is named as a nitrile.\n    *   **Longest Carbon Chain:** We need to find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        `C⁶H₃-C⁵H₂-C⁴H(NO₂)-C³H(CH₃)-C²H₂-C¹N`\n        The longest chain has 6 carbons. So, the parent alkane is hexane, and the compound is a `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   **Numbering and Substituents:** The chain is numbered starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   There is a methyl group on C3.\n        *   There is a nitro group on C4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis matches the name for B given in options C and D.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The correct name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The correct name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these findings with the given options:\n*   A) A is correct, B is incorrect.\n*   B) A is incorrect, B is incorrect.\n*   C) A is incorrect, B is correct.\n*   D) A is correct, B is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.

Its role is to deprotonate the most acidic proton to form an enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a ketone enolate and an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound in the presence of a base is a **Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Enolate Formation.** The t-BuOK base will abstract the only available α-hydrogen from the C6 position of the cyclohexanone. This forms a nucleophilic enolate anion.\n    *   **Step 2: Michael Addition.** The enolate (nucleophilic at C6) attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation.** The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated during the workup step to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The resulting structure has an `—CH₂—CH₂—COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we should identify the principal functional group.

It involves the addition of a nucleophile (an enolate in this case) to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile:** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base. It will deprotonate the starting ketone at an α-carbon (a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group) to form an enolate ion.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's identify the α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it is a quaternary carbon with no α-protons.\n    *   **C6** is bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Since only C6 has a proton, the deprotonation must occur at C6. This forms a single regioisomeric enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6. The C6 atom will be the nucleophilic center.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor (electrophile):** The electrophile is ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt). In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system (the CH₂ group in this case).\n\n4.  **Determine the product structure:** The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between these two atoms.\n    *   The ketone ring remains.\n    *   The original substituents stay in place: an ethyl and a methyl group on C2, and a methyl group on C6.\n    *   A new group, derived from ethyl acrylate, is added to C6. After protonation during workup, this group is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n    *   So, the product has a cyclohexanone ring where C6 is now a quaternary center, bonded to the C5 of the ring, the C1 of the ring (carbonyl carbon), a methyl group, and the new -CH₂CH₂COOEt group.\n\n5.  **Name the product (Product A):** According to IUPAC nomenclature, the ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone. Therefore, the molecule is named as a derivative of ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl ...propanoate`: `EtO-C(=O)-CH₂(α)-CH₂(β)-`. The cyclohexanone part is a substituent on the β-carbon. Let's renumber this part for naming.\n    *   The propanoate chain is attached to the cyclohexyl ring. The cyclohexyl ring is the substituent. The point of attachment on the ring is assigned C1 for the substituent name. In our product, this is C6 of the original ketone.\n    *   Let's establish the new numbering for the substituent name:\n        *   **C1 (new)** = C6 (old) → Point of attachment. It has a methyl group.\n        *   **C2 (new)** = C1 (old) → Has the carbonyl (oxo) group.\n        *   **C3 (new)** = C2 (old) → Has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Putting it together, the substituent name is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full product name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n6.  **Compare with options:** This name for Product A matches the one given in options B and C. The name in options A and D places the oxo group at C4, which would result from an incorrect reaction pathway. Thus, we can eliminate options A and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction 2 Analysis**\n\n**Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH and H₂O.\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael addition.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile:** The base KOH deprotonates 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic (pKa ≈ 10). The deprotonation occurs at C1, forming a nitronate anion, which acts as the nucleophile. The nucleophilic atom is C1 of the 1-nitropropane.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor (electrophile):** The electrophile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃−CH=CH−CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The nucleophile will attack the β-carbon (the CH attached to the methyl group).\n\n4.  **Determine the product structure:** The nucleophilic C1 of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon (C3) of but-2-enenitrile. A new C-C bond is formed.\n    *   The fragment from 1-nitropropane is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-`.\n    *   The fragment from but-2-enenitrile, after addition and protonation by H₂O, is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Combining these fragments gives the final product: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n5.  **Name the product (Product B):** According to IUPAC nomenclature, the nitrile group (-CN) is the principal functional group.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        `CN(1) - CH₂(2) - CH(CH₃)(3) - CH(NO₂)(4) - CH₂(5) - CH₃(6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full product name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n6.  **Compare with options:** This name for Product B matches the one given in options A and C. The name in options B and D, `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`, corresponds to a different structure that would not be formed from the given reactants.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nMatching these two products with the given choices, we find that **Option C** is the only one that correctly identifies both major products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n**Reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as the base.\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition, a conjugate addition of a nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n2.  **Identify the Michael donor (nucleophile):** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, bulky base. It will deprotonate the ketone at the α-carbon to form an enolate. The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons relative to the carbonyl group (C=O at C-1).\n    *   **C-2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no protons to be abstracted.\n    *   **C-6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible position for deprotonation is C-6. The bulky t-BuOK abstracts the proton from C-6 to form a thermodynamically stable enolate.\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor (electrophile):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the CH₂ group) is the electrophilic site for the conjugate addition.\n4.  **The reaction mechanism:**\n    *   The enolate formed from the cyclohexanone (nucleophilic at C-6) attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A subsequent protonation step (usually from workup or the conjugate acid of the base) yields the final product.\n5.  **Determine the product structure (A):**\n    *   Starting ketone structure at the relevant carbons: ...-C(Et)(Me)-C(=O)-CH₂-...-CH(Me)-...\n    *   The hydrogen at C-6 is replaced by the group derived from ethyl acrylate, which is `-CH₂CH₂COOEt`.\n    *   The final product structure has the following connections:\n        *   C-1: Carbonyl group (C=O)\n        *   C-2: Substituted with one ethyl and one methyl group.\n        *   C-6: Substituted with one methyl group and one `-(CH₂)₂-COOEt` (3-ethoxy-3-oxopropyl) group.\n6.  **Name the product (A):**\n    *   The options name the product as a substituted `ethyl propanoate`. This means the ethyl propanoate part is considered the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent attached to C-3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   We need to name the `(...-cyclohexyl)` substituent. According to IUPAC rules, when a substituted ring is named as a substituent, the point of attachment is numbered C-1.\n    *   Let's renumber the ring based on this rule:\n        *   C-1 (of the substituent) is the original C-6 (the point of attachment). It is substituted with a methyl group.\n        *   C-2 is the original C-1, which bears the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   C-3 is the original C-2, which bears an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Putting this together, the substituent name is:\n        *   `3-ethyl`\n        *   `1,3-dimethyl` (one methyl at the attachment point C-1, and another at C-3)\n        *   `2-oxo`\n        *   `cyclohexyl`\n    *   So, the full name for the substituent is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full product name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n**Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH and H₂O.\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition.\n2.  **Identify the Michael donor (nucleophile):** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The nitro group (NO₂) is strongly electron-withdrawing, which makes the protons on the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the NO₂ group) acidic. The strong base KOH deprotonates the α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor (electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (the CH attached to the methyl group) is the electrophilic site.\n4.  **The reaction mechanism:**\n    *   The carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   An intermediate enolate/cyanocarbanion is formed, which is then protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n5.  **Determine the product structure (B):**\n    *   The α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (`-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`) bonds to the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (`-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`).\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n6.  **Name the product (B):**\n    *   We use IUPAC nomenclature. The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the suffix is `-nitrile`. The carbon of the CN group is C-1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C-1. The chain is 6 carbons long (`hexanenitrile`).\n    *   Numbering the chain from the CN group:\n        `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   Identify and locate the substituents on this chain:\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃) at C-3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at C-4.\n    *   The full product name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile -> (A is incorrect, B is correct)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile -> (A is correct, B is correct)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile -> (A is incorrect, B is incorrect)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile -> (A is correct, B is incorrect)\n\nThe only option where both products are named correctly is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will generate a nucleophile from the ketone (an enolate), which will then perform a conjugate attack on the ethyl acrylate.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of the ketone (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group, C=O at position 1).\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Since only the C6 position has a proton, the base will exclusively deprotonate at C6. This forms an enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6. The steric hindrance of the base (t-BuOK) is irrelevant here as there is only one possible enolate.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C6 carbon of the enolate acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   It attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). The β-carbon is the CH₂ group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting product, after protonation (workup is implied), will have a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   The product structure is `2-ethyl-6-(2-(ethoxycarbonyl)ethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Correct Name (Product A):**\n    *   The options provide names where the product is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate. We need to match our derived structure to these names.\n    *   Let's analyze the name format: `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`. This means the parent chain is ethyl propanoate, and a substituted cyclohexyl ring is attached at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   We need to name the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment to the main chain gets the lowest possible locant, which is C1'.\n    *   So, C6 of our original ketone is now C1' of the cyclohexyl substituent. Let's trace the numbering around the ring:\n        *   **C1'**: This is the attachment point (old C6). It has a **methyl** group.\n        *   **C2'**: This was the original C1 of the ketone. It has an **oxo** (=O) group.\n        *   **C3'**: This was the original C2. It has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Combining these substituent names on the cyclohexyl ring, we get: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for Product A in options **C** and **D**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH, H₂O**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).

It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n        *   **C-6:** This carbon is bonded to the carbonyl group, a methyl group, a hydrogen atom, and C-5 of the ring. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Since there is only one possible position to deprotonate (C-6), the t-BuOK base will selectively remove the proton from C-6 to form a single regiochemical enolate. The double bond of the enolate will be between C-1 and C-6.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The enolate anion is nucleophilic at C-6. This nucleophile attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The intermediate formed is an ester enolate, which is then protonated during the work-up (likely by tert-butanol, formed from the reaction of t-BuOK with the ketone) to yield the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   A new substituent, a `-CH₂CH₂COOEt` (ethyl propanoate) group, is added to the C-6 position.\n    *   The final structure has a cyclohexanone ring with the C=O at C-1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C-2, and a methyl group plus the new `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group at C-6.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The options name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate. This is a valid IUPAC naming convention where the more complex ring is treated as a substituent on the principal chain (the propanoate chain).\n    *   The chain is `ethyl 3-(...-cyclohexyl)propanoate`, meaning the cyclohexyl ring is attached to carbon-3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Let's number the cyclohexyl ring substituent according to IUPAC rules, aiming for the lowest locants for principal groups and substituents.

It has no α-hydrogens to be removed.\n    *   **C6:** This carbon is tertiary, bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and one hydrogen atom.

This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The presence of a ketone (which can form an enolate), a Michael acceptor, and a base indicates a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Determine the Nucleophile (Enolate Formation):**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) deprotonates the ketone at an alpha-carbon to form an enolate nucleophile.\n    *   Since C2 has no alpha-hydrogens, the deprotonation must occur at C6. The bulky t-BuOK removes the single alpha-hydrogen at the less substituted C6 position.\n    *   The enolate forms between C1 and C6. This enolate anion is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Determine the Electrophile and Site of Attack:**\n    *   The electrophile is the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (the carbon further from the carbonyl/electron-withdrawing group) of the α,β-unsaturated system.

A base generates an enolate from the ketone, which then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor).\n\n**Step 1: Enolate Formation**\n1.  Identify the α-carbons of the ketone, which are the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). These are C2 and C6.\n2.  The carbon at position C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3). It has no α-hydrogens and cannot be deprotonated to form an enolate.\n3.  The carbon at position C6 has one hydrogen atom. It can be deprotonated by the base t-BuOK.\n4.  Therefore, the enolate is formed regiospecifically at C6.\n\n     \n\n**Step 2: Michael Addition**\n1.  The enolate anion at C6 is the nucleophile.\n2.  Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is the Michael acceptor. The β-carbon (the CH₂ group) is electrophilic.\n3.  The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n4.  A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexane ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n5.  After the initial addition, an enolate is formed from the ethyl acrylate part, which is then protonated (likely by abstracting a proton from the solvent or during workup) to give the final neutral product.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Naming the Product (Product A)**\n1.  The final product has an ester as the principal functional group. Therefore, the parent name is **ethyl propanoate**.\n2.  The cyclohexane ring is a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain. The connection is at carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n3.  Now, we need to name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment to the main chain is numbered as C1. The numbering proceeds around the ring to give the principal functional group on the ring (the ketone) the lowest possible number.\n    *   **Attachment point (old C6) becomes New C1.** This carbon has a methyl group.\n    *   **The keto group (old C1) becomes New C2.**\n    *   **The quaternary carbon (old C2) becomes New C3.** This carbon has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n4.  Combining the substituent names based on the new numbering:\n    *   A methyl group at C1 (1-methyl)\n    *   An oxo group at C2 (2-oxo)\n    *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at C3 (3-ethyl, 3-methyl)\n5.  The full name of the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n6.  Therefore, the full name of Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches options C and D.\n\n*(Note on Stereochemistry: The prompt mentions considering steric hindrance. In a Michael addition, the most thermodynamically stable product is usually formed. This means the large, newly added ethyl propanoate group will preferentially occupy an equatorial position on the cyclohexane chair conformer to minimize steric strain.)*\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n\n**Reactants:** 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile).\n**Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) and water (H₂O).\n**Reaction Type:** This is another Michael addition.\n\n**Step 1: Nucleophile Formation**\n1.  1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂) has acidic protons on the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group).\n2.  The base KOH deprotonates this α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion (`[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`). This is the nucleophile.\n\n**Step 2: Michael Addition**\n1.  The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n2.  A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n3.  The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Naming the Product (Product B)**\n1.  The resulting molecule is: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n2.  The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN). The parent chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n3.  The chain is 6 carbons long, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n4.  Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    `C6H₃-C5H₂-C4H(NO₂)-C3H(CH₃)-C2H₂-C1N`\n5.  The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n6.  The full name of Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name given for B in options B and D.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option D contains the correct names for both products A and B.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor), and a strong base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK). This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Determine the site of deprotonation (enolate formation):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group at C1). The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since only the C6 position has a proton, the strong base t-BuOK can only abstract this proton to form the enolate. There is no ambiguity in regioselectivity. The enolate is formed with the double bond between C1 and C6, and the nucleophilic attack will proceed from C6.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate acts as a nucleophile, with C6 attacking the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   Subsequent protonation (e.g., from t-butanol or during workup) yields the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has a `-CH₂CH₂COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   To name this product according to the IUPAC convention in the options, we treat the ester part as the parent chain: **ethyl propanoate**. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at the C3 position of this chain.\n    *   We must name the cyclohexyl substituent. The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is defined as C1' of the substituent ring. This C1' was the original C6 of the ketone.\n    *   Let's number the substituent ring to give the primary functional group (ketone) the lowest locant:\n        *   C1' (original C6): attachment point, has a **methyl** group.\n        *   C2' (original C1): has the **oxo** group.\n        *   C3' (original C2): has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Combining these parts, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a **Michael addition**. The protons on the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n    *   The base, KOH, deprotonates 1-nitropropane to form a nitronate anion, which acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   The Michael acceptor is the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n2.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form the nucleophilic nitronate anion, `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n    *   This anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting intermediate is then protonated by water.\n\n3.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The final structure connects the `CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃` group to the `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` fragment.\n    *   The product structure is: `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is the parent chain.\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons: `C⁶H₃-C⁵H₂-C⁴H(NO₂)-C³H(CH₃)-C²H₂-C¹N`. The parent name is therefore **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile carbon (C1), we locate the substituents:\n        *   A **methyl** group is at C3.\n        *   A **nitro** group is at C4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these derived names with the provided options:\n*   A) A = correct, B = incorrect (`2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile` has the wrong carbon count).\n*   B) A = **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**, B = **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile** (**Correct for both A and B**)\n*   C) A = incorrect (`...-4-oxocyclohexyl` implies wrong connectivity), B = correct.\n*   D) A = incorrect, B = incorrect.\n\nThe most consistent and correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

This will act as the nucleophile precursor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Electrophile:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which is a classic Michael acceptor.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will then act as a nucleophile and attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2:** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no** α-protons.\n    *   **C6:** is substituted with a methyl group and one hydrogen atom.

This is the nucleophile precursor.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is the electrophile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will then attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3. It has **no α-hydrogens**.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group, C1, C5, and one **α-hydrogen**.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only deprotonate the ketone at the C6 position to form the enolate. The negative charge is delocalized between C6 and the carbonyl oxygen.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The structure of the added group is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n    *   The resulting product structure has the -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt group attached to C6 of the original ketone.\n\n4.  **Naming the Product A:**\n    *   The options provide IUPAC names where the product is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate. The main chain is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`, which means a cyclohexyl ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain. This matches our connectivity: `(cyclohexyl)-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   Now, we need to name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules for such complex substituents, the ring is numbered starting from the point of attachment.\n    *   Let's re-number the cyclohexanone ring for naming the substituent:\n        *   **New C1:** This is the old C6, the point of attachment. It has a **methyl** group.\n        *   **New C2:** This is the old C1. It has the **oxo** (=O) group.\n        *   **New C3:** This is the old C2. It has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the name of the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name for product A in options C and D.\n\n### Reaction B Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The α-protons (on the carbon attached to the -NO₂ group) are acidic. This will be the nucleophile.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is the electrophile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Carbanion Formation:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates 1-nitropropane at the α-carbon (C1 of the propane chain) to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): `[CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. The attack occurs at the β-carbon.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon from the nitropropane anion attacks the β-carbon (the CH group bonded to the methyl group) of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the original butene chain.\n\n4.  **Protonation and Naming the Product B:**\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion is protonated (by H₂O) to give the final product.\n    *   Let's assemble the structure: `(CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)) - (CH(CH₃)CH₂(α)CN)`.\n    *   The linear structure is: **CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN**.\n    *   To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n        *   The chain is 6 carbons long, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n        *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-C(1)N`\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name for product B in options B and C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The analysis of Reaction A leads to the product **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This eliminates options A and B.\n*   The analysis of Reaction B leads to the product **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This eliminates options A and D.\n\nThe only option that is consistent with both analyses is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), which is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). The α-carbons are C-2 and C-6.\n    *   C-2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group attached, so it has no α-protons.\n    *   C-6 has a methyl group and one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only abstract the proton from C-6 to form the enolate.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate formed at C-6 attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the attack and subsequent protonation (during workup), the ethyl acrylate moiety becomes a -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt group attached to C-6.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has the cyclohexanone core with its original substituents, plus the new group at C-6.\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexanone ring with:\n        *   An oxo (=O) group at C-1.\n        *   An ethyl and a methyl group at C-2.\n        *   A methyl group and a -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt group at C-6.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The options provided name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. This means the `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` part is treated as the parent chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C-6).\n        *   **C-1' (attachment point):** Has a methyl group.\n        *   **C-2' (original C-1):** Has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   **C-3' (original C-2):** Has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction. The α-protons of a nitroalkane are acidic and can be removed by a base like KOH to form a nitronate anion, which is a potent carbon nucleophile. This nucleophile then attacks the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation:**\n    *   The nitroalkane is 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   The base (KOH) removes a proton from the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group), which is C-1.\n    *   This forms the nucleophilic nitronate anion: [CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile (C-3 of the butene chain).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C-1 of the 1-nitropropane and C-3 of the but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The nitropropane fragment is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-`.\n    *   The butenenitrile fragment, after attack and protonation by water, is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Combining these fragments gives the final product:\n        ```\n             NO₂\n             |\n        CH₃-CH₂-CH - CH-CH₂-CN\n                        |\n                        CH₃\n        ```\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so this is the basis of the name.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (C-1).\n    *   The chain is: CN(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃.\n    *   The parent chain has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C-3 and a **nitro** group at C-4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the full name of Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = correct, B = incorrect\n*   B) A = incorrect, B = correct\n*   C) A = incorrect, B = incorrect\n*   **D) A = correct, B = correct**\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone at the α-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Formation of the enolate:**\n    *   The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has one acidic α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from C6. This forms a single enolate where the negative charge (and nucleophilicity) is localized at C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate formed from the cyclohexanone attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   The nucleophile is the C6 of the cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   The attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The initial adduct is an enolate of the ester, which is then protonated during the work-up step (implicitly assumed) to give the final product.\n    *   The reaction is:\n        (enolate at C6) + CH₂=CH-COOEt → (Ring)-C6-CH₂-CH⁻-COOEt\n        (Ring)-C6-CH₂-CH⁻-COOEt + H⁺ (workup) → (Ring)-C6-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has the original substituted cyclohexanone ring, with a new `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` (ethyl propanoate) group attached at C6.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are: a carbonyl at C1, an ethyl and a methyl at C2, and a methyl and the new chain at C6.\n    *   The options provide names where the ethyl propanoate is the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent. Let's analyze the names based on this convention.\n    *   The substituent is attached to C3 of the propanoate chain, so the name is `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   The numbering of the cyclohexyl substituent ring starts from the point of attachment (our C6). Let's call this C1'.\n    *   Following the ring atoms from C1' (our C6) towards the carbonyl group (our C1):\n        *   C1' (our C6) has a methyl group.\n        *   C2' (our C1) has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   C3' (our C2) has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   So, the substituent name should be `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl`.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options B and D: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   The name in options A and C, `...-4-oxocyclohexyl`, implies the ketone is at C4' of the substituent ring, which is incorrect as the ketone is adjacent (at C2') to the point of attachment (C1').\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is another Michael addition. KOH is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane. The resulting nitronate anion is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile).\n\n2.  **Formation of the nucleophile:**\n    *   1-nitropropane is CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂. The α-carbon (C1) has two acidic protons.\n    *   KOH abstracts one of these protons to form the nitronate anion, which has a resonance structure with a carbanion at the α-carbon: CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group.\n    *   The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   Attack: (CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂) + (CH₃-CH=CH-CN) → CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH⁻-CN\n    *   The resulting carbanion is protonated by water (H₂O) to yield the final product.\n    *   Product: CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   We need to find the IUPAC name for CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the suffix is `-nitrile`.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons. So, the parent alkane is hexane, and the parent name is `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   CN is C1\n        *   -CH₂- is C2\n        *   -CH(CH₃)- is C3\n        *   -CH(NO₂)- is C4\n        *   -CH₂- is C5\n        *   -CH₃ is C6\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Listing them alphabetically, the name is: `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options A and B.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nCombining these results, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction. We have a ketone (which can form an enolate, the Michael donor), an α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor), and a base (t-BuOK) to catalyze the enolate formation.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael donor and enolate formation:**\n    *   The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. To form an enolate, the base must remove an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   Let's look at the α-carbons:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no** α-hydrogens.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C5. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one** α-hydrogen.\n    *   Since C6 is the only α-carbon with a hydrogen, the bulky base t-BuOK must deprotonate this position to form the enolate. There is no ambiguity or competition between kinetic and thermodynamic enolates.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is the Michael acceptor. The nucleophilic attack will occur at the β-carbon (the CH₂ group).\n\n4.  **The Michael addition step:**\n    *   The enolate formed from the ketone attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The initial product is an enolate of the ester, which is then protonated (likely by the conjugate acid of the base, t-BuOH, or during workup) to give the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the structure and name of Product A:**\n    *   The new group attached to C6 of the ring is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt (a 2-(ethoxycarbonyl)ethyl group).\n    *   The product molecule is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl-6-(2-(ethoxycarbonyl)ethyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Now, we must match this structure to the IUPAC names given in the options. The options name the molecule as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   Parent name: `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`. This means the ethyl propanoate chain is the base, and the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment to the propanoate chain as C1.\n        *   The attachment point is the original **C6** of the ketone. This carbon also has a **methyl group**. So, we have a **1-methyl** substituent on the ring.\n        *   The original carbonyl carbon **C1** is now **C2** in the substituent numbering. It has the oxo group. So, it's a **2-oxo** ring.\n        *   The original **C2** is now **C3**. It has both an **ethyl** and a **methyl** group. So, we have **3-ethyl** and **3-methyl** substituents.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a **Michael addition**. The nitroalkane acts as the Michael donor, and the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael donor:**\n    *   1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂) has acidic protons on the carbon α to the nitro group (pKa ≈ 10). The base KOH deprotonates this carbon (C1 of the propane chain) to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻. This is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor:**\n    *   (E)-but-2-enenitrile (trans-CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is the α,β-unsaturated acceptor. The nucleophilic attack occurs at the β-carbon (the CH carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n\n4.  **The Michael addition step:**\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is an enolate stabilized by the nitrile group, which is then protonated by water to yield the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the structure and name of Product B:**\n    *   Let's trace the atoms to form the product:\n        *   The `CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃` group from 1-nitropropane attaches to the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n        *   The `CH₃-CH=CH₂-CN` skeleton becomes `CH₃-CH(Nu)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The resulting structure is:\n        ```\n              CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃\n              |\n        CH₃ - CH - CH₂ - CN\n        ```\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile group (-CN).

This enolate will then act as a nucleophile and attack the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile (enolate formation):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only abstract the proton from C6. This forms a single regioselective enolate with the double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Identify the electrophile:** The electrophile is ethyl acrylate (CH2=CH-COOEt). In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system.\n\n4.  **Determine the product structure:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The initial starting ketone structure is:\n        *   C1: C=O\n        *   C2: C(Et)(Me)\n        *   C6: CH(Me)\n    *   The resulting product structure has a new substituent, -(CH2CH2COOEt), attached to C6. The final structure is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n5.  **Name the product and match with options:** We need to find the correct IUPAC name for the product. The options name the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   Let's follow this convention. The parent chain is \"ethyl ... propanoate\". The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   We number the cyclohexyl ring starting from the point of attachment (our original C6). Let's call this C1' of the substituent.\n    *   **Attachment point (C1'):** This carbon was C6 in the ketone. It has a methyl group attached. So, we have a \"1-methyl\" substituent on the ring.\n    *   **Adjacent to attachment point (C2'):** This carbon was C1 in the ketone. It has the carbonyl group. So, we have a \"2-oxo\" group.\n    *   **Carbon C3':** This carbon was C2 in the ketone. It has an ethyl and a methyl group. So, we have a \"3-ethyl\" and a \"3-methyl\" substituent.\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the name for the cyclohexyl substituent: (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name of the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This name matches the product A described in options **C** and **D**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a base that deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group (-NO2). The resulting carbanion (nitronate) is the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-nitropropane (CH3-CH2-CH2-NO2).\n    *   The α-carbon (C1) has two acidic protons. KOH deprotonates this carbon to form the nucleophilic nitronate anion: [CH3-CH2-CH-NO2]⁻.\n\n3.  **Identify the electrophile:** The electrophile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH3-CH=CH-CN). The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon.\n\n4.  **Determine the product structure:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate (C1 of the propane chain) attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile (C3 of the butene chain).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane part and C3 of the butenenitrile part.\n    *   Structure of the new molecule: CH3-CH2-CH(NO2) — CH(CH3)-CH2-CN.\n    *   The intermediate anion formed at the α-position to the nitrile is protonated by water (H2O) to yield the final product.\n\n5.  **Name the product and match with options:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so it defines the end of the parent chain (C1).\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        **C6**H3-**C5**H2-**C4**H(NO2)-**C3**H(CH3)-**C2**H2-**C1**N\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent alkane is hexane.

We need to name our product according to this convention.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent attached to the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent, the carbon atom attached to the propanoate chain is numbered C1.\n        *   The attachment point is the original C6 of the ketone. This carbon (now C1 of the substituent) has a **methyl** group.\n        *   Moving around the ring, the original C1 (the carbonyl carbon) is now C2. So, we have a **2-oxo** group.\n        *   The original C2 (with the ethyl and methyl groups) is now C3. So, we have a **3-ethyl** and a **3-methyl** group.\n    *   Combining these parts, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options **B** and **D**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction and reactants:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) is the nitroalkane. Its α-protons (on the carbon bonded to the NO₂ group) are acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is the base used to deprotonate the nitroalkane.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the nucleophile:**\n    *   The base, KOH, abstracts an acidic α-proton from C1 of 1-nitropropane. This forms a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, which acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   Nucleophile: [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻\n\n3.  **Michael Addition (Nucleophilic Attack):**\n    *   The carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   For CH₃(β)-CH(α)=CH-CN, the β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of 1-nitropropane and C3 of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting anion on the α-carbon of the nitrile is protonated by water (H₂O).\n\n     \n\n4.  **Structure and Nomenclature of Product B:**\n    *   The product structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we follow IUPAC rules.

This is a ketone.\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it is a quaternary carbon with **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen. It is a tertiary carbon with **one α-proton**.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the only available α-proton at the C6 position to form the enolate. The double bond of the enolate will form between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate is the nucleophile. The C6 carbon of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The β-carbon of ethyl acrylate is the CH₂ group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The initial adduct is an ester enolate, which is then protonated during workup (usually with a mild acid or water) to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The starting ketone has substituents at C2 (ethyl, methyl) and C6 (methyl).\n    *   The reaction adds an `ethyl propanoate` group (-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt) to the C6 carbon.\n    *   Therefore, the final product has the following substituents on the cyclohexanone ring:\n        *   C1: Carbonyl group (=O)\n        *   C2: Ethyl group, Methyl group (quaternary center)\n        *   C6: Methyl group, `-(CH₂-CH₂-COOEt)` group (becomes a new quaternary center)\n    *   Let's analyze the names given in the options for Product A. The names treat the ethyl propanoate part as the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent.\n        *   **Option C/D Name:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n        *   Let's deconstruct this name to draw its structure:\n            *   Parent chain: `ethyl ...propanoate` is `(substituent)-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`. The substituent is on C3.\n            *   Substituent: `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl`. Numbering of this ring starts from the point of attachment (C1).\n            *   C1 has a methyl group.\n            *   C2 has an oxo (=O) group.\n            *   C3 has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n        *   This structure matches the connectivity of our product derived from the mechanism. If we renumber the product `O=C1-C2(Et,Me)-...-C6(Me, -CH₂CH₂COOEt)` such that the point of attachment is C1 and the carbonyl is at C2, we get a perfect match for substituents: C1 has a methyl, C2 is oxo, C3 has an ethyl and a methyl.\n        *   **Option A/B Name:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. This name implies the oxo group is at C4 relative to the attachment point C1. This is inconsistent with the mechanism, where the addition must happen at an α-carbon (C6, which is adjacent to the carbonyl C1).\n    *   Therefore, the correct structure for Product A is described by the name `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂).

This is a ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Catalyst:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, non-nucleophilic, sterically bulky base.\n    *   The combination of a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, and a base points to a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Enolate Formation.** The base (t-BuOK) will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate. The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n        *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to C1, C3, an ethyl group, and a methyl group) and has no α-protons.\n        *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and one hydrogen). It has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the deprotonation must occur at C6, forming a single possible enolate. The negative charge will be on C6, which will act as the nucleophile.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack.** The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The β-carbon is the one further from the ester group (the CH₂ group in CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is a 1,4-conjugate addition.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation.** The resulting intermediate enolate is protonated during the reaction or workup (often by adding a proton source like H₂O) to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n    *   The final structure has the cyclohexanone ring with its original substituents, plus a new `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group attached at the C6 position.\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we identify the principal functional group, which is the ester. The parent name is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The large cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain, attached at carbon-3.\n    *   To name the substituent ring, we number its carbons. The point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as **C1**. To give the primary functional group on the ring (the ketone) the lowest possible locant, we number clockwise, making the carbonyl carbon **C2**.\n    *   Following this numbering, the substituents on the ring are:\n        *   A methyl group at **C1** (the original C6-methyl).\n        *   An oxo group at **C2** (the original C1-carbonyl).\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at **C3** (the original C2-substituents).\n    *   Putting it together, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent (α) to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Catalyst/Solvent:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH, a strong base) in water (H₂O).\n    *   This is another **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Carbanion Formation.** The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion). This carbanion, `CH₃CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂`, is the nucleophile.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack.** The nucleophilic carbon attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.

This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, the electrophile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). A strong, bulky base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will then attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   First, we need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are C2 and C6 relative to the carbonyl group (C1).\n    *   Let's analyze the substitution at the α-carbons:\n        *   **C2:** is substituted with one ethyl group and one methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n        *   **C6:** is substituted with one methyl group and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since there are α-protons only at the C6 position, the base (t-BuOK) can only abstract the proton from C6 to form the enolate. The enolate will have a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C6 carbon of the enolate is the nucleophilic center. It will attack the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n    *   The initial adduct is an enolate of the ester, which is then protonated during the work-up step to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The new substituent attached to the C6 position of the original ketone ring is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n    *   Let's determine the IUPAC name of the product. The product is an ethyl ester, specifically an ethyl propanoate derivative. The main chain is the propanoate.\n        *   Chain: ethyl O-C(=O)¹-CH₂²-CH₂³-\n    *   A substituted cyclohexyl group is attached to C3 of the propanoate chain. We need to name this cyclohexyl substituent.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, the numbering of the substituent ring starts at the point of attachment.\n        *   **C1'**: The attachment point (the original C6 of the ketone). It has a methyl group.\n        *   **C2'**: The adjacent carbon with the carbonyl group (the original C1). It is an \"oxo\" group.\n        *   **C3'**: The next carbon (the original C2). It has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Putting the substituent name together: (3'-ethyl-1',3'-dimethyl-2'-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The α-protons (on the carbon attached to the -NO₂ group) are acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). A strong base.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile. An α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   This is another **Michael Addition**. The base deprotonates the nitroalkane to form a nitronate anion, which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) removes an acidic α-proton from C1 of 1-nitropropane.\n    *   This forms a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion: [CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻ ↔ CH₃-CH₂-CH=N⁺(O⁻)O⁻. The nucleophilic attack occurs through the carbon atom.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is but-2-enenitrile (C⁴H₃-C³H=C²H-C¹N). The β-carbon is C3.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon (C1 of the nitropropane) attacks the electrophilic β-carbon (C3) of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed. The resulting carbanion at C2 is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   Let's assemble the product structure from the two parts:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: (CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂)\n        *   From but-2-enenitrile: (CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN)\n        *   Connecting them: CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n    *   To name the product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The parent chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        *   C¹N - C²H₂ - C³H(CH₃) - C⁴H(NO₂) - C⁵H₂ - C⁶H₃\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃) on C3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO₂) on C4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and B**)\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n**2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, bulky base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a Michael addition. The base will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate, which will then attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Deprotonation (Enolate Formation):**\n    *   First, let's draw the structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The IUPAC name indicates the following structure:\n        *   A cyclohexanone ring (C=O at C1).\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group are on C2.\n        *   A methyl group is on C6.\n        ```\n              O\n             //\n          C1--C2(Et, Me)\n         /   \\\n       C6(Me)-C5--C4--C3\n        \\______/\n        (CH₂ groups at C3, C4, C5)\n        ```\n    *   The α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C1) are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to C1, C3, an ethyl group, and a methyl group). It has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and a hydrogen). It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since deprotonation can only occur where there are α-protons, the base (t-BuOK) must abstract the single proton from C6. There is no other possibility for enolate formation. The \"steric hindrance\" consideration mentioned in the prompt is moot here, as there's no choice of proton to remove.\n\n3.  **Perform the Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate forms with the negative charge effectively on C6. This nucleophilic carbon attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   Ethyl acrylate: CH₂(β)=CH(α)-COOEt.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. The group added to C6 is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   The intermediate is protonated (by t-butanol, the conjugate acid of the base) to yield the final product, A.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product A:**\n    *   The product molecule has the `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to C6 of the original ketone ring.\n    *   To name this product using IUPAC nomenclature, we identify the principal functional group, which is the ester. The parent name is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring system is a substituent on carbon 3 of the propanoate chain. So the name will be **ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   Now, we must name the cyclohexyl substituent. The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is defined as C1' of the substituent ring. This C1' corresponds to C6 of the original ketone.\n    *   Let's locate the other groups relative to C1':\n        *   The methyl group that was on C6 is now on C1'.\n        *   The keto group (=O) was at C1, which is adjacent to C6. So, the keto group is at C2'.\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups were on C2, which is adjacent to C1. So, they are on C3'.\n    *   Assembling the name of the substituent: 1'-methyl, 2'-oxo, 3'-ethyl, 3'-methyl. In alphabetical order (excluding numerical prefixes), this gives `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This name matches the one provided in options B and C.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n**1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) has acidic α-protons.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (a Michael acceptor).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is also a Michael addition. The base deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nucleophilic nitronate anion, which attacks the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Determine the Nucleophile and Electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** KOH removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane (the carbon attached to the -NO₂ group) to form the nitronate anion: `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n    *   **Electrophile:** In but-2-enenitrile (N≡C¹-C²H=C³H-C⁴H₃), the electron-withdrawing nitrile group makes the double bond electrophilic. The attack occurs at the β-carbon, which is C3.\n\n3.  **Perform the Michael Addition:**\n    *   The carbanion of the nitronate attacks C3 of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give product B.\n    *   The product structure is: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   Let's check the carbon count. The product should have 3 carbons from nitropropane and 4 from butenenitrile, for a total of 7 carbons.\n    *   Let's examine the options for B:\n        *   `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`: 4 (butane) + 2 (dimethyl) = 6 carbons. This is incorrect.\n        *   `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`: 6 (hexane) + 1 (methyl) = 7 carbons. This is correct.\n    *   This analysis alone eliminates options A and C.\n    *   To confirm, let's name our derived structure: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile, so its carbon is C1. The longest carbon chain including C1 is 6 carbons long (`NC¹-C²-C³(CH₃)-C⁴(NO₂)-C⁵-C⁶`). The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name in options B and D.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option B contains both correct product names.\n\n**A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**\n**B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically hindered base.\n\n*   **Step 1: Enolate Formation**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   The C2 position is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3), so it has no α-protons.\n        *   The C6 position is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5), so it has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position, leading to the formation of a single regioisomeric enolate. The double bond of the enolate will be between C1 and C6.\n\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition**\n    *   The enolate anion is nucleophilic at the C6 carbon.\n    *   This nucleophilic C6 attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group). Ethyl acrylate is CH₂(β)=CH(α)-COOEt.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   After the attack, a new enolate is formed on the acrylate moiety, which is then protonated (e.g., during aqueous workup) to give the final product.\n\n*   **Step 3: Structure and Naming of Product A**\n    *   The starting ketone (2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one) is modified by the addition of a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group at the C6 position.\n    *   The resulting structure is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To match the naming convention in the options, we name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n        *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n        *   The substituent is attached to C3 of the propanoate chain.\n        *   The substituent is the cyclohexyl ring. We need to number the ring for naming, starting from the point of attachment. Let's call the attachment carbon C1'.\n        *   The original C6 of the ketone is now C1'. It has a methyl group.\n        *   The original C1 (the carbonyl carbon, C=O) is now C2'. So, it is a 2'-oxo group.\n        *   The original C2 (with ethyl and methyl groups) is now C3'. It has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n        *   So the substituent is named `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n        *   Putting it all together, the IUPAC name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This structure for product A matches the one given in options **C** and **D**.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Proton source:** Water (H₂O).\n\n*   **Step 1: Nucleophile Formation**\n    *   The α-hydrogens of a nitroalkane (hydrogens on the carbon bearing the nitro group) are acidic (pKa ≈ 10).\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the C1 of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion called a nitronate anion: `[CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻`. This anion is the nucleophile.\n\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN). The β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the C1 of the nitropropane and the β-carbon (C3) of the butenenitrile.\n    *   An intermediate enolate/nitrile anion is formed, which is subsequently protonated by water.\n\n*   **Step 3: Structure and Naming of Product B**\n    *   The structure is formed by connecting the C1 of the 1-nitropropyl group to the C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `(CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)) - (CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN)`\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).

This eliminates options A and B.\n*   Based on the analysis of the second reaction, Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This eliminates option D.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\n**Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction, a conjugate addition of a nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n2.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n3.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):** The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion.\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5) and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can *only* occur at C6. The base removes the proton from C6, forming the corresponding enolate.\n4.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The C6 of the enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the carbon further from the ester group). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n5.  **Protonation:** The resulting intermediate anion is protonated (likely by abstracting a proton from the solvent or tert-butanol, which is formed in the first step) to yield the final product.\n6.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The product has the ethyl propanoate group (-CH₂CH₂COOEt) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone ring.\n    *   To name the final product, we must identify the principal functional group according to IUPAC nomenclature rules. The ester group has higher priority than the ketone group.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate. The main chain is the 3-carbon ester chain.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring system is treated as a substituent on carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the substituent, the point of attachment on the ring is designated as locant 1. This is the carbon that was C6 in the starting ketone.\n    *   We then number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the other substituents (oxo group, ethyl group, methyl groups).\n    *   Following the connectivity from the starting material:\n        *   New C1 (the attachment point, formerly C6) has a methyl group.\n        *   New C2 (formerly C1) has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   New C3 (formerly C2) has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Numbering from C1 towards the oxo group at C2 gives the locant set {1, 2, 3, 3} for the methyl, oxo, ethyl, and methyl groups respectively.\n    *   The name of the substituent is **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   Thus, the full name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   Comparing this with the options, this matches the name for A in options C and D. The name for A in options A and B (`...3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl...`) is structurally inconsistent with the outcome of this reaction.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n2.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n3.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** The α-protons on the carbon bearing the nitro group are acidic (pKa ≈ 10). The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion).\n    *   `CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + KOH  ⇌  [CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻ K⁺ + H₂O`\n4.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile (the carbon bonded to the methyl group). A new C-C bond is formed.\n    *   `[CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻ + CH₃CH=CHCN  →  CH₃CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)CH⁻CN`\n5.  **Protonation:** The intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n    *   `CH₃CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)CH⁻CN + H₂O → CH₃CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)CH₂CN + OH⁻`\n6.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   Let's identify the structure: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the molecule is named as a substituted nitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is identified. The chain runs from the nitrile carbon through the main backbone to the terminal methyl of the ethyl group.\n    *   `CN(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(CH₃)(C3)-CH(NO₂)(C4)-CH₂(C5)-CH₃(C6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   There is a methyl group (-CH₃) on C3 and a nitro group (-NO₂) on C4.\n    *   Alphabetically, the name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms in the product is 7 (3 from 1-nitropropane and 4 from but-2-enenitrile).

A butanenitrile with two methyl groups would have a total of 4 + 2 = 6 carbons, which is inconsistent with the reactants.

This is a ketone. To act as a nucleophile, it must first be deprotonated by a base to form an enolate. The possible positions for deprotonation are the α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The α-carbons are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-hydrogens. Therefore, deprotonation cannot occur at C2.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon. It has one α-hydrogen.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base. It will readily deprotonate the only available α-hydrogen at C6.\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the CH₂ group) is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   **Step 1 (Enolate Formation):** The t-BuOK base removes the proton from C6 of the ketone, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate. The nucleophilic character resides on C6.\n    *   **Step 2 (Conjugate Addition):** The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The π electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and the π electrons of the C=O bond shift to the oxygen, forming an enolate intermediate from the acrylate moiety.\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The intermediate is protonated (e.g., by tert-butanol formed in the first step or during aqueous workup) at the α-carbon of the original acrylate to yield the final product, A.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The original ketone structure remains, but now C6 is bonded to a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group.\n    *   Let's analyze the name provided in the options: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n        *   This name treats the product as an ethyl propanoate derivative. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n        *   Let's check if the substituent name, `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl`, matches our product. The `-yl` indicates the point of attachment is C1 of the ring.\n            *   Attachment point (our old C6) is numbered as C1. It has a methyl group. This matches \"**1-methyl**\".\n            *   The adjacent carbon with the carbonyl group (our old C1) is numbered as C2. This matches \"**2-oxo**\".\n            *   The next carbon (our old C2), which has an ethyl and a methyl group, is numbered C3. This matches \"**3-ethyl**\" and \"**3-methyl**\".\n        *   The name is a valid, though complex, IUPAC name for the resulting structure.\n    *   The name provided in options B and D, `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`, suggests a 1,4-relationship between the attachment point and the oxo group, which is inconsistent with a Michael addition starting from an enolate formed adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   Therefore, product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The nitro group (NO₂) is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the α-hydrogens (on the carbon attached to NO₂) acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane.\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (the CH group attached to the methyl group) is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   **Step 1 (Carbanion Formation):** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an α-proton from 1-nitropropane, creating a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion).\n    *   **Step 2 (Conjugate Addition):** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate ion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product, B.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   Let's trace the atoms:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: `(NO₂)-CH-CH₂-CH₃`\n        *   From but-2-enenitrile: `(CN)-CH₂-CH-(CH₃)`\n        *   Combining them gives the skeleton: `(NO₂)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   **IUPAC Naming:**\n        *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent name ends in \"-nitrile\".\n        *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons. Thus, the parent alkane is hexane, and the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n        *   Numbering begins from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-C(1)N`\n        *   The substituents are a methyl group on C3 and a nitro group on C4.\n        *   The final name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for B given in options A and D. The name in options B and C, `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`, is incorrect as it describes a different molecular structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The product of Reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of Reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two results, we find that only option A correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone.\n    *   **Electrophile:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which is a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will then act as a nucleophile and attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2:** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no** α-protons.\n    *   **C6:** is substituted with a methyl group and has **one** α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only abstract the proton from C6. This forms the enolate anion at the C6 position.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Michael Addition Attack:**\n    *   The enolate anion at C6 is the nucleophile. It attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the carbon furthest from the ester group in the C=C double bond).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After the attack, the resulting enolate intermediate is protonated (e.g., by the conjugate acid of the base, t-butanol, or during workup) to give the final product.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Structure and Name of Product A:**\n    *   The final product has a `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group and a methyl group attached to C6 of the original cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   To name this product according to the options provided, we treat it as an ethyl propanoate derivative.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl ...propanoate`. The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, its attachment point (the original C6) is numbered as C1'. The numbering of the ring then proceeds to give the principal functional group (the ketone's C=O group) the lowest possible number. This places the oxo group at C2'.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are:\n        *   A methyl group at C1' (the original C6-methyl).\n        *   An oxo group at C2' (the original carbonyl).\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at C3' (the original C2 substituents).\n    *   Thus, the substituent name is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Electrophile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a strong base.\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Carbanion (Nitronate):**\n    *   The protons on the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon bonded to the NO₂ group) are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 10) due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates this α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion). `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Attack:**\n    *   The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. The resulting anion is then protonated by water.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   The product molecule is formed by connecting `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)–` to `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   The structure is: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`\n    *   To name this compound, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).

This enolate is the nucleophile that will attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the cyclohexanone enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n    *   The reaction proceeds via an enolate intermediate which is then protonated during the workup step (implicitly with a proton source like water or mild acid) to give the final stable product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.

This is the electrophile that the enolate will attack.\n    *   **Base:** t-BuOK.\n\n3.  **Formation of the enolate:**\n    *   First, we must identify the α-carbons of the ketone (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group, C=O at position 1).

The base will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n        *   **C2:** is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons**.\n        *   **C6:** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from C6. This forms a specific enolate where the nucleophilic carbon is C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate anion (with the negative charge effectively on C6) attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n\n4.  **Structure of the Product (Product A):**\n    *   After the reaction and workup (protonation), a `-(CH₂-CH₂-COOEt)` group is attached to C6 of the original ketone.\n    *   The resulting molecule is **2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n5.  **Matching with Options (Nomenclature Issue):**\n    *   The names provided in the options, such as `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`, treat the cyclohexane part as a substituent on the propanoate chain. This is a valid IUPAC naming convention. Let's try to name our product in this way: `ethyl 3-(2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl-1-oxocyclohexan-6-yl)propanoate`.\n    *   This name does not match any of the options provided. For example, option A/B is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.

Given the options, it is highly probable that the intended starting material was **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethylcyclohexan-2-one**. Assuming this correction:\n        *   **Corrected Starting Ketone:** 3-ethyl-1,3-dimethylcyclohexan-2-one. α-protons are only at C1 (C3 is quaternary).\n        *   **Enolate Formation:** The bulky base t-BuOK deprotonates the less hindered C1 position.\n        *   **Attack:** The C1 enolate attacks ethyl acrylate.\n        *   **Product:** The `-(CH₂-CH₂-COOEt)` group attaches to C1.\n        *   **Naming:** Let's name this product. The attachment point is C1, which also has a methyl group. The carbonyl is at C2. An ethyl and a methyl group are at C3.

We must identify the available α-protons.\n    *   The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The carbonyl group is at C1.\n    *   The α-carbon at position C2 has one ethyl group and one methyl group attached. It has **no** α-hydrogens.\n    *   The α-carbon at position C6 has one methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can **only** occur at the C6 position. The bulky t-BuOK base will abstract the single available α-proton at C6 to form a specific enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:** The C6 of the enolate anion acts as the nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the CH₂ group of the ethyl acrylate.

We need to find the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom.

Numbering of the ring then proceeds to give the principal functional group on the ring (the `oxo` group) the lowest possible number.\n    *   The attachment point (C1) is the original C6 of the ketone.\n    *   Numbering C1 → C2 makes the original ketone carbonyl (C1 of the ketone) the C2 of the substituent name (i.e., `2-oxo`).\n    *   Following this numbering:\n        *   The methyl group on the original C6 is now on C1 of the substituent name.\n        *   The `oxo` group is at C2.\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups on the original C2 are now on C3 of the substituent name.\n    *   Therefore, the full name is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. The α-protons of nitroalkanes are quite acidic (pKa ≈ 10), so the base KOH will deprotonate the carbon adjacent to the nitro group.\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile:** KOH deprotonates C1 of 1-nitropropane (`CH3CH2CH2NO2`) to form the nucleophilic nitronate anion, `CH3CH2CH⁻NO2`.\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor:** The acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which has the structure `CH3-CH=CH-CN`. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (the `CH` group bearing the methyl substituent).\n4.  **Determine the product structure:** A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The carbon backbone of the product is `(NC-CH2-CH(CH3)) - (CH(NO2)-CH2-CH3)`.\n    *   Let's write this as a single chain: `NC-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(NO2)-CH2-CH3`.\n\n5.  **Name the product (Product B):** We apply IUPAC rules.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`), so the parent chain is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   `NC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)(CH3)-CH(4)(NO2)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nMatching these products with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A, Correct B**)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   This combination of reactants points to a **Michael addition reaction**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon, substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon, substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the enolate must form by removing the proton from C6. The double bond of the enolate will be between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate anion (nucleophilic at C6) attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule connects the C6 of the original ketone to a `-CH₂CH₂COOEt` group.\n    *   The product is `ethyl 3-(substituted-cyclohexyl)propanoate`. We need to determine the correct IUPAC name for the cyclohexyl substituent.\n    *   Let's number the substituent ring for naming purposes. The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is defined as **C1**. This carbon was the original C6 of the ketone and has a methyl group.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, we number the ring to give the principal functional group (the ketone's carbonyl) the lowest possible number.\n    *   Starting from the point of attachment (C1), numbering towards the carbonyl group gives the C=O group position **C2**.

In CH₃-CH=CH-CN, the β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The initial adduct is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   Let's trace the connectivity of the product:\n        The `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-` group from 1-nitropropane is attached to the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n        The skeleton is: `CH₃ - CH(adds here) - CH₂ - CN`.\n        The final structure is: `CH₃ - CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃) - CH₂ - CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).

We have a ketone (which can form an enolate, the Michael donor), an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate, the Michael acceptor), and a strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate ion.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen atom, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C5. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since only the C6 carbon has a proton, the base can only deprotonate at this position.

These protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 10) due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the -NO₂ group and resonance stabilization of the resulting anion (the nitronate).\n    *   For 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂**CH₂**NO₂), the α-carbon has two acidic protons. Deprotonation forms the nucleophile: `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   Nucleophile (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`) attacks `CH₃-`**`CH`**`=CH-CN` at the β-carbon.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Protonation and Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion is protonated by water to give the final product B.\n    *   Let's assemble the structure: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)` from 1-nitropropane is now bonded to `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` from but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The final structure is: **CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN**\n    *   To find the IUPAC name, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n        *   The chain is 6 carbons long: N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃.\n        *   The parent chain is a **hexanenitrile**.\n        *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   The IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options A and C.

The α-carbons are at positions C-2 and C-6.\n    *   The C-2 position is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C-1, and C-3) and has no α-protons.\n    *   The C-6 position has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only deprotonate the C-6 position. This regioselectivity means only one enolate is formed, with the double bond between C-1 and C-6.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C-6 of the ketone enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n    *   After the attack, an intermediate enolate is formed, which is then protonated during aqueous workup (implied) to regenerate the carbonyl group and neutralize the molecule, yielding the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The original ketone ring is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let's use the standard numbering where C=O is C-1.\n    *   The substituents are: C-2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. C-6 has a methyl group.\n    *   The new group added to C-6 is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` (from ethyl acrylate).\n    *   To name the final product according to IUPAC rules, the ester can be treated as the parent chain: `ethyl propanoate`.

This regioselectively forms the enolate where the negative charge (or the C=C double bond in the enolate form) is associated with C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate moiety.\n    *   After workup (protonation, likely by t-butanol formed in the first step), the product is formed. The ethyl acrylate fragment becomes a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to C6.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has the following substituents on the cyclohexanone ring:\n        *   C1: =O (oxo group)\n        *   C2: ethyl and methyl groups\n        *   C6: a methyl group AND the new `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group.\n    *   To name this product in the format `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`, we treat the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment on the substituent ring is numbered as position 1. So, the original C6 of the ketone is now C1' of the cyclohexyl substituent.\n    *   This C1' has a methyl group.\n    *   We then number the rest of the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants. The path going towards the original C1 (the ketone) is C1' → C2'(=O) → C3'(Et, Me). This gives locants {1-Me, 2-oxo, 3-Et, 3-Me}. The alternative numbering gives a higher set of locants.\n    *   Combining these pieces alphabetically, the cyclohexyl substituent is named **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.

The specific carbanion is `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n    *   (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile and serves as the **Michael acceptor**.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (the `CH` carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon (C3) of the nitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion at the α-carbon (C2) of the nitrile is then protonated by water (H₂O) in the workup.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   Let's assemble the product from the fragments:\n        *   Nitrile fragment: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-`\n        *   Nitroalkane fragment: `-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`\n        *   Connecting these at the point of attack gives: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon chain is numbered starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons:\n        `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   We have two substituents on this hexanenitrile chain:\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃) at position C3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position C4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   We can verify the molecular formula.

The alternative name for product B given in options A/B, 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (C₆H₁₀N₂O₂), has an incorrect molecular formula.\n    *   The name for product B matches the description in options C and D.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. (Matches B and D)\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. (Matches C and D)\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThis problem requires identifying the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions. Let's analyze each reaction step-by-step.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition. A strong, sterically hindered base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) is used to generate a nucleophile (an enolate) from the ketone, which then attacks an α,β-unsaturated compound (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Identifying the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To form an enolate, an α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is required.\n    *   The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 has a methyl group and one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible enolate that can be formed by deprotonating the ring is by abstracting the proton from C6. The base t-BuOK removes the proton from C6 to form the enolate, which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Attack:**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate (with the negative charge effectively on C6) attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The original ketone structure remains, but now C6 is bonded to a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group.\n    *   The product has the following structure: a cyclohexanone ring with the carbonyl at C1. C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. C6 has a methyl group and a `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:** The options name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate.\n    *   **Main Chain:** The added fragment comes from ethyl acrylate, and after protonation becomes an ethyl propanoate chain (`-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`).\n    *   **Numbering the Chain:** The chain is numbered starting from the ester group: `cyclohexyl-C3H₂-C2H₂-C1(=O)OEt`. The cyclohexyl group is attached to C3. So the name is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n    *   **Naming the Cyclohexyl Substituent:** We name the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent, where the point of attachment is designated as C1'.\n        *   The attachment point is the original C6 of the ketone. This becomes C1' of the substituent name. The methyl group originally on C6 is now on C1'. So, we have a `1'-methyl` group.\n        *   The carbonyl group (originally C1) is adjacent to the attachment point (C6), so it's at position C2' of the substituent. This gives the `2'-oxo` part of the name.\n        *   The carbon with the geminal ethyl and methyl groups (originally C2) is adjacent to the carbonyl C1, so it is at position C3' of the substituent. This gives `3'-ethyl` and `3'-methyl` groups.\n        *   Combining the substituent names: `(3'-ethyl-1',3'-dimethyl-2'-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n        *   The full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\nThis matches the name for A given in options A and D.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH and H₂O\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. KOH is the base.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The α-protons of nitroalkanes are acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group.\n    *   KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂`) to form a nitronate anion (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂`). This is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Attack:**\n    *   The nucleophilic nitronate attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`).\n    *   The formula for but-2-enenitrile is `C⁴H₃-C³H=C²H-C¹N`. The β-carbon is C3.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting molecule after protonation (by H₂O) is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`.\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   **Principal Functional Group:** The nitrile group (-CN) has priority, so the compound is named as a nitrile.\n    *   **Longest Carbon Chain:** We need to find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        `C⁶H₃-C⁵H₂-C⁴H(NO₂)-C³H(CH₃)-C²H₂-C¹N`\n        The longest chain has 6 carbons. So, the parent alkane is hexane, and the compound is a `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   **Numbering and Substituents:** The chain is numbered starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   There is a methyl group on C3.\n        *   There is a nitro group on C4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis matches the name for B given in options C and D.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The correct name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The correct name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these findings with the given options:\n*   A) A is correct, B is incorrect.\n*   B) A is incorrect, B is incorrect.\n*   C) A is incorrect, B is correct.\n*   D) A is correct, B is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone. To find the nucleophilic site, we must identify the acidic α-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n        *   The C2 position is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon. It has **no** α-hydrogens.\n        *   The C6 position is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has **one** α-hydrogen.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base. Its role is to deprotonate the most acidic proton to form an enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a ketone enolate and an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound in the presence of a base is a **Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Enolate Formation.** The t-BuOK base will abstract the only available α-hydrogen from the C6 position of the cyclohexanone. This forms a nucleophilic enolate anion.\n    *   **Step 2: Michael Addition.** The enolate (nucleophilic at C6) attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation.** The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated during the workup step to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The resulting structure has an `—CH₂—CH₂—COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we should identify the principal functional group. The ester has higher priority than the ketone. However, given the complexity and the options provided, the naming convention treats the propanoate chain as the parent and the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent.\n    *   Let's follow this convention:\n        *   **Parent Chain:** ethyl propanoate. The new substituent is on C3.\n        *   **Substituent:** The cyclohexyl ring. For naming the substituent, numbering starts at the point of attachment. The point of attachment is the old C6 of the ketone. Let's call this C1' of the substituent ring.\n            *   **C1'**: Has a methyl group and is the point of attachment.\n            *   **C2'**: (The old C1 of the ketone) has the carbonyl group (=O), so it is a `2-oxo` group.\n            *   **C3'**: (The old C2 of the ketone) has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n        *   Combining the substituent names: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   **Final Name for A:** Putting it all together, the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\nThis matches the name for product A in options C and D.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH, H₂O**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The nitro group (NO₂) is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the protons on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon) acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base used to deprotonate the 1-nitropropane. Water (H₂O) serves as the solvent and proton source for the final step.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is another **Michael addition**. The anion of the nitroalkane (a nitronate) acts as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Carbanion Formation.** KOH removes an acidic α-proton from C1 of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion). `CH₃CH₂CH⁻—NO₂`\n    *   **Step 2: Michael Addition.** The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (the `CH` bonded to the methyl group). A new C-C bond forms.\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation.** The intermediate anion is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The reaction connects C1 of 1-nitropropane to C3 of the butenenitrile skeleton.\n    *   **Structure:** `CH₃CH₂—CH(NO₂) —CH(CH₃)—CH₂—CN`\n    *   To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n        *   **Principal Functional Group:** Nitrile.

It involves the addition of a nucleophile (an enolate in this case) to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile:** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base. It will deprotonate the starting ketone at an α-carbon (a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group) to form an enolate ion.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's identify the α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it is a quaternary carbon with no α-protons.\n    *   **C6** is bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Since only C6 has a proton, the deprotonation must occur at C6. This forms a single regioisomeric enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6. The C6 atom will be the nucleophilic center.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor (electrophile):** The electrophile is ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt). In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system (the CH₂ group in this case).\n\n4.  **Determine the product structure:** The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between these two atoms.\n    *   The ketone ring remains.\n    *   The original substituents stay in place: an ethyl and a methyl group on C2, and a methyl group on C6.\n    *   A new group, derived from ethyl acrylate, is added to C6. After protonation during workup, this group is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n    *   So, the product has a cyclohexanone ring where C6 is now a quaternary center, bonded to the C5 of the ring, the C1 of the ring (carbonyl carbon), a methyl group, and the new -CH₂CH₂COOEt group.\n\n5.  **Name the product (Product A):** According to IUPAC nomenclature, the ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone. Therefore, the molecule is named as a derivative of ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl ...propanoate`: `EtO-C(=O)-CH₂(α)-CH₂(β)-`. The cyclohexanone part is a substituent on the β-carbon. Let's renumber this part for naming.\n    *   The propanoate chain is attached to the cyclohexyl ring. The cyclohexyl ring is the substituent. The point of attachment on the ring is assigned C1 for the substituent name. In our product, this is C6 of the original ketone.\n    *   Let's establish the new numbering for the substituent name:\n        *   **C1 (new)** = C6 (old) → Point of attachment. It has a methyl group.\n        *   **C2 (new)** = C1 (old) → Has the carbonyl (oxo) group.\n        *   **C3 (new)** = C2 (old) → Has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Putting it together, the substituent name is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full product name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n6.  **Compare with options:** This name for Product A matches the one given in options B and C. The name in options A and D places the oxo group at C4, which would result from an incorrect reaction pathway. Thus, we can eliminate options A and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction 2 Analysis**\n\n**Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH and H₂O.\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael addition.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile:** The base KOH deprotonates 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic (pKa ≈ 10). The deprotonation occurs at C1, forming a nitronate anion, which acts as the nucleophile. The nucleophilic atom is C1 of the 1-nitropropane.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor (electrophile):** The electrophile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃−CH=CH−CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The nucleophile will attack the β-carbon (the CH attached to the methyl group).\n\n4.  **Determine the product structure:** The nucleophilic C1 of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon (C3) of but-2-enenitrile. A new C-C bond is formed.\n    *   The fragment from 1-nitropropane is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-`.\n    *   The fragment from but-2-enenitrile, after addition and protonation by H₂O, is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Combining these fragments gives the final product: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n5.  **Name the product (Product B):** According to IUPAC nomenclature, the nitrile group (-CN) is the principal functional group.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        `CN(1) - CH₂(2) - CH(CH₃)(3) - CH(NO₂)(4) - CH₂(5) - CH₃(6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full product name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n6.  **Compare with options:** This name for Product B matches the one given in options A and C.

It will deprotonate the ketone at the α-carbon to form an enolate. The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons relative to the carbonyl group (C=O at C-1).\n    *   **C-2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no protons to be abstracted.\n    *   **C-6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible position for deprotonation is C-6. The bulky t-BuOK abstracts the proton from C-6 to form a thermodynamically stable enolate.\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor (electrophile):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the CH₂ group) is the electrophilic site for the conjugate addition.\n4.  **The reaction mechanism:**\n    *   The enolate formed from the cyclohexanone (nucleophilic at C-6) attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A subsequent protonation step (usually from workup or the conjugate acid of the base) yields the final product.\n5.  **Determine the product structure (A):**\n    *   Starting ketone structure at the relevant carbons: ...-C(Et)(Me)-C(=O)-CH₂-...-CH(Me)-...\n    *   The hydrogen at C-6 is replaced by the group derived from ethyl acrylate, which is `-CH₂CH₂COOEt`.\n    *   The final product structure has the following connections:\n        *   C-1: Carbonyl group (C=O)\n        *   C-2: Substituted with one ethyl and one methyl group.\n        *   C-6: Substituted with one methyl group and one `-(CH₂)₂-COOEt` (3-ethoxy-3-oxopropyl) group.\n6.  **Name the product (A):**\n    *   The options name the product as a substituted `ethyl propanoate`.

The nitro group (NO₂) is strongly electron-withdrawing, which makes the protons on the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the NO₂ group) acidic. The strong base KOH deprotonates the α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor (electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (the CH attached to the methyl group) is the electrophilic site.\n4.  **The reaction mechanism:**\n    *   The carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   An intermediate enolate/cyanocarbanion is formed, which is then protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n5.  **Determine the product structure (B):**\n    *   The α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (`-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`) bonds to the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (`-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`).\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n6.  **Name the product (B):**\n    *   We use IUPAC nomenclature. The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the suffix is `-nitrile`. The carbon of the CN group is C-1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C-1. The chain is 6 carbons long (`hexanenitrile`).\n    *   Numbering the chain from the CN group:\n        `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   Identify and locate the substituents on this chain:\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃) at C-3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at C-4.\n    *   The full product name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile -> (A is incorrect, B is correct)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile -> (A is correct, B is correct)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile -> (A is incorrect, B is incorrect)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile -> (A is correct, B is incorrect)\n\nThe only option where both products are named correctly is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will generate a nucleophile from the ketone (an enolate), which will then perform a conjugate attack on the ethyl acrylate.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of the ketone (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group, C=O at position 1).\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Since only the C6 position has a proton, the base will exclusively deprotonate at C6. This forms an enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6. The steric hindrance of the base (t-BuOK) is irrelevant here as there is only one possible enolate.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C6 carbon of the enolate acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   It attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). The β-carbon is the CH₂ group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting product, after protonation (workup is implied), will have a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   The product structure is `2-ethyl-6-(2-(ethoxycarbonyl)ethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Correct Name (Product A):**\n    *   The options provide names where the product is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate. We need to match our derived structure to these names.\n    *   Let's analyze the name format: `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`. This means the parent chain is ethyl propanoate, and a substituted cyclohexyl ring is attached at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   We need to name the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment to the main chain gets the lowest possible locant, which is C1'.\n    *   So, C6 of our original ketone is now C1' of the cyclohexyl substituent. Let's trace the numbering around the ring:\n        *   **C1'**: This is the attachment point (old C6). It has a **methyl** group.\n        *   **C2'**: This was the original C1 of the ketone. It has an **oxo** (=O) group.\n        *   **C3'**: This was the original C2. It has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Combining these substituent names on the cyclohexyl ring, we get: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for Product A in options **C** and **D**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH, H₂O**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the α-protons acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a strong base.\n    *   **Solvent/Workup:** H₂O.\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon attached to the -NO₂ group).\n    *   The resulting nucleophile is the nitronate anion: `CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The carbanion of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   For `CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`, the β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   After protonation by H₂O, the product structure is: `CH₃-CH(X)-CH₂-CN`, where `X` is the added group, `CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   The full structure is `CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Correct Name (Product B):**\n    *   We need to name this structure according to IUPAC rules. The nitrile group (-CN) has higher priority than the nitro group (-NO₂), so the parent chain is a nitrile.\n    *   We must find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (C1).\n    *   The structure can be written as: `Et-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Let's number the longest chain:\n        `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   This gives a 6-carbon parent chain, so the base name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Now, we identify the substituents on this chain:\n        *   At C3, there is a **methyl** group.\n        *   At C4, there is a **nitro** group.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the full name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for Product B in options **B** and **D**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.

The double bond of the enolate will be between C-1 and C-6.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The enolate anion is nucleophilic at C-6.

Let's trace the connectivity:\n    *   `[NC-CH-CH(CH₃)]` fragment from the acceptor.\n    *   `[CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃]` fragment from the nucleophile.\n    *   Combining them gives: **NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃**\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:** The nitrile group (-CN) has the highest priority, so the compound is named as a derivative of a nitrile.\n    *   **Parent chain:** We find the longest carbon chain that includes the carbon of the nitrile group.\n        *   `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n        *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   **Substituents:** There is a **methyl group** at C3 and a **nitro group** at C4.\n    *   The full name of product **B** is: **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n    This matches the name for product B in options A and D.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing our derived product names with the given options:\n\n*   **A)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile -> **Correct**\n*   **B)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile -> Incorrect\n*   **C)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile -> Incorrect\n*   **D)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile -> Incorrect\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a cyclic ketone. Let's analyze its alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C=O at C1).\n        *   The C2 position is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3). It has no alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   The C6 position is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5). It has one alpha-hydrogen.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which is an excellent Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The presence of a ketone (which can form an enolate), a Michael acceptor, and a base indicates a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Determine the Nucleophile (Enolate Formation):**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) deprotonates the ketone at an alpha-carbon to form an enolate nucleophile.\n    *   Since C2 has no alpha-hydrogens, the deprotonation must occur at C6. The bulky t-BuOK removes the single alpha-hydrogen at the less substituted C6 position.\n    *   The enolate forms between C1 and C6. This enolate anion is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Determine the Electrophile and Site of Attack:**\n    *   The electrophile is the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (the carbon further from the carbonyl/electron-withdrawing group) of the α,β-unsaturated system. So, the enolate attacks the CH₂ carbon of CH₂=CHCOOEt.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Product Structure:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The original C6, which was tertiary (C-H), becomes a quaternary center. It is now bonded to a methyl group and the newly added `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` chain.\n    *   The structure of the product is a cyclohexanone ring with the following substituents:\n        *   C1: =O (oxo group)\n        *   C2: ethyl group and methyl group (quaternary center)\n        *   C6: methyl group and an ethyl propanoate group (`-CH₂CH₂COOEt`) (newly formed quaternary center).\n\n5.  **Name the Product (A):**\n    *   The options provide names where the ethyl propanoate is the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent. Let's follow this convention.\n    *   Parent chain: ethyl propanoate. The ring is attached at position 3, so the name is `ethyl 3-(...-cyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, the point of attachment is C1.\n        *   Point of attachment (original C6) had a methyl group -> **1-methyl**.\n        *   The ketone carbonyl (original C1) is adjacent to the point of attachment -> **2-oxo**.\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) are on the next carbon over -> C3 of the substituent ring. So, **3-ethyl** and **3-methyl**.\n    *   Combining these parts alphabetically gives the substituent name: **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the product A described in options A and B. Options C and D have an incorrect ring structure (4-oxo instead of 2-oxo).\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH and H₂O\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon) are acidic (pKa ≈ 10).\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (trans-CH₃CH=CHCN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, another classic Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Nucleophile (Carbanion Formation):**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the most acidic proton in the mixture, which is the α-proton of 1-nitropropane. This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion), which acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + OH⁻ ⇌ CH₃CH₂CH⁻(NO₂) + H₂O\n\n3.  **Determine the Electrophile and Site of Attack:**\n    *   The electrophile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile (the carbon bearing the methyl group).\n\n4.  **Formulate the Product Structure:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   1-nitropropane part: `CH₃CH₂(NO₂)CH-`\n    *   but-2-enenitrile part: `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`\n    *   Combined structure: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`\n\n5.  **Name the Product (B):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent chain is a **nitrile**.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is 6 carbons long (`CH₃-CH₂-CH-CH-CH₂-CN`). So, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-C(1)N`\n    *   Identify the substituents and their positions:\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃) is at C3 -> **3-methyl**.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO₂) is at C4 -> **4-nitro**.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the product B described in options A and C. The name in options B and D is for a molecule with a different carbon skeleton.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The correct structure for product A is named **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The correct structure for product B is named **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these findings with the given choices:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n\nOnly option A correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n\n**Reactants:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate.\n**Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n**Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction. A base generates an enolate from the ketone, which then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor).\n\n**Step 1: Enolate Formation**\n1.  Identify the α-carbons of the ketone, which are the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). These are C2 and C6.\n2.  The carbon at position C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3). It has no α-hydrogens and cannot be deprotonated to form an enolate.\n3.  The carbon at position C6 has one hydrogen atom. It can be deprotonated by the base t-BuOK.\n4.  Therefore, the enolate is formed regiospecifically at C6.\n\n     \n\n**Step 2: Michael Addition**\n1.  The enolate anion at C6 is the nucleophile.\n2.  Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is the Michael acceptor. The β-carbon (the CH₂ group) is electrophilic.\n3.  The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n4.  A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexane ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n5.  After the initial addition, an enolate is formed from the ethyl acrylate part, which is then protonated (likely by abstracting a proton from the solvent or during workup) to give the final neutral product.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Naming the Product (Product A)**\n1.  The final product has an ester as the principal functional group. Therefore, the parent name is **ethyl propanoate**.\n2.  The cyclohexane ring is a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain. The connection is at carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n3.  Now, we need to name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment to the main chain is numbered as C1. The numbering proceeds around the ring to give the principal functional group on the ring (the ketone) the lowest possible number.\n    *   **Attachment point (old C6) becomes New C1.** This carbon has a methyl group.\n    *   **The keto group (old C1) becomes New C2.**\n    *   **The quaternary carbon (old C2) becomes New C3.** This carbon has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n4.  Combining the substituent names based on the new numbering:\n    *   A methyl group at C1 (1-methyl)\n    *   An oxo group at C2 (2-oxo)\n    *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at C3 (3-ethyl, 3-methyl)\n5.  The full name of the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n6.  Therefore, the full name of Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches options C and D.\n\n*(Note on Stereochemistry: The prompt mentions considering steric hindrance. In a Michael addition, the most thermodynamically stable product is usually formed. This means the large, newly added ethyl propanoate group will preferentially occupy an equatorial position on the cyclohexane chair conformer to minimize steric strain.)*\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n\n**Reactants:** 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile).\n**Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) and water (H₂O).\n**Reaction Type:** This is another Michael addition.\n\n**Step 1: Nucleophile Formation**\n1.  1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂) has acidic protons on the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group).\n2.  The base KOH deprotonates this α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion (`[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`). This is the nucleophile.\n\n**Step 2: Michael Addition**\n1.  The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n2.  A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n3.  The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Naming the Product (Product B)**\n1.  The resulting molecule is: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n2.  The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN). The parent chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n3.  The chain is 6 carbons long, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n4.  Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    `C6H₃-C5H₂-C4H(NO₂)-C3H(CH₃)-C2H₂-C1N`\n5.  The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n6.  The full name of Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name given for B in options B and D.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option D contains the correct names for both products A and B.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
