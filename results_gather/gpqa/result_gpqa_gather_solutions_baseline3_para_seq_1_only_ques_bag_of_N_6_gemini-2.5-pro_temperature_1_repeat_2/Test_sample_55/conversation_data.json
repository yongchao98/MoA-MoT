This means it's a cascade decay:\n    |3,0,0> → intermediate state → |1,0,0>\n\n2.  **Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions:**\n    For a transition from an initial state |n, l, m> to a final state |n', l', m'>, the following rules must be satisfied:\n    *   **Parity change:** The parity of the state, given by (-1)^l, must change. This implies that Δl = l' - l must be an odd integer. For one-photon E1 transitions, this simplifies to Δl = ±1.\n    *   **Angular momentum projection:** The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = m' - m, must be 0 or ±1. (Δm = 0 corresponds to a π-polarized photon, and Δm = ±1 corresponds to σ±-polarized photons).\n    *   **Principal quantum number:** The change in the principal quantum number, Δn, can be any integer, but for decay (spontaneous emission), we must have E_initial > E_final, which generally means n_initial > n_final.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State(s):**\n    *   **First transition:** from |i> = |3, 0, 0> to |int>.\n        *   l_i = 0. According to the Δl = ±1 rule, the intermediate state must have l_int = 1.\n        *   m_i = 0. According to the Δm = 0, ±1 rule, the intermediate state can have m_int = 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   The problem implies the cascade goes via the n=2 shell, so the intermediate states are of the form |2, 1, m_int>.\n    *   **Second transition:** from |int> = |2, 1, m_int> to |f> = |1, 0, 0>.\n        *   l_int = 1. The final state has l_f = 0. The change is Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed.\n        *   m_f = 0. The change is Δm = 0 - m_int. For this to be allowed (Δm = 0, ±1), the initial m_int must be 0, +1, or -1. This is consistent with our finding for the first transition.\n\n    Therefore, there are three possible cascade routes, distinguished by the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate |2,1,m> state:\n    *   **Path -1:** |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n    *   **Path 0:**  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n    *   **Path +1:** |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of Each Route:**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. In the context of branching processes, this is the branching ratio for that specific path. The probability of a cascade path is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n    P(path m) = BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m>) × BR(|2,1,m> → |1,0,0>)\n\n    *   **Step 1: Branching Ratio for |3,0,0> → |2,1,m>**\n        The initial state |3,0,0> (a 3s state) is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the three degenerate sublevels |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> are equally probable.\n        Let Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m>) be the transition rate to a specific sublevel m. Due to rotational symmetry:\n        Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>)\n        Let's call this rate Γ₀.\n        The total decay rate of the |3,0,0> state is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. The only allowed E1 decay from 3s is to a 2p state (since 1p does not exist).\n        Γ_total(|3,0,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) + Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) + Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 3Γ₀\n        The branching ratio for the transition into a specific sublevel 'm' is:\n        BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m>) = Γ₀ / (3Γ₀) = 1/3.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Branching Ratio for |2,1,m> → |1,0,0>**\n        Once the atom is in a state |2,1,m> (a 2p state), it will decay. The only energetically lower state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the |1,0,0> state (1s), as Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 is allowed. There are no other allowed E1 decay channels.\n        Therefore, the probability of a |2,1,m> state decaying to |1,0,0> is 1.\n        BR(|2,1,m> → |1,0,0>) = 1.\n\n    *   **Overall Probability for a Specific Path:**\n        P(path m) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Each of the three possible cascade routes has a probability of 1/3. Now we check the given options:\n    A) |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n    B) |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n    C) |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and 1/3. (Correct route and probability)\n    D) |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and 2/3. (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only option that provides a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability is C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step decay (a cascade) of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$. The process is:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** The rules for an E1 transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   Parity must change. The parity of a state is given by $(-1)^l$. Since $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, parity is automatically changed, so this rule is redundant with the $\\Delta l$ rule.\n    *   For emission, the energy of the final state must be lower than the initial state, so $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Determine the intermediate state(s):**\n    *   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$\n        *   Initial state: $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying selection rules:\n            *   $\\Delta l = l_{int} - l_i = l_{int} - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l_{int} = 1$.\n            *   $\\Delta m = m_{int} - m_i = m_{int} - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m_{int}$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n            *   $n_{int} < n_i = 3$. Also, we must have $n_{int} \\ge l_{int} + 1 = 1+1=2$. The only possible value for $n_{int}$ is 2.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Initial intermediate state: $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle = |2, 1, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n        *   Final state: $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check the selection rules:\n            *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_{int} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n            *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_{int} = 0 - m_{int}$. For this to be $0, \\pm 1$, $m_{int}$ must be $0, \\pm 1$. This is consistent with the possible intermediate states we found.\n        *   The transition from any of the $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ states to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed by the selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The \"probability\" of a certain transition route refers to its branching ratio. The branching ratio for a specific decay channel is the rate of that channel divided by the total decay rate of the initial state.\n\n    *   **First transition probability:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$\n        The rate of spontaneous emission from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is given by Fermi's Golden Rule and is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n        $W_{i \\rightarrow f} \\propto |\\langle f | e\\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = e^2 (|\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2)$.\n\n        The initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to this symmetry, the atom has no preferred orientation in space. Therefore, the probability of decaying into any of the final magnetic sublevels $|f_m\\rangle = |2,1,m\\rangle$ must be the same, regardless of the value of $m$.\n        So, the transition rates are equal:\n        $W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$.\n\n        The state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ can only decay via E1 transition to a $|n,1,m\\rangle$ state. Since $n$ must be less than 3, the only possible destination is the $n=2$ level. Thus, the total decay rate of the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is the sum of the rates to these three intermediate states:\n        $W_{total} = W_{m=-1} + W_{m=0} + W_{m=1}$.\n        Since the three rates are equal, let's call them $W_m$. Then $W_{total} = 3 W_m$.\n\n        The probability (branching ratio) of decaying into a specific intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{W_{m=0}}{W_{total}} = \\frac{W_m}{3W_m} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n        Similarly, the probability of decaying into $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is $1/3$, and into $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n\n    *   **Second transition probability:** $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        Once the atom is in one of the intermediate states $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$, it needs to decay further. The only state with lower energy is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The transition to this state is allowed by E1 selection rules. Since this is the only possible decay channel, the probability of this transition occurring is 1 (or 100%).\n        $P(|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$ for $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total probability of the cascade:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    Let's consider the route proposed in option C: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The probability of this route is:\n    $P_{route} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    $P_{route} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. Incorrect probability.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $1/3$. Incorrect probability.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $1/3$. Incorrect probability.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability is C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes a decay from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through a two-step electric dipole (E1) transition. This means there is an intermediate state, and each of the two steps must obey the E1 selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for decay, the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State**\n    Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First Transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n        *   From the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$, we have $l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l'=1$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   For the principal quantum number $n'$, it must be less than 3.\n    *   **Second Transition:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   To reach the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$, we have $l_{final}=0, m_{final}=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $0 - l' = \\pm 1$. This implies $l'=1$, which is consistent with the first step.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This implies $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$, also consistent.\n    *   The energy of the intermediate state must be between the initial and final states. Since $E_n \\propto -1/n^2$, we must have $E_3 < E_{n'} < E_1$, which means $1 < n' < 3$. Thus, $n'$ must be 2.\n\n    Combining these results, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This means there are three possible transition routes. All options A, B, C, and D propose valid intermediate states according to the selection rules. We need to determine the probability.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of each Route**\n    The probability of a specific decay route is the product of the branching ratios of each step in the cascade.\n\n    **Step 1: Branching Ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a 3s state) is spherically symmetric.\n    *   The decay rate from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the transition dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$, where the square indicates a sum over the components: $|\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   Because the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric, the total decay rates to each of the degenerate final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equal due to rotational invariance. Let's call this rate $\\Gamma_1$.\n    *   The total decay rate from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state via E1 transition is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. The only states accessible from 3s via a single E1 transition are the $np$ states with $n<3$. The only such state is the 2p level. So, the total E1 decay rate is $\\Gamma_{tot,1} = \\Gamma(3,0,0\\to 2,1,-1) + \\Gamma(3,0,0\\to 2,1,0) + \\Gamma(3,0,0\\to 2,1,1) = \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_1 = 3\\Gamma_1$.\n    *   The branching ratio (probability) for the atom to take a specific path to one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states is:\n        $BR_1(m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\Gamma_{tot,1}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_1}{3\\Gamma_1} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   So, the atom has a 1/3 probability of landing in any of the three intermediate states.\n\n    **Step 2: Branching Ratio for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The intermediate state is a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (a 2p state).\n    *   We need to find the decay channels from this state. According to the E1 selection rules ($\\Delta l = \\pm 1$), a 2p state ($l=1$) can only decay to an s-state ($l=0$). The only lower-energy s-state is the 1s state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$).\n    *   Since this is the only possible decay channel for the 2p state, any atom in a 2p state will eventually decay to the 1s state with 100% probability.\n    *   Therefore, the branching ratio for this second step is 1, regardless of the value of $m'$.\n        $BR_2(m') = 1$.\n\n    **Overall Probability**\n    The total probability for a specific route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,m'\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the branching ratios for each step:\n    $P(\\text{route through } m') = BR_1(m') \\times BR_2(m') = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options**\n    This result shows that all three possible routes have the same probability of 1/3.\n    *   Route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$: Probability = 1/3\n    *   Route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$: Probability = 1/3\n    *   Route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: Probability = 1/3\n\n    Now we check the given options:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n\n    Only option D presents a valid route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies there is an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n    The process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_1} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_2} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:**\n    *   Change in principal quantum number $\\Delta n$: any integer.\n    *   Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$.\n    *   Change in magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Determine the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n    *   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n        *   Initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' = m \\pm (0,1) = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. The options provided in the question suggest that the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is also the most probable transition.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Initial intermediate state has $l'=1$. Final state has $l=0$. This satisfies $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$.\n        *   For each possible $m'$, we check $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$.\n            *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. Allowed.\n            *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. Allowed.\n            *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = +1$. Allowed.\n        *   All three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Determine the possible decay routes:**\n    Based on the selection rules, there are three possible cascade routes through the $n=2$ shell:\n    *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability (branching ratio) for each route:**\n    The probability of a particular route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step. This is because the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ has only one possible decay channel via a single dipole transition (to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state), so the branching ratio for the second step is 1 for all three routes.\n\n    The branching ratio for the first step, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$, is the ratio of the partial decay rate for that specific channel to the total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The decay rate for a transition $|i\\rangle \\to |f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    Rate$(|i\\rangle \\to |f\\rangle) \\propto \\omega^3 |\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = \\omega^3 (|\\langle f|x|i\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f|y|i\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f|z|i\\rangle|^2)$.\n\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). In spontaneous emission from a spherically symmetric state, there is no preferred direction. Therefore, the emission populates the magnetic sublevels of the final state equally.\n\n    Let's verify this by calculation. The rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ depends on the radial integral $\\mathcal{R} = \\int R_{21}(r) r^3 R_{30}(r) dr$ and an angular part.\n    *   **Rate for $m'=0$:** The transition is $\\Delta m=0$, governed by the $z$ operator ($z=r\\cos\\theta$). The squared angular matrix element is $|\\langle Y_{1,0} | \\cos\\theta | Y_{0,0} \\rangle|^2 = 1/3$.\n    *   **Rate for $m'=\\pm 1$:** The transitions are $\\Delta m=\\pm 1$, governed by the $x$ and $y$ operators ($x \\pm iy = r\\sin\\theta e^{\\pm i\\phi}$). The sum of squared angular matrix elements is $|\\langle Y_{1,\\pm 1} | x | Y_{0,0} \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle Y_{1,\\pm 1} | y | Y_{0,0} \\rangle|^2 = 1/3$.\n\n    So, the decay rates for transitions to each of the three intermediate states are equal:\n    Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle$)\n\n    Let this rate be $A_0$. The total decay rate (to the $n=2, l=1$ level) is the sum of these three rates:\n    $A_{total} = A_0 + A_0 + A_0 = 3A_0$.\n\n    The probability (branching ratio) for any one of these paths is:\n    $P(\\text{route via } m') = \\frac{\\text{Rate to } |2,1,m'\\rangle}{A_{total}} = \\frac{A_0}{3A_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$.

This decay occurs via two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state. The process is a cascade decay:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Apply Dipole Selection Rules for the First Transition:**\n    The selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer (for decay, $n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n    For the first transition, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$:\n    *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   From the options, the intermediate state has $n'=2$.

This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   This confirms that all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. All routes shown in the options are physically allowed.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of the Cascade:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n    $P(\\text{path}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n    $P(\\text{path via } m') = \\text{BR}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) \\times \\text{BR}(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Branching Ratio for Step 1:**\n    *   The branching ratio for the transition to a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is the rate of that transition divided by the total decay rate from the initial state.\n    *   The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$. This state has $l=0$ and is therefore spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the decay must proceed to each of the three magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state with equal probability.\n    *   This can be shown formally using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, where the transition rate is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $|\\langle l_i, m_i, 1, q | l_f, m_f \\rangle|^2$. For the transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$, we have $l_i=0, m_i=0, l_f=1, m_f=m', q=m'$. The coefficient is $|\\langle 0,0,1,m'|1,m' \\rangle|^2 = 1$ for all $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since the rates are equal, and there are three possible channels, the probability for each is $1/3$.\n    *   So, $\\text{BR}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each $m'=-1, 0, 1$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Branching Ratio for Step 2:**\n    *   The intermediate state is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. We need to find all possible E1 decay channels from this state.\n    *   The selection rules require $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. So the final state must have $l=0$ or $l=2$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n_{final} < 2$. The only possibility is $n_{final}=1$.\n    *   For $n=1$, the only possible value for orbital angular momentum is $l=0$.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible decay channel for the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state via a single dipole transition is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.\n    *   Since this is the only decay path, its branching ratio is 1.\n    *   $\\text{BR}(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Probability and Choose the Correct Option:**\n    *   The probability for any of the three complete cascade paths is:\n        $P(\\text{path via } m') = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   This means each of the three routes is equally likely, with a probability of $1/3$.\n    *   Now, let's examine the options:\n        A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n        B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n        C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n        D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n\n    Option D presents one of the three valid routes and provides the correctly calculated probability of $1/3$.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\n\nThe problem asks about the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (also known as the 3s state) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state) via a two-step dipole transition. We need to identify a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\nA \"dipole transition\" refers to an electric dipole (E1) transition, which is the most common type of radiative transition in atoms.\n\n### 2. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nE1 transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers $|n, l, m\\rangle$:\n*   **$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly 1.\n*   **$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or 1.\n*   **$\\Delta n$ can be any integer**: The principal quantum number is not restricted, but for a decay (emission), the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Transition Path\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden by the E1 selection rules because for this transition, $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n\nTherefore, the decay must happen in at least two steps, via an intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. This is called a cascade decay.\n\n**Step 1: Decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   Applying the selection rules for the first transition:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$. The intermediate state must be a p-state.\n    *   For a decay, the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$. Since $n=3$, possible values for $n'$ are 1 or 2. An intermediate state with $l'=1$ must have $n' \\ge 2$. Therefore, the only possible intermediate state has $n'=2$. So, the intermediate state is a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (a 2p state).\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Decay from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Intermediate state:** $|i'\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$. Here, $n'=2, l'=1$.\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   Let's check if this transition is allowed:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l=\\pm1$ rule.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = -m'$. For this to be allowed, we need $-m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$, which is true for all possible intermediate states ($m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$).\n\nConclusion: The decay must proceed via a cascade:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, where $m'$ can be -1, 0, or 1. All the routes presented in the options (A, C, D) are physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This refers to the branching ratio of the cascade. The overall probability of a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n**Probability of Step 1: $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$**\n\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$).\n*   The decay is spontaneous emission, which is isotropic (it has no preferred direction).\n*   The three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields).\n*   Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state and the isotropy of the interaction, the transition probability to each of the degenerate final substates must be equal.\n*   There are 3 possible final substates. Therefore, the probability of decaying into any single one of them is $1/3$.\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    (This is relative to the total decay rate from 3s to 2p).\n\n**Probability of Step 2: $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$**\n\n*   Once the atom is in a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (a 2p state), it needs to decay to a lower energy level.\n*   The only state with energy lower than 2p that is accessible via an E1 transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (1s state). Decay to any other state is either energetically forbidden or violates selection rules.\n*   Therefore, the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state will decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state with a probability of 1 (or a branching ratio of 100%).\n\n**Overall Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe total probability for a specific route is $P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2})$.\nFor the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$:\nProbability = $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe same logic applies to the other possible routes via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. Their probabilities are also $1/3$.\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on our findings:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    *   The route is valid. The calculated probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This option is correct.\n\n*   **B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (it should be $\\frac{1}{3}$).\n\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (it should be $\\frac{1}{3}$).\n\nTherefore, the only correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process:** The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via a two-step process, with an intermediate state. The question specifies that these are electric dipole transitions (E1).\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an E1 transition between an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number $n$ is not restricted ($\\Delta n$ can be any integer), but for a decay (spontaneous emission), energy must be released, so $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **First transition:** The atom decays from the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state $|int\\rangle = |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $l_i = 0$, so $l_{int}$ must be $1$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $m_i = 0$, so $\\Delta m = m_{int} - 0 = m_{int}$. This means $m_{int}$ can be $0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule: For decay, $n_{int} < n_i = 3$. The options provided all suggest an intermediate state with $n_{int}=2$. This is the most likely decay, as the transition frequency ($\\omega \\propto 1/n_f^2 - 1/n_i^2$) is largest for the smallest possible change in $n$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** The atom decays from the intermediate state $|int\\rangle = |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $l_{int} = 1$ and $l_f = 0$, so $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $m_f = 0$, so $\\Delta m = 0 - m_{int}$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$, which is true for all possible intermediate values of $m_{int}$ ($0, \\pm 1$).\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule: $n_f=1 < n_{int}=2$. This is allowed.\n\n    *   Conclusion: All three routes are possible:\n        *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of Each Route:**\n    *   The overall probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, assuming the intermediate state has only one path to the final state (which is true here, as $|2,1,m\\rangle$ can only decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via E1).\n    *   The branching ratio for the transition to a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ is the ratio of the rate of that specific transition to the total rate of all possible transitions from the initial state.\n    *   The transition rate $W_{i \\to f}$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element: $W_{i \\to f} \\propto |\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\mathbf{d} = e\\mathbf{r}$ is the electric dipole operator.\n    *   We need to calculate the rates for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ for $m_{int} = 0, +1, -1$. The rate is proportional to $|\\langle 2,1,m_{int} | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,m_{int} |x| 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m_{int} |y| 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m_{int} |z| 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Matrix Elements:**\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). This has a significant consequence. The Wigner-Eckart theorem shows that for a transition from a spherically symmetric state, the transition rates to each of the magnetic sublevels of the final state are equal.\n    *   Let's verify this. Let $\\mathcal{R}$ be the radial integral $\\int R_{21}(r) r R_{30}(r) r^2 dr$, which is a constant factor for all three transitions. The calculation of the angular parts gives:\n        *   For $m_{int} = 0$: The transition is driven by the $z$ component of the dipole operator. $|\\langle 2,1,0 | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,0 | z | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{1}{3}\\mathcal{R}^2$.\n        *   For $m_{int} = +1$: The transition is driven by the $x$ and $y$ components. $|\\langle 2,1,1 | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle x \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle y \\rangle|^2 = (\\frac{\\mathcal{R}^2}{6}) + (\\frac{\\mathcal{R}^2}{6}) = \\frac{1}{3}\\mathcal{R}^2$.\n        *   For $m_{int} = -1$: The calculation is similar to $m_{int}=+1$ and gives $|\\langle 2,1,-1 | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{1}{3}\\mathcal{R}^2$.\n\n6.  **Determine the Branching Ratios:**\n    *   The transition rates are equal: $W_{|300\\rangle \\to |210\\rangle} = W_{|300\\rangle \\to |211\\rangle} = W_{|300\\rangle \\to |21-1\\rangle}$. Let's call this rate $W_0$.\n    *   The only allowed E1 decays from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ are to these three states. So, the total decay rate is $W_{total} = W_0 + W_0 + W_0 = 3W_0$.\n    *   The probability (branching ratio) for any one of these routes is:\n        $P(m_{int}) = \\frac{W_0}{W_{total}} = \\frac{W_0}{3W_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$.

The probability is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Process and Selection Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies there must be an intermediate state.\n\nThe selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for decay (spontaneous emission), $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n    *   Initial state has $l=0$. According to the $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   Initial state has $m=0$. According to the $\\Delta m=0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For a decay, we need $n' < 3$. So, $n'$ can be 1 or 2. However, for $n=1$, only $l=0$ is possible ($|1,1,m'\\rangle$ does not exist). Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n    *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Second transition:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Intermediate state has $l'=1$. Final state has $l_f=0$. So $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Intermediate state has $m'$. Final state has $m_f=0$. So $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$.

Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe \"probability\" of a specific decay route in a cascade is the product of the branching ratios at each step.\n\n*   **Step 1: Branching Ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n\nThe branching ratio for a transition to a specific final state is the rate of that transition divided by the total decay rate of the initial state. The transition rate is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle final | e\\mathbf{r} | initial \\rangle|^2$.\n\nWe need to compare the transition rates from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\nA key physical principle simplifies this calculation: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a 3s state) is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay process, which is governed by the fundamental laws of electromagnetism, cannot have a preferred outcome regarding the orientation of the final state. This means that the three final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$, which are distinguished only by their magnetic quantum number $m'$ (i.e., their orientation in space), must be populated with equal probability.\n\nSince there are three possible, equiprobable outcomes for the first decay step, the probability (branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any single one of them is $1/3$.\n\nSo,\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n*(This can be confirmed with a detailed calculation using the Wigner-Eckart theorem or by explicitly computing the matrix elements, which shows that $|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$ is independent of $m'$.)*\n\n*   **Step 2: Branching Ratio for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\nOnce the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, we need to find its decay channels.\nFrom $|2,1,0\\rangle$, a dipole transition requires $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   If $\\Delta l = -1$, the final state has $l_f=0$. The only possible state with $n_f < 2$ is $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This transition is allowed.\n*   If $\\Delta l = +1$, the final state would have $l_f=2$. This requires $n_f \\ge 3$. Since this is a decay ($n_f < n'$), this channel is not possible.\n\nThus, any state in the 2p manifold ($|2,1,m'\\rangle$) can only decay to the 1s state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$) via an E1 transition. There are no other allowed E1 decay channels. Therefore, the branching ratio for this second step is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability for the Cascade**\n\nThe total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\nLet's consider the route in option C: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nProbability = $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\nProbability = $(1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\nThis same probability of $1/3$ applies to the other two possible routes as well.\n\n**4.

The mechanism for each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. We need to find the intermediate state and the probability of that specific decay path.\n\n2.  **Recall the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions:**\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number $n$ is not restricted, but for spontaneous decay, the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the first transition step: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n'',l'',m''\\rangle$**\n    *   **Initial state:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   **Selection rule for $l$:** Since $l=0$, we must have $\\Delta l = +1$, so the intermediate state must have $l'' = 1$.\n    *   **Selection rule for $m$:** Since $m=0$, we can have $\\Delta m = m'' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. This means the intermediate state can have $m'' = 0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n    *   **Selection rule for $n$:** For decay, $n'' < 3$. The problem options suggest the intermediate state has $n''=2$. This is the most probable transition since the rate depends on the cube of the transition energy ($\\omega^3$), and the $3 \\to 2$ energy gap is smaller than $3 \\to 1$, but the radial integral heavily favors the smallest possible change in $n$. The transition $3s \\to 1p$ is not possible as the $1p$ state does not exist. Thus, the only possible intermediate state is of the form $|2,1,m''\\rangle$.\n    *   **Conclusion for step 1:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the second transition step: $|2,1,m''\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   **Initial state (intermediate):** $|2,1,m''\\rangle$, so $n''=2, l''=1$.\n    *   **Final state:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$, so $n_{final}=1, l_{final}=0, m_{final}=0$.\n    *   **Selection rule for $l$:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l'' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n    *   **Selection rule for $m$:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m'' = 0 - m''$.\n        *   If the intermediate state is $|2,1,0\\rangle$ ($m''=0$), then $\\Delta m = 0$. Allowed.\n        *   If the intermediate state is $|2,1,1\\rangle$ ($m''=1$), then $\\Delta m = -1$. Allowed.\n        *   If the intermediate state is $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ ($m''=-1$), then $\\Delta m = +1$. Allowed.\n    *   **Conclusion for step 2:** All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This means all three paths are physically possible.\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability (branching ratio) of the transition paths.**\n    The probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n    $P(\\text{path}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 1:** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m''\\rangle)$\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the $2p$ state.\n        The transition rates $\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m'')$ are proportional to the square of the transition matrix element $|\\langle 2,1,m'' | e\\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$. A detailed calculation (using the Wigner-Eckart theorem or direct integration) confirms that the rates are identical for $m''=-1, 0, +1$.\n        Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for each is $1/3$.\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 2:** $P(|2,1,m''\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n        We need to consider all possible decay channels from the $|2,1,m''\\rangle$ state (the $2p$ state). According to the E1 selection rules, the atom can only decay to a state with $l=0$ or $l=2$. For decay, the final state must have a lower energy, so $n_{final} < 2$. The only state satisfying these conditions is the $1s$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$). There are no $d$-states with $n<2$.\n        Therefore, the *only* possible E1 decay from the $2p$ state is to the $1s$ state. This means the probability of this step is 1, regardless of the value of $m''$.\n        $P(|2,1,m''\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for any of the three cascade paths is $P(\\text{path}) = (1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$.\n        - Path via $|2,1,1\\rangle$: Probability = $1/3$.\n        - Path via $|2,1,0\\rangle$: Probability = $1/3$.\n        - Path via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: Probability = $1/3$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (**Correct path and probability**)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only option that presents a correct transition route with the correct corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAnswering this question requires understanding the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions in a hydrogen atom and calculating the branching ratios for the decay cascade.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states:**\n    *   Initial state: $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the $3s$ state).\n    *   Final state: $|n, l, m\\rangle = |1, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the $1s$ ground state).\n\n2.  **Analyze the decay path using selection rules:**\n    The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for emission, the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n    A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the selection rule. Therefore, the decay must occur via an intermediate state. The problem states it is a two-dipole transition process, which confirms a cascade decay.\n\n3.  **Determine the intermediate state(s):**\n    Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First transition:** $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$\n        *   Energy must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n        *   Selection rule for $l$: $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$, which implies $l'=1$. The intermediate state must be a $p$-state.\n        *   The lowest energy level with a $p$-state below $n=3$ is $n=2$. So, the intermediate state is a $2p$ state, i.e., $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Selection rule for $m$: $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, which implies $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   Thus, the first step of the decay can proceed to any of the three states: $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, or $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|2, 1, m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$\n        *   This transition is from a $2p$ state to the $1s$ ground state.\n        *   Let's check the selection rules: $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ and $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$ must be in $\\{0, \\pm 1\\}$. This is true for all possible $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   This transition is the well-known Lyman-alpha transition. It is an allowed E1 transition.\n\n    So, there are three possible decay routes, all passing through one of the $2p$ sublevels. All the routes given in the options are physically possible. We must now determine the probability of a specific route.\n\n4.  **Calculate the transition probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route, for example, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The total probability of this cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n    $P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** The $2p$ state ($|2,1,m'\\rangle$) can only decay to the $1s$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$) via an E1 transition. All other transitions are forbidden or require higher-order processes. Therefore, the probability of the second step, given the atom is in the intermediate state, is 1.\n        $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** This is the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to a specific sublevel $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. The transition rate $\\Gamma$ from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\vec{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d} = -e\\vec{r}$.\n        $\\Gamma(i \\rightarrow f) \\propto |\\langle f | \\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    Let's calculate the relative rates for the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states.\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric. The interaction Hamiltonian, when averaged over all possible emission directions and polarizations of the photon, is isotropic. This suggests that there should be no preference for any of the final $m'$ states. Therefore, the transitions to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ should be equally probable.\n\n    To confirm this, we can use the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element for a tensor operator $T_q^{(k)}$ is given by:\n    $\\langle n'l'm' | T_q^{(k)} | nlm \\rangle = \\langle lm; kq | l'm' \\rangle \\langle n'l' || T^{(k)} || nl \\rangle$.\n    Here, the operator is the position vector $\\vec{r}$, which is a rank-1 tensor ($k=1$). The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$ and the final state is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. The transition rate is proportional to:\n    $|\\langle 2,1,m' | r_q | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,m' \\rangle|^2 \\cdot |\\langle 2,1 || r || 3,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n    For the transition to be non-zero, we need $m' = m+q = 0+q = q$.\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,q \\rangle = 1$ for all possible values of $q \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    The reduced matrix element $\\langle 2,1 || r || 3,0 \\rangle$ depends only on the principal and orbital quantum numbers ($n, l, n', l'$), not on the magnetic quantum numbers.\n\n    Therefore, the transition rates are equal for all three possible final states:\n    $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle)$.\n\n    The branching ratio for the decay into any one of these specific states is:\n    $B = \\frac{\\Gamma_{\\text{one state}}}{\\Gamma_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\Gamma + \\Gamma + \\Gamma} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{3\\Gamma} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    So, the probability of the first step, e.g., $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle)$, is $1/3$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total probability and conclude:**\n    The total probability for the cascade through a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n    $P_{total} = (\\text{Branching Ratio for first step}) \\times (\\text{Probability of second step}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    Now we check the given options:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$.

Understand the Process and Selection Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a two-step decay process of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means we need to find an intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ such that both transitions are allowed by the E1 selection rules.\n\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**2. Identify the Intermediate State(s)**\n\nThe decay process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n    *   Initial state: $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n    *   Applying selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' = 0, +1, -1$.\n        *   Since it's a decay, $n' < 3$. The decay will preferentially happen to the closest available energy level, which is $n'=2$. (A transition to $n'=1$ with $l'=1$ is impossible, as the $n=1$ shell only has $l=0$).\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n', l', m'\\rangle = |2, 1, m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Let's check if this transition is allowed from our identified intermediate states.\n    *   Initial state: $n_i=2, l_i=1, m_i=m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n    *   Final state: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   Applying selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0 - m'$. This is allowed since $m'$ can be $0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   This confirms that all three states $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ are valid intermediate states. The routes proposed in all options are physically possible.\n\n**3. Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom follows a specific route. This is a product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the First Step: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The probability of the atom decaying into a specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is given by its transition rate divided by the total transition rate to all possible states. This is the branching ratio.\n    *   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element $|\\langle n_f, l_f, m_f | \\mathbf{r} | n_i, l_i, m_i \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the photon. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to transition to any of the degenerate magnetic sublevels of the final state.\n    *   The final states are the three degenerate levels $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first transition, the probability (branching ratio) for the atom to transition into any one of them is $1/3$.\n    *   So,\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n*   **Probability of the Second Step: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Once the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, we need to find the probability of its decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Let's consider all possible E1 decay channels from $|2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n        *   The selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ means the final state must have $l''=0$ or $l''=2$.\n        *   For $l''=2$ (a d-state), the principal quantum number $n''$ must be at least 3. Since this would be an excitation ($n''>2$), it cannot happen via spontaneous emission.\n        *   For $l''=0$ (an s-state), the only possible state with $n''<2$ is the $n''=1$ state, which is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Therefore, the *only* allowed E1 decay channel from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states is to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   This means that if the atom reaches the intermediate level, it is guaranteed to decay to the final state.

The process can be written as:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_1} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_2} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    where $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules:** The rules for an electric dipole transition between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n = n' - n$ can be any integer. For emission (decay), the energy must decrease, which means $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Determine the intermediate state(s) for the first transition:**\n    *   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   **Intermediate state:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules for the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$. So, the intermediate state is a p-state.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = m' = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta n = n' - 3$ must be negative, so $n' < 3$. The most probable transition is to the closest energy level, which is $n'=2$. The options provided also point to the intermediate state having $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Check the second transition:**\n    *   Let's verify that a transition from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n    *   **Intermediate state:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ with $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate $m'$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   So, all three cascade paths are allowed by the selection rules:\n        *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the transition probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    *   The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio for that route among all possible routes.\n    *   **First transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n        The rate of transition to a specific final state $|f\\rangle$ from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n        The branching ratio for a transition to a specific substate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n        $B(m') = \\frac{|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2}{\\sum_{m''=-1,0,1} |\\langle 2,1,m'' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2}$\n    *   A key physical principle is that the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a 3s state) is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). This means there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the different magnetic substates ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ level must be equally probable.\n    *   Mathematically, this can be shown using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element $\\langle n'l'm'|T_q^{(k)}|nlm\\rangle$ is proportional to a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $C_{lm;kq}^{l'm'}$. For our transition ($l=0, m=0$ to $l'=1$), the coefficients $C_{00;1q}^{1m'}$ are non-zero only if $m'=q$, and their values are all 1. This means the magnitude of the matrix element is the same for each final $m'$ state.\n    *   Since there are three possible final states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) and the probabilities are equal, the probability of transitioning to any one of them must be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   So, the probability of the first step being $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Likewise, the probability for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$, and for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle$ is also $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Analyze the second transition's probability:**\n    *   Once the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it will decay further. The only dipole-allowed transition to the $n=1$ shell is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. All other decays (e.g., to other shells) are either forbidden or have much smaller probabilities. Therefore, the probability of the second step, e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$, is essentially 1 (or 100%).\n\n7.  **Calculate the total probability for a given path:**\n    *   The total probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   For the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n        $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle)$\n        $P = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n8.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation.\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition:**\n    The problem asks about the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$ (the 3s state) to the final state $|n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$ (the 1s or ground state). This transition involves a change in the principal quantum number $\\Delta n = 1 - 3 = -2$ and no change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$.\n\n2.  **Recall Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions:**\n    Electric dipole transitions are the most common type of radiative transitions in atoms. The selection rules for an E1 transition between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer.\n\n3.  **Check for a Single-Step Transition:**\n    A direct, single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ would have $\\Delta l = 0$. This violates the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. Therefore, a single-photon electric dipole transition is forbidden.\n\n4.  **Consider a Two-Step Transition (Cascade):**\n    The problem states that the decay occurs via *two* dipole transitions. This implies a cascade process through an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    The process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{photon 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{photon 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n    We must apply the E1 selection rules to both steps of the cascade.\n\n    *   **Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Energy conservation: For a decay (photon emission), the energy must decrease. The energy of a state is $E_n \\propto -1/n^2$. So, the intermediate state must have lower energy than the initial state ($E_{n'} < E_3$), which means $n' < 3$.\n        *   Also, the intermediate state must be able to decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$, so its energy must be higher than the ground state ($E_{n'} > E_1$), which means $n' > 1$.\n        *   Combining these, the only possible value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule: $l' = l \\pm 1 = 0 \\pm 1 = 1$. So, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule: $m' = m + \\Delta m = 0 + (0, \\pm 1)$. So, the possible values for the magnetic quantum number are $m' = -1, 0, 1$.\n        *   Thus, the possible intermediate states are the three states of the 2p subshell: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Step 2: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   Let's verify that this second transition is allowed for all possible intermediate states.\n        *   Initial state: $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. Final state: $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible values of $m'$ (i.e., for $m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n        *   So, all three states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are valid intermediate states.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. Since there are three possible routes (via $m'=-1$, $m'=0$, or $m'=1$), we need to find the relative probability of each path. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first step of the decay.\n\n    The probability of a transition from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\vec{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d}=-e\\vec{r}$ is the electric dipole operator.\n\n    We are interested in the relative probabilities of the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   The three final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate in the absence of external fields.\n    *   Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state and the isotropy of space (no external fields), there is no reason for the atom to prefer decaying to one $m'$ state over another.\n    *   More formally, using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, one can show that the transition matrix elements for the transitions $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$ have a magnitude that is independent of $m'$. This means the transition rates to each of the three $m'$ states are equal.\n\n    Let $P$ be the transition rate to one specific state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$. Then the rates to $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ are also $P$. The total transition rate from the 3s state to the 2p subshell is $P_{total} = P + P + P = 3P$.\n\n    The probability (or branching ratio) for the decay to proceed through the specific intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is the ratio of the rate for that path to the total rate:\n    $$ \\text{Prob(via } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{P}{P_{total}} = \\frac{P}{3P} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n    Similarly, the probability for the decay to proceed via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is $1/3$, and via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is also $1/3$.\n\n7.  **Match with the Given Options:**\n    Let's examine the options provided:\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n\n    Our calculation shows that the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is a valid cascade, and the probability of this specific path being taken is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches option A perfectly. The other options list valid routes but with incorrect probabilities.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the Process and States**\n-   Initial state: $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$. This is the 3s state of the hydrogen atom.\n-   Final state: $|n, l, m\\rangle = |1, 0, 0\\rangle$. This is the 1s ground state.\n-   Transition mechanism: Two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n\n**2. Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules**\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole transition from a state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ to $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ are:\n-   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n-   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n-   $\\Delta n$ can be any non-zero integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State**\nLet the intermediate state be $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First transition: $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$**\n    -   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ to the initial state with $l=0$: $l_i - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l_i$ must be non-negative, we must have $l_i = 1$. The intermediate state must be a p-state.\n    -   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ to the initial state with $m=0$: $m_i - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are $m_i = -1, 0, 1$.\n    -   For a decay, we need $n_i < n=3$. So, $n_i$ could be 1 or 2.\n    -   However, the quantum number $l$ must be less than $n$ ($l \\le n-1$). Since $l_i=1$, we must have $n_i \\ge l_i+1 = 2$.\n    -   Combining these conditions ($n_i<3$ and $n_i\\ge 2$), the only possible principal quantum number for the intermediate state is $n_i = 2$.\n    -   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Second transition: $|2, 1, m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$**\n    -   Let's check if a transition from our determined intermediate states to the final state is allowed.\n    -   Initial (intermediate) state: $l_i=1$. Final state: $l_f=0$. So $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    -   Initial (intermediate) state: $m_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. Final state: $m_f=0$. So $\\Delta m = 0 - m_i = -m_i$. This is $0, \\mp 1$, which is allowed for all three values of $m_i$.\n    -   Initial (intermediate) state: $n_i=2$. Final state: $n_f=1$. So $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    -   Thus, all three states $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$ can decay to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n\nThe overall decay proceeds via one of these three routes (cascades):\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4. Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\nThe probability of the atom taking a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, since the second step is the only possible decay channel for the 2p state (it cannot decay to 2s, and higher states are not accessible via decay).\n\nThe transition rate for spontaneous emission is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n$A(i \\rightarrow f) \\propto |\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = e^2 (|\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2)$\n\nWe need to calculate this for the first transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_i\\rangle$. The radial part of the integral will be the same for all three values of $m_i$. We only need to compare the angular parts.\n\nA key principle of quantum mechanics (related to the Wigner-Eckart theorem and spherical symmetry) is that the decay of a spherically symmetric state (like any s-state, with $l=0$) into the different magnetic sublevels of a higher-$l$ state occurs with equal probability. The $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state has no preferred direction in space, so there is no reason for it to preferentially decay to one $m_i$ state over another.\n\nLet's verify this with a calculation. The transition rate to a specific final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ from an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ is given by the sum of squares of the matrix elements for the components of the dipole operator $\\mathbf{r}$.\nLet $I_{rad}$ be the common radial integral.\n-   **For the transition to $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$:** The selection rule for the $z$ operator ($z = r \\cos\\theta$) is $\\Delta m = 0$. The rules for $x$ and $y$ operators are $\\Delta m = \\pm 1$. So only the $\\langle z \\rangle$ matrix element is non-zero.\n    $A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\propto |\\langle 2,1,0 | z | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$. Calculation shows the angular part squared is $1/3$. So, $A \\propto |I_{rad}|^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n-   **For the transition to $|2, 1, \\pm 1\\rangle$:** Only the $\\langle x \\rangle$ and $\\langle y \\rangle$ matrix elements are non-zero.\n    $A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,\\pm 1\\rangle) \\propto |\\langle 2,1,\\pm 1 | x | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,\\pm 1 | y | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$. Calculation shows this sum is $|I_{rad}|^2 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6}) = |I_{rad}|^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSo, the transition rates for all three possible intermediate states are equal:\n$A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\nThe total decay rate from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is the sum of these three rates. The probability (or branching ratio) for decaying into any one specific intermediate state is:\n$P(\\text{via } |2,1,m_i\\rangle) = \\frac{A_m}{A_{-1} + A_0 + A_1} = \\frac{A_0}{A_0 + A_0 + A_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSo, each of the three possible cascade routes has a probability of $1/3$.\n\n**5. Match with the Options**\nWe now check which of the given options is consistent with our findings.\n-   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n-   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n-   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect. (Assuming the typo `\\rangle` means $|3,0,0\\rangle$).\n-   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This states a correct possible route with the correct probability.\n\nAlthough there are three possible routes, each with probability 1/3, option D is the only choice that presents a factually correct statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step decay (a cascade) of a hydrogen atom from the excited state |n=3, l=0, m=0> to the ground state |n=1, l=0, m=0> through an intermediate state. The decay occurs via two electric dipole transitions.\n\n2.  **Recall the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:**\n    For a transition from an initial state |n, l, m> to a final state |n', l', m'>, the following rules must be obeyed:\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number, Δn = n' - n, can be any integer. For decay, n' < n.\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl = l' - l, must be ±1.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = m' - m, must be 0 or ±1.\n\n3.  **Determine the possible intermediate states:**\n    Let the intermediate state be |n_int, l_int, m_int>.\n    *   **Step 1: |3,0,0> → |n_int, l_int, m_int>**\n        *   Initial state: l=0, m=0.\n        *   Applying the selection rule Δl = ±1, the intermediate state must have l_int = l + 1 = 1 (since l cannot be negative).\n        *   Applying the selection rule Δm = 0, ±1, the intermediate state can have m_int = m + Δm = 0 + (0, ±1), so m_int can be 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   The principal quantum number must decrease. The options suggest that the intermediate state has n_int = 2. This is a valid decay (3 → 2).\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,-1>.\n\n    *   **Step 2: |n_int, l_int, m_int> → |1,0,0>**\n        *   Intermediate state: l_int = 1, m_int ∈ {1, 0, -1}.\n        *   Final state: l_final = 0, m_final = 0.\n        *   Let's check if this transition is allowed for all possible intermediate states:\n            *   Δl = l_final - l_int = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n            *   Δm = m_final - m_int = 0 - m_int.\n                *   If m_int = 1, Δm = -1 (allowed).\n                *   If m_int = 0, Δm = 0 (allowed).\n                *   If m_int = -1, Δm = +1 (allowed).\n        *   So, all three routes proposed in options A, B, and C are physically possible according to the selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability of each transition route:**\n    The overall process is a cascade: |3,0,0> → |2,1,m_int> → |1,0,0>. The \"probability\" of a specific route refers to the branching ratio of the first step, i.e., the probability that the atom decays into that specific intermediate state. The second step is then a necessary consequence of being in that intermediate state.\n\n    We need to find the relative transition rates (and thus probabilities) for the first step:\n    *   Route A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1>\n    *   Route B: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0>\n    *   Route C: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>\n\n    The transition rate Γ for spontaneous emission from an initial state |i> to a final state |f> is given by Fermi's Golden Rule and is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the electric dipole operator **d** = e**r**:\n    $Γ_{i→f} ∝ |⟨f|e\\textbf{r}|i⟩|^2$\n    When averaged over all emission directions and polarizations, the rate is proportional to the sum of the squares of the matrix elements for the x, y, and z components:\n    $Γ_{i→f} ∝ |⟨f|ex|i⟩|^2 + |⟨f|ey|i⟩|^2 + |⟨f|ez|i⟩|^2$\n\n    A key insight comes from the symmetry of the initial state. The state |3,0,0> has l=0, meaning its wavefunction is spherically symmetric (the spherical harmonic Y_{0,0} is a constant). Because the initial state has no preferred direction in space, the probability of the atom emitting a photon and transitioning to a final state should be independent of the orientation of the final state's angular momentum. The quantum number 'm' represents the projection of the angular momentum onto the z-axis. Therefore, the probabilities of transitioning to the final states |2,1,1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,-1> must be equal.\n\n    Since these are the only three possible outcomes for the first decay step (to a state with l=1), their probabilities must sum to 1.\n    Let P(m_int) be the probability of transitioning to the state with magnetic quantum number m_int.\n    P(1) + P(0) + P(-1) = 1\n    Since P(1) = P(0) = P(-1) due to symmetry, we have:\n    3 * P(m_int) = 1\n    P(m_int) = 1/3\n\n    So, the probability for each of the three possible first steps is 1/3.\n    *   Probability of route via |2,1,1> is 1/3.\n    *   Probability of route via |2,1,0> is 1/3.\n    *   Probability of route via |2,1,-1> is 1/3.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and probability 1/4. The route is correct, but the calculated probability is 1/3. So, A is incorrect.\n    *   B) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and probability 1/3. The route is correct, and the calculated probability is 1/3. So, B is correct.\n    *   C) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and probability 1/4. The route is correct, but the calculated probability is 1/3. So, C is incorrect.\n    *   D) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and probability 2/3. The route is correct, but the calculated probability is 1/3. So, D is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability is B.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The calculation based on the spherical symmetry of the initial l=0 state is robust. A detailed calculation of the matrix elements confirms that the transition rates to the m=+1, m=0, and m=-1 sublevels of the l=1 state are indeed identical, leading to a 1/3 branching ratio for each.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a decay from the hydrogen atom state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. It explicitly states that this occurs via \"two dipole transition\", which implies a cascade decay involving an intermediate state. The process is:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{dipole transition 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{dipole transition 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State using Selection Rules:** We apply the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions to find the allowed intermediate state(s) $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    The selection rules are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   The principal quantum number $n$ must decrease for a decay process ($\\Delta n$ can be any integer).\n\n    *   **First Transition:** From $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   Since this is a decay, $n' < n_i = 3$. Also, for a given $n'$, we must have $l' < n'$. Since $l'=1$, the smallest possible $n'$ is 2. So, $n'$ must be 2.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** From an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed if $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which is true for all our possible intermediate states.\n        *   $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$. This is also an allowed decay.\n    *   **Conclusion on Routes:** All three intermediate states provide a valid decay path. The three possible routes are:\n        1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        The options A, B, and D all list valid routes. To distinguish between them, we must calculate the associated probabilities.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. In a cascade decay, this is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The atom in the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has three possible decay channels to the $n=2$ level. The probability of following a specific channel is the ratio of the partial decay rate for that channel to the total decay rate.\n\n    Branching Ratio for channel $m'$ = $\\frac{\\text{Rate}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m''=-1,0,1} \\text{Rate}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m''\\rangle)}$\n\n    The spontaneous emission rate (Einstein A coefficient) is proportional to the square of the dipole transition matrix element:\n    Rate $\\propto |\\langle n_f, l_f, m_f | e\\mathbf{r} | n_i, l_i, m_i \\rangle|^2$\n\n    We need to calculate this for the first transition: $|\\langle 2,1,m' | e\\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (it's an s-state, with $l=0$).\n    *   The final states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy in the non-relativistic H-atom model without external fields.\n    *   Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state and the interaction Hamiltonian (when averaged over all directions and polarizations of the emitted photon), the transition probability is independent of the final magnetic quantum number $m'$.\n\n    This can be shown formally using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element $\\langle n' l' m' | T_q^{(k)} | n l m \\rangle$ separates into a geometric part (a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient) and a physical part (the reduced matrix element), which is independent of the magnetic quantum numbers.\n    For a transition from $l=0$ to $l'=1$, the squared Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are identical for all three possible final states $m' = -1, 0, 1$.\n\n    Therefore, the transition rates to each of the three states are equal:\n    Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle$)\n\n    Let's call this rate $R$. The total rate is $R+R+R = 3R$.\n    The branching ratio for any specific channel $m'$ is:\n    Branching Ratio = $\\frac{R}{3R} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    Once the atom is in an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, it can only decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. So the probability of the second step is 1.\n    The overall probability for a given cascade path is thus the branching ratio of the first step, which is $1/3$.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our result.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is correct, but the probability is not.\n    *   C) Malformed option, but probability is $\\frac{2}{3}$. Incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is correct, but the probability is not.\n\n    Therefore, the only correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks for a possible decay path and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. The notation is $|n, l, m\\rangle$, representing the principal, orbital angular momentum, and magnetic quantum numbers, respectively.\n\n### **2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions**\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules, which dictate which transitions are \"allowed\". For a transition from an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ to a final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, the rules are:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0$ or $\\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n$, is not restricted by a selection rule, but for spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n### **3. Determine the Intermediate State(s)**\n\nThe decay is a two-step process:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nLet's find the quantum numbers of the allowed intermediate state(s) by applying the selection rules to both steps.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $|n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{int} - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l_{int} = 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{int} - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m_{int} = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n*   From the options provided, the intermediate principal quantum number is $n_{int}=2$. This is a valid decay since $2 < 3$.\n*   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Final state: $|n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n*   Let's check if the transitions from our possible intermediate states are allowed:\n    *   Intermediate state candidates: $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ where $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Applying the rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{int} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{int} = 0 - m_{int}$.\n            *   If $m_{int}=-1$, $\\Delta m = 1$. This is allowed.\n            *   If $m_{int}=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. This is allowed.\n            *   If $m_{int}=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   All three intermediate states lead to an allowed transition to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Thus, there are three possible decay routes:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### **4. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability corresponding to a given route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The atom starts in the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state and can decay into any of the three $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ states. We need to find the relative probability of these three initial decay channels.\n\n*   The transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the electric dipole operator, $\\mathbf{d}$.\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means its wave function is spherically symmetric. In such a case, there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   The electric dipole operator has components corresponding to the three possible changes in $m$:\n    *   $d_z \\propto r \\cos\\theta$ (for $\\Delta m = 0$)\n    *   $d_x \\pm i d_y \\propto r \\sin\\theta e^{\\pm i\\phi}$ (for $\\Delta m = \\pm 1$)\n*   Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state, the system has no preference for emitting a photon that changes $m$ by $-1, 0,$ or $+1$. Therefore, the transition probabilities to the three degenerate final states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$) must be equal.\n\n**Formal Argument (using Wigner-Eckart Theorem):**\nThe transition probability from $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is proportional to $|\\langle n'l'm'|\\mathbf{d}|nlm\\rangle|^2$. According to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, this matrix element can be separated into a physical part (the reduced matrix element) and a geometric part (the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient).\n\nFor the first transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n$P(m') \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m' | d_q | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,m' \\rangle|^2 \\cdot |\\langle 2,1 || d || 3,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nWhere $q=m'$. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$ are equal to 1 for all $m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$. The reduced matrix element $\\langle 2,1 || d || 3,0 \\rangle$ is independent of $m'$.\nTherefore, the probabilities are equal for all three transitions:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\nSince these are the only three possible intermediate states for the $n=2$ level, their probabilities must sum to 1. If there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability of each one is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   Prob (path via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$) = $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   Prob (path via $|2,1,0\\rangle$) = $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   Prob (path via $|2,1,1\\rangle$) = $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nThe second step of the cascade ($|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is guaranteed to happen once the atom is in the intermediate state, so the probability of the entire route is just the probability of the first step.\n\n### **5. Compare with Options**\n\nLet's review the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (**Correct** route and probability)\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only option that matches our analysis is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules:**\n    The problem describes a decay from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> (or |3,0,0>) to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0> (or |1,0,0>) via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n    The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n    *   Δn is not restricted but must change for emission/absorption. In this decay process, n decreases.\n\n2.  **Determine the First Transition Step:**\n    *   Initial state: |3,0,0>.\n    *   For the first transition, we apply the selection rules:\n        *   Δl = ±1: Since the initial l=0, the orbital quantum number of the intermediate state must be l'=1.\n        *   Δn < 0: The principal quantum number n must decrease. The lowest possible state with l=1 is n=2 (since l < n). So the intermediate state must have n'=2.\n        *   Δm = 0, ±1: Starting from m=0, the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate state, m', can be -1, 0, or +1.\n    *   Therefore, the first transition must be from |3,0,0> to one of the |2,1,m'> states, where m' can be -1, 0, or 1.\n    *   The problem implies the decay happens via the n=2 level as it is the only possible intermediate p-state (l=1) for a decay cascade from 3s.\n\n3.  **Determine the Second Transition Step:**\n    *   Intermediate state: |2,1,m'>.\n    *   Final state: |1,0,0>.\n    *   Let's check the selection rules for this step:\n        *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the Δl=±1 rule.\n        *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0 - m'. To satisfy the Δm=0, ±1 rule, m' must be -1, 0, or 1, which it is.\n    *   Thus, any of the intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1> can decay to the final state |1,0,0>. The transition route must be of the form |3,0,0> -> |2,1,m'> -> |1,0,0>. This confirms that the routes presented in options A, C, and D are all physically allowed.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    We now need to find the probability of a specific cascade occurring. This is a product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step (P₁):**\n        The initial state |3,0,0> is a 3s state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external polarizing fields, there is no preferred direction of decay. Therefore, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into each of the available final m' sublevels.\n        The possible final states for the first step are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. There are three such states.\n        The 3s state can only decay via E1 to a p-state. The only energetically accessible p-state is the 2p state (|2,1,m'>). Therefore, the total probability of decay from 3s to 2p is 1. This probability is split equally among the three m' sublevels.\n        So, the probability of decaying into any specific sublevel is:\n        P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = 1/3, for m' = -1, 0, 1.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step (P₂):**\n        The intermediate state is |2,1,m'> (a 2p state). It needs to decay to a lower energy state. According to E1 selection rules (Δl=±1), it can decay to an s-state (l=0) or a d-state (l=2). Since n must be less than 2, the only available state is the n=1 state, which requires l=0 (1s state, |1,0,0>). A 1d state does not exist.\n        Therefore, the 2p state has only one possible E1 decay channel: the 1s state.\n        This means that once the atom is in any |2,1,m'> state, it will decay to |1,0,0> with a probability of 1.\n        P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) = 1, for m' = -1, 0, 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability of a specific cascade:**\n        The total probability for a specific route is P_total = P₁ * P₂.\n        Let's calculate this for the route given in option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>.\n        P_total = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) * P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>)\n        P_total = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{3}. This matches our calculation. The route is valid and the probability is correct.\n    *   B) Route is garbled, but the probability of 2/3 is incorrect for a single cascade path.\n    *   C) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}. The route is valid, but the calculated probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n    *   D) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}. The route is valid, but the calculated probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial and final states and the process:**\n    *   Initial state: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This corresponds to the 3s orbital of the hydrogen atom.\n    *   Final state: $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. This is the ground state, the 1s orbital.\n    *   Process: The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|int\\rangle$. The path is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |int\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:**\n    The selection rules for quantum numbers $(n, l, m)$ in an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer change (for decay, $\\Delta n < 0$).\n\n3.  **Determine the possible intermediate state(s):**\n    *   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |int\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state has $l=0$. According to the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n        *   Since it is a decay, the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n        *   For a valid hydrogen atom state, we must have $l' < n'$. Since $l'=1$, the smallest possible value for $n'$ is 2. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n        *   A transition to $n'=1$ is not possible for the first step, because if $n'=1$, then $l'$ must be 0. This would violate the $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   For the magnetic quantum number, the initial state has $m=0$. The selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ means that $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, so $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n        *   Combining these findings, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. These correspond to the 2p subshell.\n\n    *   **Second transition: $|int\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state for this step has $l'=1$ and the final state has $l_f=0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is an allowed transition.\n        *   The final state has $m_f=0$. Let's check the $\\Delta m$ rule for each possible intermediate state:\n            *   From $|2,1,1\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - 1 = -1$. Allowed.\n            *   From $|2,1,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$. Allowed.\n            *   From $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$. Allowed.\n        *   Therefore, all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. In fact, the 2p state's only allowed dipole decay channel is to the 1s state.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. Since the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ must proceed through one of the three $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the probability of a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the probability of populating a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\n    The transition rate from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment: $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    We need to compare the rates of transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay process cannot have a preferred orientation for the resulting angular momentum of the atom. This physical intuition implies that the three final states $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, which are distinguished only by their orientation in space (the value of $m'$), must be populated with equal probability.\n\n    A more formal argument using the Wigner-Eckart theorem shows that the transition probability from an unpolarized $l=0$ state to an $l'=1$ state is independent of the final magnetic quantum number $m'$. The matrix elements for these transitions are proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$, which are all equal to 1. Thus, the transition rates are equal:\n    $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle)$.\n\n    Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the intermediate state, the probability for any single one is $1/3$.\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it will decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state with probability 1 (since this is the only available dipole decay channel).\n    Therefore, the probability of the entire cascade following a specific route is simply the probability of the first step. For the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, the probability is $1/3$.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (**Correct route and probability**)\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0>. This decay occurs via two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means there must be an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Recall Dipole Transition Selection Rules:** For an electric dipole transition between states |n,l,m> and |n',l',m'>, the following selection rules must be obeyed:\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number, Δn = n' - n, can be any integer.\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl = l' - l, must be ±1.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = m' - m, must be 0 or ±1.\n\n3.  **Determine Possible Intermediate States (First Transition):**\n    *   Initial state: |3,0,0> (n=3, l=0, m=0).\n    *   For the first E1 transition, l must change by ±1. Since l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n    *   The principal quantum number n must decrease for a decay. A common intermediate state would be n'=2. So the intermediate state is of the form |2,1,m'>.\n    *   For the magnetic quantum number m, the change Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = m' must be 0, ±1.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are:\n        *   |2,1,0> (for Δm=0)\n        *   |2,1,1> (for Δm=+1)\n        *   |2,1,-1> (for Δm=-1)\n\n4.  **Verify the Second Transition:**\n    *   From each possible intermediate state |2,1,m'>, we check if a transition to the final state |1,0,0> is allowed.\n    *   Final state: |1,0,0> (n=1, l=0, m=0).\n    *   Consider the transition from |2,1,m'> to |1,0,0>:\n        *   Δn = 1-2 = -1 (allowed).\n        *   Δl = 0-1 = -1 (allowed).\n        *   Δm = 0-m'. For this to be allowed, m' must be 0 or ±1. All three of our possible intermediate states satisfy this.\n    *   So, all three routes are possible:\n        *   Route 1: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n        *   Route 2: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n        *   Route 3: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios) for Each Route:**\n    The probability of a particular cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, assuming the intermediate state has only one significant decay channel (which is the case here, decaying to |1,0,0>).\n    The branching ratio B(i→f) is the ratio of the rate of a specific transition Γ(i→f) to the total decay rate from the initial state, Γ_tot(i).\n    B(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) / Γ_total\n\n    The total decay rate from |3,0,0> is the sum of the rates to the three possible intermediate states:\n    Γ_total = Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>) + Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>) + Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>)\n\n    The spontaneous emission rate Γ is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, |<f|**r**|i>|².\n    Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) ∝ |<2,1,m'| **r** |3,0,0>|²\n\n    We need to calculate the relative values of these matrix elements. The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (l=0). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay must be isotropic, meaning the probability of populating each of the m' sublevels of the l'=1 state must be equal.\n\n    Let's verify this with a calculation. The rate is proportional to:\n    *   For m'=0: |<2,1,0|z|3,0,0>|²\n    *   For m'=1: |<2,1,1|x|3,0,0>|² + |<2,1,1|y|3,0,0>|²\n    *   For m'=-1: |<2,1,-1|x|3,0,0>|² + |<2,1,-1|y|3,0,0>|²\n\n    The calculation using spherical harmonics (as detailed in the thought process) shows that these three quantities are equal. The radial part of the integral is common to all three, and the angular part gives:\n    *   Rate(→ m'=0) ∝ (1/3) × |Radial Integral|²\n    *   Rate(→ m'=1) ∝ (1/6 + 1/6) × |Radial Integral|² = (1/3) × |Radial Integral|²\n    *   Rate(→ m'=-1) ∝ (1/6 + 1/6) × |Radial Integral|² = (1/3) × |Radial Integral|²\n\n    Since the rates are equal, let's call the rate for each channel Γ_0.\n    Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>) = Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>) = Γ_0\n    The total rate is Γ_total = Γ_0 + Γ_0 + Γ_0 = 3Γ_0.\n\n    The branching ratio for any specific route, say via |2,1,0>, is:\n    B = Γ_0 / (3Γ_0) = 1/3.\n\n    Thus, each of the three possible routes has a probability of 1/3.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4. Incorrect probability.\n    *   B) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 1/3. This matches our result.\n    *   C) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 2/3. Incorrect probability.\n    *   D) |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4. Incorrect probability.\n\n    The only correct option is B.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition Process:**\n    The problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |3,0,0> to the final state |1,0,0> via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it |n', l', m'>. The decay cascade looks like this:\n    |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules:**\n    Electric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m:\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n    *   Δn is not restricted (but for a decay, energy must decrease, so n must decrease).\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **First Transition:** |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩\n        *   The initial state has l=0. To satisfy Δl=±1, the intermediate state must have l'=1.\n        *   The initial state has m=0. To satisfy Δm=0, ±1, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   For a decay process, the energy of the atom must decrease. The energy of a state |n,l,m> depends only on n (E_n = -E_R/n², where E_R is the Rydberg energy). So, we need E_n' < E₃, which implies n' < 3.\n        *   Since l'=1, the principal quantum number n' must be at least 2 (as for a given n, l can range from 0 to n-1).\n        *   Combining n'<3 and n'≥2, the only possible value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is n'=2.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n        *   The initial state has l'=1 and the final state has l=0. This satisfies Δl = -1, which is an allowed E1 transition.\n        *   The final state has m=0. The possible transitions from the intermediate m' states are:\n            *   m'= -1 → m=0 (Δm = +1, allowed)\n            *   m'= 0 → m=0 (Δm = 0, allowed)\n            *   m'= 1 → m=0 (Δm = -1, allowed)\n        *   All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0⟩.\n\n4.  **Determine the Transition Routes and Probabilities:**\n    We have established three possible decay routes, distinguished by the magnetic quantum number m' of the intermediate |2,1,m'⟩ state:\n    *   Route 1: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n    *   Route 2: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n    *   Route 3: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n    The question asks for the probability of a given route. This refers to the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the probability that the decay from |3,0,0> proceeds to a specific |2,1,m'> state.\n\n    The transition rate Γ from an initial state |i⟩ to a final state |f⟩ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element: Γ ∝ |⟨f| **d** |i⟩|², where **d** is the electric dipole operator.\n\n    The initial state |3,0,0> has l=0, which means its wavefunction is spherically symmetric. In spontaneous decay into an isotropic vacuum, there is no preferred direction. The three intermediate states |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩ are degenerate in energy and correspond to different orientations of the orbital angular momentum. Due to the rotational symmetry of the situation, the decay rates to these three states must be equal.\n\n    A more formal argument using the Wigner-Eckart theorem confirms this: the transition rate from an |n,l,m⟩ state to an |n',l',m'⟩ state depends on the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. For a transition from any |n,0,0⟩ state to an |n',1,m'⟩ state, the relevant squared Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are all equal to 1. Since the rest of the terms in the rate calculation (radial integral, frequency) are independent of m', the transition rates are identical:\n    Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)\n\n    Since these are the only three possible outcomes for the first decay step, their probabilities must sum to 1. As the rates are equal, their probabilities must be equal:\n    P(-1) = P(0) = P(1)\n    P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1\n    3 * P(0) = 1  => P(0) = 1/3\n\n    So, the probability for the atom to decay into any specific m' intermediate state is 1/3. The probability of the second step (|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) is 1, as this is the only E1 decay channel available to the |2p⟩ state. Therefore, the overall probability for any of the three complete routes is 1/3.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation.\n    *   B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is correct, but the probability is wrong.\n    *   C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is correct, but the probability is wrong. (Assuming typo in the option's initial state).\n    *   D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is correct, but the probability is wrong.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a possible route and its corresponding probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThis problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the state |n=3, l=0, m=0> to the ground state |n=1, l=0, m=0> through a two-step process, where each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. We need to determine the correct intermediate state and the probability (branching ratio) of that specific decay path.\n\n### 1. Electric Dipole (E1) Transition Selection Rules\nFor a transition to be allowed under the E1 approximation, the quantum numbers must change according to these rules:\n- **Principal quantum number (n):** Δn = any integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), n must decrease.\n- **Orbital angular momentum quantum number (l):** Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1.\n- **Magnetic quantum number (m):** Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Decay Path\nThe decay proceeds in two steps:\n|3,0,0>  →  |n',l',m'>  →  |1,0,0>\n\n**Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0> to the intermediate state |n',l',m'>**\n- **Initial state:** |i> = |3,0,0> (n=3, l=0, m=0).\n- **Applying Δl = ±1:** The intermediate state must have l' = l ± 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 (since l cannot be negative).\n- **Applying Δm = 0, ±1:** The intermediate state must have m' = m + Δm = 0 + Δm, so m' can be 0, 1, or -1.\n- **Applying Δn < 0:** The intermediate state must have n' < 3.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state |n',l',m'> to |1,0,0>**\n- **Final state:** |f> = |1,0,0> (n=1, l=0, m=0).\n- **Applying Δl = ±1:** The intermediate state must have l' = l_final ± 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. This is consistent with the result from Step 1.\n- **Applying Δn < 0:** The intermediate state must have n' > n_final = 1.\n\n**Combining the conditions for the intermediate state |n',l',m'>:**\n- From Step 1, n' < 3.\n- From Step 2, n' > 1.\n- The only integer n' that satisfies 1 < n' < 3 is n'=2.\n- We also know that l'=1 and m' can be -1, 0, or 1.\n\nTherefore, there are three possible intermediate states, and consequently, three possible decay routes:\n1.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n2.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n3.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n\nAll routes listed in the options are valid based on the selection rules. The next step is to determine the probability.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe overall probability of a specific cascade is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>. The transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element |<n',l',m'| **r** |n,l,m>|².\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0> is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric (l=0). When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, it has an equal probability of transitioning to each of the available magnetic sublevels (m') of the final state, as there is no preferred direction in space.\nThe available final states for the first step are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. Since there are three equally probable destination states, the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them.\n\n- Probability(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n- Probability(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n- Probability(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n\nThe python code in the thinking process confirms this result using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which formally describe the coupling of angular momenta. The code shows that the probability for each of the three channels is 1/3.\n\nSince the intermediate 2p states (|2,1,m'>) can only decay to the 1s state (|1,0,0>) via an E1 transition, the probability of the second step in the cascade is 1 once the atom reaches the intermediate state. Thus, the total probability for the cascade is simply the probability of the first step.\n\n### 4.

(Incorrect probability)\nD) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and Probability = 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only correct option is B.\n\nThe transition route is |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and the corresponding probability is \\frac{1}{3}.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition Path**\n    The problem describes a decay from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩ (the 3s state) to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0⟩ (the 1s state) through a two-step process involving electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state:\n    |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\n    The selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n    *   Δn = any integer (principal quantum number can change by any amount).\n    *   Δl = ±1 (orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by 1).\n    *   Δm = 0, ±1 (magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or 1).\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State |n', l', m'⟩**\n    *   **First transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩**\n        *   The initial state has l=0. To satisfy Δl = ±1, the intermediate state must have l'=1.\n        *   The decay process means energy is released, so the principal quantum number must decrease, i.e., n' < 3.\n        *   The combination n'=1, l'=1 is not possible, as for a given n, l must be less than n (l ≤ n-1).\n        *   Therefore, the only possible value for n' is 2. The intermediate state must have n'=2 and l'=1. This is the 2p state.\n        *   The initial state has m=0. To satisfy Δm = 0, ±1, the magnetic quantum number m' of the intermediate state can be m' = 0-1 = -1, m' = 0+0 = 0, or m' = 0+1 = 1.\n        *   So, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n    *   **Second transition: |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n        *   Let's verify that a transition from the |2,1,m'⟩ states to the final state |1,0,0⟩ is allowed.\n        *   The change in l is from l'=1 to l_final=0, so Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   The change in m depends on m'.\n            *   For |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, Δm = 0 - 0 = 0. Allowed.\n            *   For |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, Δm = 0 - 1 = -1. Allowed.\n            *   For |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, Δm = 0 - (-1) = +1. Allowed.\n        *   All three cascade routes are physically possible. The options provided in the question confirm this, listing these specific routes.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios for each step. For the route passing through the intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩, the probability is:\n    P(route via m') = BR(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩) × BR(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the second step (BR₂):** From any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, the only allowed E1 decay is to the |1,0,0⟩ state. There are no other lower-energy states to which it can decay via an E1 transition. Thus, the probability of this step occurring, given the atom is in the |2,1,m'⟩ state, is 1. So, BR(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = 1 for all m'.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the first step (BR₁):** The probability of the route is now simplified to the branching ratio of the first step:\n    P(route via m') = BR(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩)\n\n    The branching ratio for a specific channel is the decay rate for that channel divided by the total decay rate of the initial state.\n    BR(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩) / Γ_total(|3,0,0⟩)\n\n    The total decay rate is the sum of the rates to all possible final states:\n    Γ_total(|3,0,0⟩) = Γ(→ |2,1,-1⟩) + Γ(→ |2,1,0⟩) + Γ(→ |2,1,1⟩)\n\n    The transition rate Γ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, |⟨f|**d**|i⟩|². The key physical principle here is the isotropy of space. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (l=0). When such a state undergoes spontaneous emission into the vacuum (which is also isotropic, having no preferred direction), the probability of transitioning to any of the degenerate m' sub-levels of the final p-state is equal. This is a direct consequence of the Wigner-Eckart theorem.\n\n    Therefore, the transition rates are equal:\n    Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)\n\n    Let's call this rate G. Then the total rate is Γ_total = G + G + G = 3G.\n    The branching ratio for any specific route (e.g., via m'=0) is:\n    BR(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = G / (3G) = 1/3.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion**\n    The probability for each of the three possible routes is 1/3.\n    *   P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩) = 1/3\n    *   P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩) = 1/3\n    *   P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩) = 1/3\n\n    Now we compare this result with the given options:\n    A) ... and 1/4 (Incorrect)\n    B) ... |2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3 (Correct)\n    C) ... and 2/3 (Incorrect)\n    D) ... and 1/4 (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct option is the one that lists a valid route with the calculated probability of 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\nThe problem asks about the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n,l,m> = |3,0,0> (the 3s state) to the final state |1,0,0> (the 1s state). This decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. We need to identify a valid pathway and calculate its probability relative to all other possible two-dipole transition pathways.\n\n### 2. Applying Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n*   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n*   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n*   Δn can be any integer.\n\nA direct transition from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> is forbidden by the E1 selection rules because Δl = 0 - 0 = 0. Therefore, the process must go through an intermediate state, let's call it |n',l',m'>.\n\n### 3. Identifying the Intermediate State(s)\n\n#### First Transition: |3,0,0> → |n',l',m'>\n*   Initial state: n=3, l=0, m=0.\n*   Applying Δl = ±1: Since l=0, l' must be 1.\n*   Applying Δm = 0, ±1: Since m=0, m' can be 0, +1, or -1.\n*   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease, so n' < 3. The most probable intermediate state is the energetically lowest possible one, which is n'=2 (the options also point to n'=2).\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. These correspond to the three sublevels of the 2p orbital.\n\n#### Second Transition: |n',l',m'> → |1,0,0>\nLet's check if transitions from our possible intermediate states to the final state are allowed.\n*   Initial state: |2,1,m'> (with m' = -1, 0, or 1).\n*   Final state: |1,0,0>.\n*   Applying Δl = ±1: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n*   Applying Δm = 0, ±1: Δm = 0 - m'. This is allowed for m' = -1, 0, or 1.\n*   So, all three intermediate 2p states can decay to the 1s final state.\n\nThis confirms there are three possible routes for the cascade decay:\n1.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n2.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n3.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probabilities of the Routes\nThe probability of a specific route depends on the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the probability of the |3,0,0> state decaying into a specific |2,1,m'> sublevel.\n\nThe transition rate from an initial state `i` to a final state `f` is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, summed over all possible polarizations of the emitted photon:\nRate(i→f) ∝ |⟨f|**d**|i⟩|² = |⟨f|x|i⟩|² + |⟨f|y|i⟩|² + |⟨f|z|i⟩|²\n\nWe need to calculate the relative rates for the decay from |3,0,0> to each of the three |2,1,m'> states.\n\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state |3,0,0> has l=0, which means it is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay from this symmetric state into the three sublevels (m'=-1, 0, 1), which are only distinguished by their orientation in space, must occur with equal probability. This implies that each route has a probability of 1/3.\n\n*   **Explicit Calculation (using the Wigner-Eckart Theorem):**\n    The rate of transition from an initial state |nlm⟩ to a final state |n'l'm'⟩ is determined by the matrix element. The Wigner-Eckart theorem separates the matrix element's dependence on geometry (the m quantum numbers) from its overall strength (the reduced matrix element).\n\n    The rate for the transition |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'> is proportional to a constant C for each of the three possible values of m' (-1, 0, 1). Let the rate for each transition be R.\n    *   Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = R\n    *   Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>)  = R\n    *   Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>)  = R\n\n    The total rate of decay from |3,0,0> to any of the |2,1,m'> states is the sum:\n    Total Rate = R + R + R = 3R.\n\n    The probability (or branching ratio) for the system to take a specific path is the rate for that path divided by the total rate. For example, for the path through the m'=0 intermediate state:\n    Probability(m'=0 route) = Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) / Total Rate = R / (3R) = 1/3.\n\n    Similarly, the probability for the routes via m'=-1 and m'=1 are also 1/3.\n\n    For the second step of the decay (|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>), it is the only E1-allowed decay channel for the 2p state. Therefore, its probability is 1 (or the branching ratio is 100%).\n\n    The overall probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the probability of the first step.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe three possible routes via the intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> are all allowed and are equally probable, each with a probability of 1/3.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n*   C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3 (Correct route and probability)\n*   D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3 (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Process\nThe problem describes a two-step electric dipole (E1) transition for a hydrogen atom, cascading from the initial state |n,l,m> = |3,0,0> (also known as the 3s state) to the final state |1,0,0> (the 1s ground state) through an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Determine the Intermediate State using Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   **Δl = ±1**\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**\n\n**First transition: |3,0,0> → |n',l',m'>**\n*   The initial state has l=0. To satisfy Δl=±1, the intermediate state must have **l'=1**.\n*   The initial state has m=0. To satisfy Δm=0, ±1, the intermediate state can have **m' = 0, +1, or -1**.\n*   The problem implies a cascade decay, so the principal quantum number n must decrease. The only allowed n between 3 and 1 is **n'=2**.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are the sublevels of the 2p orbital: **|2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>**.\n\n**Second transition: |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\n*   The initial state for this step has l'=1. The final state has l''=0. The change is **Δl = 0 - 1 = -1**, which satisfies the selection rule.\n*   For the change in magnetic quantum number, Δm = m'' - m' = 0 - m'. This must be 0, ±1.\n    *   If m' = 0, Δm = 0 (allowed).\n    *   If m' = +1, Δm = -1 (allowed).\n    *   If m' = -1, Δm = +1 (allowed).\n*   All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0>.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of Each Transition Route\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio for that cascade path compared to all other possible two-step cascade paths to the ground state. The probability of a given cascade path through an intermediate state |m'> is proportional to the product of the transition rates (or strengths) for each step:\n\nProbability(route via m') ∝ Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) × Rate(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>)\n\nThe relative rates for these transitions can be determined using the Hönl-London factors, which give the relative strengths of spectral lines originating from the same initial level or ending on the same level. We will use the formulas from a standard text like Bethe and Salpeter's \"Quantum Mechanics of One- and Two-Electron Atoms\". The transition rate is proportional to a factor 'A' given by these formulas.\n\n**Step 1: Relative rates for |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>**\nThis is a transition from l=0, m=0 to l'=l+1=1. The formulas for the strength A(l,m → l+1,m') are:\n*   A(l,m → l+1, m-1) ∝ (l-m+1)(l-m+2)\n*   A(l,m → l+1, m)   ∝ 4(l-m+1)(l+m+1)\n*   A(l,m → l+1, m+1) ∝ (l+m+1)(l+m+2)\n\nApplying this for l=0, m=0:\n*   Rate(m'=-1): A(0,0 → 1,-1) ∝ (0-0+1)(0-0+2) = 2\n*   Rate(m'=0):   A(0,0 → 1,0)   ∝ 4(0-0+1)(0+0+1) = 4\n*   Rate(m'=+1): A(0,0 → 1,+1) ∝ (0+0+1)(0+0+2) = 2\n\nThe relative rates for populating the intermediate states m'=-1, 0, +1 are in the ratio **2 : 4 : 2**, or **1 : 2 : 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Relative rates for |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\nThis is a transition from an initial state with l=1 to a final state with l''=l-1=0 and m''=0. We need the rates from each m' sublevel to the final state. The formulas for A(l,m → l-1,m'') are:\n*   A(l,m → l-1, m-1) ∝ (l+m)(l+m-1)\n*   A(l,m → l-1, m)   ∝ 4(l+m)(l-m)\n*   A(l,m → l-1, m+1) ∝ (l-m)(l-m-1)\n\nApplying this for l=1, with various initial m values, all ending in m''=0:\n*   **From m'=-1:** We need the transition m→m+1 to get to m''=0. A(1,-1 → 0,0) ∝ (l-m)(l-m-1) = (1-(-1))(1-(-1)-1) = (2)(1) = 2.\n*   **From m'=0:** We need the transition m→m. A(1,0 → 0,0) ∝ 4(l+m)(l-m) = 4(1+0)(1-0) = 4.\n*   **From m'=+1:** We need the transition m→m-1. A(1,1 → 0,0) ∝ (l+m)(l+m-1) = (1+1)(1+1-1) = (2)(1) = 2.\n\nThe relative rates for the second decay step, from the states m'=-1, 0, +1, are also in the ratio **2 : 4 : 2**, or **1 : 2 : 1**.\n\n### 4. Combine Probabilities and Normalize\nNow we find the unnormalized probability for each full cascade route by multiplying the relative strengths from each step.\n\n*   **Route via |2,1,-1>:** Prob ∝ (Rate 1) × (Rate 2) = 1 × 1 = 1\n*   **Route via |2,1,0>:**  Prob ∝ (Rate 1) × (Rate 2) = 2 × 2 = 4\n*   **Route via |2,1,1>:**   Prob ∝ (Rate 1) × (Rate 2) = 1 × 1 = 1\n\nThe total relative probability for all three routes is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\nNow we normalize to find the final probabilities:\n*   P(Route via m'=-1) = 1/6\n*   P(Route via m'=0)  = 4/6 = **2/3**\n*   P(Route via m'=+1) = 1/6\n\n### 5. Final Answer\nWe compare these results with the given options:\n*   A) Route through |2,1,-1> with probability 1/4. (Our result is 1/6)\n*   B) Route through |2,1,0> with probability 2/3. (Our result is 2/3)\n*   C) Route through |2,1,0> with probability 1/3. (Our result is 2/3)\n*   D) Route through |2,1,1> with probability 1/4. (Our result is 1/6)\n\nThe calculation matches option B.\n\nThe transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ has a corresponding probability of $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes a two-step decay process from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩ via an intermediate state. The transitions are electric dipole transitions, which are governed by specific selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m:\n    *   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly 1.\n    *   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or 1.\n    *   **Δn is unrestricted**: The principal quantum number can change by any integer value, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so n must decrease.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State(s)**\n    Let the intermediate state be |n', l', m'⟩.\n    *   **First transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩**\n        *   Applying the Δl rule: l' - l = l' - 0 = ±1. So, the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n        *   For a decay, n' < n. So, n' must be less than 3. The possible values are n'=2 or n'=1.\n        *   If n'=1, then l' would have to be 0 (since for a given n, l can range from 0 to n-1). This would violate the Δl=±1 rule. Therefore, the intermediate state must have **n' = 2**.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, ±1. So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are **m' = 0, +1, or -1**.\n        *   Combining these, the possible intermediate states are the three degenerate 2p states: |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n    *   **Second transition: |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n        *   Let's check if a transition from our identified intermediate states |2,1,m'⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩ is allowed.\n        *   Applying the Δl rule: l_final - l' = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies Δl=±1.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: m_final - m' = 0 - m'. Since m' can be 0, +1, or -1, Δm can be 0, -1, or +1, respectively. All these are allowed.\n        *   Therefore, all three routes are physically possible:\n            1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n            2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n            3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n    The question asks for \"The transition route and the corresponding probability\". This refers to the branching ratio for a specific decay channel.\n    *   The initial state is |3,0,0⟩ (the 3s state). This state is spherically symmetric (l=0).\n    *   When a spherically symmetric state decays, the transition probabilities to each of the possible final magnetic sub-levels are equal. This is a consequence of the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which separates the geometry (m-dependence) from the dynamics.\n    *   In this case, the atom in the |3,0,0⟩ state can decay to any of the three |2,1,m'⟩ states. Since there is no preferred direction in the initial state, the probabilities for these three decay channels must be equal.\n    *   Total probability of decaying from |3,0,0⟩ to any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states is 1 (as this is the only allowed decay path). Since the three channels are equally likely, the probability for each is:\n        *   P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = 1/3\n        *   P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩) = 1/3\n        *   P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = 1/3\n    *   The second step of the decay is from the intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. The 2p state (|2,1,m'⟩) can only decay to the 1s state (|1,0,0⟩) via an electric dipole transition. Thus, once the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, it will decay to |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1.\n    *   The probability of a complete transition route is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route via |2,1,0⟩:\n        P(Route) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\n        P(Route) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options**\n    *   **A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3**: The route is valid, and the calculated probability is correct.\n    *   **B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4**: The route is valid, but the probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n    *   **C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n    *   **D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4**: The route is valid, but the probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that presents a valid route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\n\nThe problem asks about the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n, l, m> = |3, 0, 0> (the 3s state) to the final state |1, 0, 0> (the 1s ground state). The decay occurs via **two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions**. This means the atom decays from the initial state to an intermediate state, and then from that intermediate state to the final state. Each of these two steps involves the emission of one photon.\n\n### 2. Applying Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m:\n*   **Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly one unit.\n*   **Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or ±1. This corresponds to the polarization of the emitted photon (Δm = 0 for linear polarization along the z-axis, Δm = ±1 for circular polarization in the x-y plane).\n*   **Δn = n_final - n_initial**: The principal quantum number can change by any integer value, but for a decay (emission), n must decrease (Δn < 0).\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State\n\nLet the intermediate state be |n', l', m'>.\n\n*   **First transition: |3, 0, 0> → |n', l', m'>**\n    *   Applying the Δl = ±1 rule to the initial state l=0: l' must be 0 ± 1, so **l' = 1**. The intermediate state must be a p-orbital.\n    *   Applying the Δm = 0, ±1 rule to the initial state m=0: m' can be 0+0, 0+1, or 0-1. So, **m' can be 0, 1, or -1**.\n    *   For the principal quantum number n', since this is a decay, n' < 3. The most probable transition is to the lowest possible energy level that satisfies the other rules. The n=2 level is lower in energy than n=3. The options provided in the question all use n'=2 as the intermediate state, which is the intermediate step of the famous Balmer-alpha transition (3s → 2p). So, the intermediate state is of the form **|2, 1, m'>**.\n\n*   **Second transition: |n', l', m'> = |2, 1, m'> → |1, 0, 0>**\n    *   Let's check if this is allowed.\n    *   Applying the Δl = ±1 rule: The transition is from l'=1 to l_final=0. So Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is a valid transition.\n    *   Applying the Δm = 0, ±1 rule: The transition is from m' to m_final=0. So Δm = 0 - m'. This must be 0, ±1. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate m' values (0, 1, -1).\n\n### 4. Identifying Possible Transition Routes\n\nBased on the selection rules, there are three possible cascade routes from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> through the n=2 manifold:\n1.  `|3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>`\n2.  `|3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>`\n3.  `|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>`\n\nAll options A, B, C, and D present one of these valid routes. To find the correct answer, we must calculate the probability of each route.\n\n### 5. Calculating the \"Probability\" (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe \"probability\" in this context refers to the branching ratio: for all atoms starting in |3,0,0> that decay via this two-step cascade, what fraction will take a specific path?\n\n*   **Probability of the first step: |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>**\n    *   The initial state |3,0,0> is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred direction in space.\n    *   Due to this rotational symmetry, there is no preference for emitting a photon with Δm=+1, Δm=0, or Δm=-1. Therefore, the transitions to the three possible m' sublevels (|2,1,1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,-1>) are equally probable.\n    *   The decay from the 3s state to the 2p manifold is the dominant decay channel for the 3s state.

(**Correct** route and probability)\n\nTherefore, option D correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step decay process of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|\\psi_i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|\\psi_f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means there must be an intermediate state, $|\\psi_{int}\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Determine the intermediate state using selection rules:** The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any non-zero integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n    *   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n        *   $l_{initial} = 0$. So, $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n        *   $m_{initial} = 0$. So, $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, which means $m'$ can be $0, 1, -1$.\n        *   $n_{initial} = 3$. For decay, $n' < 3$. So $n'$ can be 1 or 2.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   $l_{final} = 0$. We must have had $l' = 1$ for this transition to be allowed ($\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$). This is consistent with the first transition.\n        *   $m_{final} = 0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$, which implies $m'$ can be $0, 1, -1$. This is also consistent.\n        *   $n_{final} = 1$. For decay, $n' > 1$.\n\n    *   **Combining the conditions:** The intermediate state must have $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$, and $1 < n' < 3$. This uniquely determines $n'=2$. So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. The decay must proceed through one of these three paths:\n        *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n3.  **Calculate the probability for each path:** The question asks for \"the corresponding probability\". In the context of multiple decay paths, this refers to the branching ratio: the probability of the decay occurring via a specific path, relative to all other possible paths for this process.\n\n    *   The probability of a specific path is determined by the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n    *   The probability of path $m'$ is $P(m') = BR(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m') \\times BR(2,1,m' \\to 1,0,0)$.\n\n    *   **Branching ratio for the second step:** Consider the state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. What are its possible E1 decay channels? The final state must have $l_{final} = 0$ or $l_{final} = 2$.\n        *   If $l_{final}=2$, then $n_{final} \\geq l_{final}+1=3$. Since decay requires $n_{final} < n'=2$, this is not possible.\n        *   If $l_{final}=0$, then $n_{final} \\geq l_{final}+1=1$. Decay requires $n_{final} < n'=2$, so the only possible final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Therefore, the decay from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the only possible E1 decay channel. This means the branching ratio for the second step is 1, regardless of $m'$.\n        *   $BR(2,1,m' \\to 1,0,0) = 1$ for $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n\n    *   **Branching ratio for the first step:** The probability of taking a specific path is now reduced to the branching ratio of the first step: $P(m') = BR(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$. The branching ratio is the ratio of the decay rate to the specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   $BR(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')}{\\sum_{m''=-1}^{1} \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m'')}$\n        *   The decay rate $\\Gamma(i \\to f)$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f |e\\mathbf{r}| i \\rangle|^2$.\n        *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the different magnetic substates $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ must be equally probable. The atom has an equal chance of emitting a photon with polarization corresponding to $\\Delta m = +1$, $\\Delta m = -1$, or $\\Delta m = 0$.\n        *   This can be confirmed by explicit calculation using the Wigner-Eckart theorem or by direct calculation of the matrix elements $\\langle 2,1,m'|x|3,0,0 \\rangle$, $\\langle 2,1,m'|y|3,0,0 \\rangle$, and $\\langle 2,1,m'|z|3,0,0 \\rangle$. The transition strength, summed over polarizations, is $|\\langle 2,1,m'|e\\mathbf{r}|3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$, which is found to be independent of $m'$.\n        *   Thus, $\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,1) = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,0) = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,-1)$.\n\n    *   **Final Probability:** Since the three possible paths of the first step have equal rates, their branching ratios are equal. As there are three paths, each must have a probability of $1/3$.\n        *   $BR(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m') = 1/3$ for each $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n        *   The overall probability for the decay to proceed via the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is $P(m') = (1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\n4.  **Match with options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect. Our calculation gives $1/3$.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect. Our calculation gives $1/3$.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect. Our calculation gives $1/3$.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. Both the transition route and the calculated probability match.\n\nThe transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition Process:**\n    The problem describes a decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ occurring via a cascade of two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state, and the decay happens in two steps:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Apply E1 Selection Rules for the First Transition:**\n    The selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   $\\Delta n = n' - n$ can be any integer.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n    For the first step, the initial state is $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l' - 0 = \\pm 1$, which means the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, so the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. In a hydrogen atom, we must have $l' < n'$. Since $l'=1$, we need $n' \\ge 2$. Combining these conditions, the only possible value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$.\n\n    Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply E1 Selection Rules for the Second Transition:**\n    The second step is the transition from an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. This condition must be satisfied.\n        *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$ (allowed).\n        *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$ (allowed).\n        *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = +1$ (allowed).\n    So, all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Furthermore, for a state in the $n=2, l=1$ manifold (the $2p$ level), the only possible E1 decay channel is to the $n=1, l=0$ state (the $1s$ ground state). This means that once the atom reaches any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability (or branching ratio) of 1.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Branching Ratios for the First Transition:**\n    The overall probability for a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, i.e., the probability of the atom in the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state decaying into a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    The probability of a transition from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the transition dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\vec{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d} = -e\\vec{r}$.\n\n    The branching ratio for the decay into a specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n    $B(m') = \\frac{|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\vec{d} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2}{\\sum_{m''=-1,0,1} |\\langle 2,1,m'' | \\vec{d} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2}$\n\n    We need to compare the magnitudes of the matrix elements for $m'=-1, 0, 1$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has a spherically symmetric wavefunction ($Y_{0,0}$ is a constant).\n    *   The electric dipole interaction, when averaged over all possible polarizations and directions of the emitted photon, is isotropic.\n    *   Therefore, there can be no preferred final state $m'$. The decay must populate the three possible final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ with equal probability.\n\n    More formally, using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the matrix element squared is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    $|\\langle 2,1,m' | d_q^{(1)} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,m' \\rangle|^2$.\n    This coefficient is non-zero only for $q=m'$, and its value is $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle = 1$ for all $m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n    This confirms that the transition rates to each of the three $m'$ sublevels are equal.\n\n    Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first decay step, the branching ratio for each is $1/3$.\n    $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Probability for Each Route:**\n    The total probability of a cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **Route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$**: $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   **Route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$**: $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   **Route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$**: $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,-1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$.

The transitions are specified as electric dipole transitions. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer.\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State**\n    Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. The transition occurs in two steps:\n    *   **Step 1:** $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$\n    *   **Step 2:** $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$\n\n    Let's apply the selection rules to both steps.\n\n    *   **For Step 1: $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n        *   Initial state has $l=0$.\n        *   The selection rule $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$ implies $l' - 0 = \\pm 1$, so the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   The selection rule $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$ implies $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, so the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n        *   Since this is a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. Looking at the options provided, the intermediate state is always a state with $n'=2$.\n        *   Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **For Step 2: $|n' l' m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$**\n        *   Let's check if a transition from our possible intermediate states $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n        *   Initial state (for this step) has $l'=1$. Final state has $l_{final}=0$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$.

This is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step in the cascade.\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 1: $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2, 1, m'\\rangle$**\n        The initial state $|3, 0, 0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, when the atom decays by emitting a photon, there is an equal probability of it transitioning to any of the magnetic sublevels ($m'$) of the final energy level.\n        The possible final states for the first step are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$. Since there are three equally probable destination states, the probability (branching ratio) for transitioning to any one of them is $1/3$.\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 2: $|2, 1, m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$**\n        Once the atom is in one of the intermediate states, say $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, it will decay further. The only available energy level below the $n=2$ level is the $n=1$ level. The state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$. We have already established that the dipole transition $|2, 1, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$ is allowed. Since this is the only possible decay channel via a dipole transition to a lower energy state, the probability of this step occurring, given the atom is in the state $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, is 1. The same logic applies to the other intermediate states, $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$ and $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$.\n        *   $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$ for any $m'$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Overall Probability of the Route**\n    The total probability of a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    Let's evaluate the route given in option C: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Probability = $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    *   Probability = $(1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options**\n    *   A) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{2}{3}$.

Understand the Process and Selection Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a two-step photon emission process, where a hydrogen atom in the $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ state decays to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. The selection rules for an E1 transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n*   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   Change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   The principal quantum number $n$ must change ($\\Delta n \\neq 0$), and for decay (emission), energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n**2. Analyze the First Transition**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n*   **Intermediate state:** Let this be $|int\\rangle = |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n\nApplying the selection rules for the first transition:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{int} - l_i = l_{int} - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we have $l_{int} = 1$.\n*   $\\Delta n = n_{int} - n_i < 0 \\implies n_{int} < 3$. Since $l_{int}=1$, we must have $n_{int} \\geq 2$. So, the only possibility is $n_{int} = 2$.\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{int} - m_i = m_{int} - 0 = m_{int} = 0, \\pm 1$. So, $m_{int}$ can be $-1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n\nTherefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All options correctly identify one of these as part of a potential route.\n\n**3. Analyze the Second Transition**\n\n*   **Intermediate state:** $|int\\rangle = |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$.\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n\nApplying the selection rules for the second transition from any of the possible intermediate states:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_{int} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$.\n*   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_{int} = 0 - m_{int} = -m_{int}$. For this to be allowed, we need $-m_{int}$ to be in $\\{0, \\pm 1\\}$, which is true for all possible $m_{int} \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n*   $\\Delta n = n_f - n_{int} = 1-2 = -1$. This is an allowed decay.\n\nThus, all three decay routes are possible:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4. Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n\nThe probability of a particular decay path is the product of the branching ratios at each step.\n\n*   **Branching Ratio for the first step ($B_1$)**:\n    The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a $3s$ orbital), which is spherically symmetric. When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, the emission is isotropic (the same in all directions). This means there is no preferred orientation for the final state's angular momentum. As a result, the atom has an equal probability of landing in any of the available magnetic substates of the intermediate level. Since there are three possible intermediate states ($m_{int}=-1,0,1$), the probability of transitioning to any specific one is the same.\n    $B_1 = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each of $m_{int} \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n    (This can be formally shown using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, where the transition rate is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_i, m_i; 1, q | l_f, m_f \\rangle^2$. For the transition from $l=0$ to $l=1$, this coefficient's squared value is independent of the final $m_f$.)\n\n*   **Branching Ratio for the second step ($B_2$)**:\n    The atom is now in an intermediate state $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ (a $2p$ orbital). We need to find the probability that it will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's consider what other decay channels are available from the $2p$ state. According to the dipole selection rules, the atom can only decay to a state with $l=0$ or $l=2$. For energy to be released, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease ($n<2$). The only available state that meets these criteria is the $n=1, l=0$ state (the $1s$ ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$). There is no $n=1, l=2$ state.\n    Therefore, the decay from any $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ state *must* proceed to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. There are no other competing E1 decay channels.\n    Thus, the branching ratio for the second step is 1.\n    $B_2 = P(|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n*   **Total Probability**:\n    The total probability for any of the three complete decay routes is the product of the branching ratios:\n    $P_{route} = B_1 \\times B_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**5. Compare with Options**\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (should be $\\frac{1}{3}$).\n*   B) Typo in the question, but assuming the route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, the probability of $\\frac{2}{3}$ is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (should be $\\frac{1}{3}$).\n\nThe only option that presents a valid route with its correct corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\nThe question asks about a two-step electric dipole transition in a non-relativistic Hydrogen atom. The atom decays from the initial state `|3,0,0>` to the final state `|1,0,0>` through an intermediate state. We need to identify a valid transition route and the probability associated with that specific path. The notation used is `|n, l, m>`, where `n` is the principal quantum number, `l` is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and `m` is the magnetic quantum number.\n\n**2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions:**\nFor a transition to be allowed under the electric dipole approximation, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be `Δl = ±1`.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be `Δm = 0, ±1`.\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, `Δn`, can be any integer (`Δn = 0, ±1, ±2, ...`).\n\n**3. Analyze the First Transition Step:**\nThe atom transitions from the initial state `|i⟩ = |3,0,0⟩` to an intermediate state `|int⟩ = |n',l',m'⟩`.\n*   **Initial State:** `n=3, l=0, m=0`.\n*   **Applying Selection Rules:**\n    *   `Δl = l' - l = l' - 0 = ±1`  implies that the intermediate state must have `l' = 1`.\n    *   `Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, ±1` implies that the intermediate state can have `m' = -1, 0, or 1`.\n*   The options provided suggest that the intermediate state has `n' = 2`. This is an allowed change (`Δn = 2 - 3 = -1`).\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,-1⟩`, `|2,1,0⟩`, and `|2,1,1⟩`.\n\n**4. Analyze the Second Transition Step:**\nThe atom transitions from the intermediate state `|int⟩ = |2,1,m'⟩` to the final state `|f⟩ = |1,0,0⟩`.\n*   **Intermediate State:** `n'=2, l'=1, m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}`.\n*   **Final State:** `n''=1, l''=0, m''=0`.\n*   **Applying Selection Rules:**\n    *   `Δl = l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1`. This satisfies the `Δl = ±1` rule.\n    *   `Δm = m'' - m' = 0 - m'`. For `Δm` to be `0` or `±1`, we require `m'` to be `0` or `±1`.\n*   This confirms that all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final `|1,0,0⟩` state. All the transition routes listed in the options are physically allowed.\n\n**5. Determine the Probability of Each Route:**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. In a cascade decay, the total process branches out at the first step. The probability of following a specific path is determined by the **branching ratio** of that first decay.\n\n*   The three possible first-step transitions are:\n    1.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩`\n    2.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩`\n    3.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩`\n\n*   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment `|<final|**d**|initial>|^2`. For spontaneous emission, we consider the rates for these three channels.\n\n*   A key physical insight is required here: The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` is an s-state, which is **spherically symmetric**. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. Since the atom in its initial state has no preferred direction, and spontaneous emission is an isotropic process (it occurs with equal probability in all directions), there can be no preference for which of the three `m'` sublevels of the `l'=1` state is populated.\n\n*   Therefore, the probabilities of decaying into each of the three `m'` states must be equal.\n    *   `P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)`\n\n*   Since these three paths are the only possible outcomes for the first decay (to the `n=2, l=1` manifold), their probabilities must sum to 1.\n    *   `P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1`\n    *   `3 × P(any single m') = 1`\n    *   `P(any single m') = 1/3`\n\n**6. Evaluate the Options:**\nNow we compare this calculated probability with the values given in the options.\n\n*   A) Route `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`. The probability for this route is `1/3`. The option gives `1/4`. **Incorrect.**\n*   B) Route `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`. The probability for this route is `1/3`. The option gives `2/3`. **Incorrect.**\n*   C) Route `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`. The probability for this route is `1/3`. The option gives `1/4`. **Incorrect.**\n*   D) Route `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`. The probability for this route is `1/3`. The option gives `1/3`. **Correct.**\n\nThe only option that presents a valid route with the correct corresponding probability is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. The problem states this happens via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means it is a cascade decay involving an intermediate state:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Dipole 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Dipole 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nA single-step transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is forbidden by the electric dipole selection rules, as we will see below.\n\n### 2. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nFor an electric dipole transition between an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number (l):** $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number (m):** $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number (n):** $\\Delta n$ can be any integer value ($\\Delta n = n' - n \\neq 0$). For a decay (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ (so $n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l' = 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $E_{n'} < E_3$. In the non-relativistic hydrogen atom, energy only depends on $n$: $E_n = -E_R/n^2$, where $E_R$ is the Rydberg energy. $E_{n'} < E_3$ means $-E_R/n'^2 < -E_R/3^2$, which simplifies to $1/n'^2 > 1/9$, or $n'^2 < 9$. This implies $n' < 3$. So possible values for $n'$ are 1 and 2.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Final state: $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$ (so $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$).\n*   The intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ is the initial state for this transition. We found above that $l'=1$ and $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This is satisfied for $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $E_{n'} > E_1$. This means $-E_R/n'^2 > -E_R/1^2$, which implies $1/n'^2 < 1$, or $n' > 1$.\n\n**Combining the conditions for n':**\nFrom the first transition, we found $n' \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\nFrom the second transition, we found $n' > 1$.\nThe only integer value that satisfies both conditions is $n' = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the intermediate state must be of the form $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$, where $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n### 4. Identifying the Possible Transition Routes\nBased on the allowed intermediate states, there are three possible cascade routes:\n*   **Route 1:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Route 2:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Route 3:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll the routes listed in options A, C, and D are valid possible pathways according to the selection rules.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the \"corresponding probability\". In the context of multiple decay paths, this refers to the branching ratio of the first transition. The total decay probability for the atom in the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to decay to the level $n=2$ is split among the three possible $m'$ sublevels of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state.\n\nThe transition probability from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$.\nFor the first transition, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric.\n*   Due to the rotational invariance of the electromagnetic interaction and the spherical symmetry of the initial state, there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   Therefore, the probability of decaying into any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ sublevels must be the same, regardless of the value of $m'$. This is a direct consequence of the Wigner-Eckart theorem.\n*   Since there are three possible and equally likely final states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$), the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them.\n\nSo, the branching ratio for each channel is:\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\nOnce the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it will decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state with probability 1 (as this is the only allowed E1 decay channel from the 2p state). Therefore, the probability associated with each entire cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n### 6. Comparing with the Options\nLet's check the given options:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    *   The route is valid.\n    *   The probability (branching ratio) is correct.\n\n*   **B) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    *   The initial state is missing (typographical error), but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid.\n    *   The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid.\n    *   The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\nOnly option A provides a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the state |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via two electric dipole transitions. We must follow the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:\n    *   Change in the principal quantum number, `n`: `Δn` can be any integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), `n` decreases.\n    *   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, `l`: `Δl = ±1`.\n    *   Change in the magnetic quantum number, `m`: `Δm = 0, ±1`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Initial, Intermediate, and Final States**\n    *   Initial state: `|i⟩ = |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩` (a `3s` state).\n    *   Final state: `|f⟩ = |n=1, l=0, m=0⟩` (a `1s` state).\n    *   The transition from `l=0` to `l=0` directly is forbidden because `Δl=0`. It must proceed through an intermediate state `|int⟩ = |n', l', m'⟩` in a two-step process:\n        `|3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n\n3.  **Determine the Properties of the Intermediate State**\n    *   **First Transition:** `|3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩`\n        *   `Δl = l' - l = l' - 0 = ±1`. Since `l'` must be non-negative, we must have `l' = 1`. The intermediate state must be a `p` state.\n        *   `Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = m'`. The selection rule is `Δm = 0, ±1`, so `m'` can be `0, 1, -1`.\n        *   The principal quantum number `n'` must be less than 3 for a decay process. The options provided suggest `n'=2`. So the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,0⟩`, `|2,1,1⟩`, and `|2,1,-1⟩`. These are the `2p` orbitals.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** `|n', l', m'⟩ = |2, 1, m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n        *   `Δl = l_final - l' = 0 - 1 = -1`. This satisfies the `Δl = ±1` rule.\n        *   `Δm = m_final - m' = 0 - m'`. This must be `0` or `±1`.\n        *   If `m' = 0`, then `Δm = 0`. Allowed.\n        *   If `m' = 1`, then `Δm = -1`. Allowed.\n        *   If `m' = -1`, then `Δm = 1`. Allowed.\n    *   So, all three potential intermediate states (`|2,1,0⟩`, `|2,1,1⟩`, `|2,1,-1⟩`) can decay to the final state `|1,0,0⟩`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Branching Ratios (Probabilities)**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio for that path compared to all other possible paths. The overall process is the cascade `3s → 2p → 1s`. We need to find the probability of the atom taking a specific intermediate `2p` state.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩`\n        The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` is a `3s` state, which is spherically symmetric (`l=0`). When it decays, there is no preferred direction in space (unless an external field is applied, which is not stated). Therefore, the emission process populates the three possible final `m'` states (`m'=-1, 0, 1`) with equal probability.\n        Let `W(i→f)` be the transition rate. The rates `W(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩)`, `W(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩)`, and `W(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩)` are equal due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state.\n        Let the total rate of decay from `3s` to `2p` be `W_{total}`.\n        `W_{total} = W(m'=-1) + W(m'=0) + W(m'=1)`\n        Since `W(m'=-1) = W(m'=0) = W(m'=1)`, the probability (branching ratio) of transitioning to any single `m'` state is:\n        `P(3s → 2p, specific m') = W(m') / W_{total} = 1/3`.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** `|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n        Once the atom is in an intermediate state, say `|2,1,0⟩`, it will decay again. The only dipole-allowed transition to a lower energy level is to the `|1,0,0⟩` (`1s`) state. (There are no `n=1, l=0` or `n=1, l=2` states to decay to). Therefore, the probability of this second step, given that the atom is in a `2p` state, is 1.\n        `P(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = 1` for any `m'`.\n\n    *   **Total Probability for a specific path**\n        The probability of a complete cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n        Let's take the path given in option A: `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`.\n        `P(path A) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)`\n        `P(path A) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   **A) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `1/3`**\n        This matches our calculation. The path is valid, and the probability (branching ratio) is correct.\n\n    *   **B) `... → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `2/3`**\n        The probability is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`**\n        The path is valid, but the probability should be `1/3`, not `1/4`.\n\n    *   **D) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`**\n        The path is valid, but the probability should be `1/3`, not `1/4`.\n\nTherefore, option A provides a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the process:**\nThe problem describes a cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through an intermediate state. The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. We need to determine the specific path (i.e., the intermediate state) and the probability of this path.\n\n**2. Apply Selection Rules for Dipole Transitions:**\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers $(n, l, m)$:\n*   **Parity change:** The parity of the state, given by $(-1)^l$, must change. This implies that $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial}$ must be an odd integer. For one-photon dipole transitions, the rule is more restrictive.\n*   **Orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Principal quantum number:** $\\Delta n$ can be any integer. For a decay (emission), $n$ must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State:**\nThe decay proceeds in two steps:\n*   **Step 1:** Initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ decays to an intermediate state $|int\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Step 2:** Intermediate state $|int\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$ decays to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nLet's apply the selection rules to both steps:\n*   **For Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   $l_i = 0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, we must have $l' = 1$.\n    *   $m_i = 0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, we can have $m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n    *   For decay, $n'$ must be less than $n_i=3$.\n*   **For Step 2 ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   $l_f = 0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$. This is consistent with what we found from Step 1.\n    *   $m_f = 0$. The intermediate state's magnetic quantum number $m'$ must satisfy $m_f - m' = 0 \\Rightarrow m'=0$ or $m_f - m' = \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow m' = \\mp 1$. So, $m'$ can be $0, 1, -1$.\n    *   For decay, $n'$ must be greater than $n_f=1$.\n\nCombining these conditions, the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ must have $1 < n' < 3$, which means $n'=2$. It must have $l'=1$, and $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$.\nSo, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\nAll the routes proposed in the options A, B, C, and D are valid possible routes for the cascade decay.\n\n**4. Calculate the Transition Probability:**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route, for example, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\nThe overall probability of a cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n$P_{cascade} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$\n    This is the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ into a specific substate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric ($Y_{0,0}$ is a constant). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the three degenerate sublevels of the $2p$ state: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n    The decay from the $3s$ state can only proceed to a $2p$ state via dipole transition (since $n$ must decrease and $l$ must become 1). There are no other allowed decay channels. So, the total probability of decaying to the $2p$ manifold is 1.\n    Since the three final substates are equally probable, the probability of decaying into any specific one is:\n    $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    Once the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it will decay further. We need to find the probability that it decays to $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    For an atom in the state $|2,1,0\\rangle$, the only state with lower energy it can decay to via an electric dipole transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the $1s$ ground state). The transition is allowed by the selection rules ($\\Delta l = -1, \\Delta m = 0$). Since this is the *only* possible dipole decay channel, the probability of this decay occurring is 1. An atom in the $2p$ state will certainly decay to the $1s$ state.\n    So, $P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$. The same logic applies to the states $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**5. Calculate Total Probability for each option:**\n*   **For options A and B:** Route is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The probability is $P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **For option C:** Route is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The probability is $P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **For option D:** Route is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The probability is $P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing our calculated probability with the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ - Incorrect probability.\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ - Correct route and probability.\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\n\nThus, option B correctly identifies a possible transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition Process:**\n    The problem asks about the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> (also known as the 3s state) to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0> (the 1s ground state). This decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules:**\n    For an electric dipole transition to occur, the following selection rules for the quantum numbers must be satisfied:\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n\n3.  **Determine the First Transition Step:**\n    *   Initial state: |3,0,0>\n    *   A direct transition to |1,0,0> is forbidden because Δl = 0 - 0 = 0, which violates the Δl = ±1 rule. Therefore, a cascade via an intermediate state is necessary.\n    *   For the first transition from |3,0,0>, the selection rules require the intermediate state |n',l',m'> to have:\n        *   l' = l + 1 = 1 (since l=0 and l cannot be negative, only Δl=+1 is possible).\n        *   m' = m + Δm = 0 + (0, ±1) = 0, ±1.\n        *   n' must be less than 3 for an emission process. The options suggest n'=2. The |n'=2, l'=1> state is the 2p state.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. All three are valid possibilities.\n\n4.  **Determine the Second Transition Step:**\n    *   The second transition is from one of the intermediate states |2,1,m'> to the final state |1,0,0>.\n    *   Let's check the selection rules for this step:\n        *   Δl = l_final - l'_initial = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   Δm = m_final - m'_initial = 0 - m'. This is allowed for m' = 0, ±1, as the result will be 0, ∓1.\n    *   So, all three routes proposed in options A, B, and D are valid sequences of dipole transitions:\n        *   |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n        *   |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n        *   |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability of Each Route:**\n    The \"probability\" in this context refers to the branching ratio of the decay. The probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step (Branching ratio for 3s → 2p):**\n        The initial state |3,0,0> is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric (l=0). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space (i.e., the choice of the z-axis is arbitrary). The decay process must reflect this symmetry. The three possible final states for this step, |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>, are the magnetic sublevels of the p-orbital (l=1). Due to the rotational symmetry of the initial state and the interaction, the probability of decaying into any of these three sublevels must be equal.\n        Therefore, the probability of decaying into any specific m' state is 1/3.\n        *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n        *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n        *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step (Branching ratio for 2p → 1s):**\n        Once the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'> states (the 2p level), it will decay to a lower energy state. The only available state with lower energy is the |1,0,0> ground state (1s). The transition from l=1 to l=0 is allowed by the dipole selection rules. Since this is the only possible decay channel, any atom that reaches the 2p level is guaranteed to decay to the 1s state.\n        Therefore, the branching ratio for this step is 1 (or 100%).\n        *   P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) = 1, for any m'.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.

The selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions are:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl, must be ±1. (Δl = l<sub>final</sub> - l<sub>initial</sub> = ±1)\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm, must be 0 or ±1. (Δm = m<sub>final</sub> - m<sub>initial</sub> = 0, ±1)\n    *   The principal quantum number, n, has no selection rule (Δn can be anything), but for a decay process (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, which means n must decrease in the non-relativistic hydrogen atom model where energy E<sub>n</sub> ∝ -1/n<sup>2</sup>.\n\n2.  **Determine the intermediate state.**\n    Let the intermediate state be denoted by |n', l', m'⟩. The process is:\n    |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n    *   **First transition:** |3, l=0, m=0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩\n        *   Since l=0, for Δl=±1, we must have l'=1.\n        *   For decay, n' < 3.\n        *   The state must exist, so for l'=1, the lowest possible value of n' is 2.\n        *   If n'=1, l' cannot be 1.\n        *   Therefore, the intermediate state must have n'=2 and l'=1.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = m'. So, m' can be 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   The possible intermediate states are: |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** |2, l'=1, m'⟩ → |1, l=0, m=0⟩\n        *   Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   Δm = 0 - m'. This must be 0, ±1. Since m' can be 0, ±1, this condition is satisfied for all three possible intermediate states.\n\n    This confirms that the decay can proceed through any of the three intermediate states: |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n3.  **Calculate the probabilities (Branching Ratios).**\n    We need to find the probability of a specific path, for example, the one given in option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. The total probability of this cascade is the product of the branching ratio of the first step and the branching ratio of the second step.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** The intermediate state is |2,1,m'⟩ (a 2p state). The only state with lower energy it can decay to via an electric dipole transition is the |1,0,0⟩ state (1s state). (Decay to |2,0,0⟩ is forbidden because Δl=-1 is required, but l is already 0, and decay to other n=2 states is not possible). Thus, the branching ratio for the decay |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is 1 (or 100%).\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** We need the branching ratio for the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩. This is the rate of this specific transition divided by the sum of the rates of all possible transitions from |3,0,0⟩ to the n=2, l=1 level.\n        The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (3s state) is spherically symmetric. Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon.\n        *   A transition to m'=0 (Δm=0) corresponds to emitting a z-polarized photon.\n        *   A transition to m'=±1 (Δm=±1) corresponds to emitting a circularly polarized photon in the x-y plane.\n        Since the initial state has no preferred orientation in space, the probabilities of transitioning to each of the three magnetic sublevels (m' = -1, 0, +1) of the l'=1 state must be equal.\n\n        The total probability of decaying from |3,0,0⟩ to the |2,1, *⟩ level is 1 (considering only this decay channel). This total probability is distributed equally among the three possible final m' states.\n        P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)\n        Since the sum of these probabilities is 1, each must be 1/3.\n\n    *   **Total Probability for the Route in option A:**\n        P_total = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\n        P_total = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\n4.  **Evaluate the options.**\n    *   A) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability 1/3.

Incorrect probability (should be 1/3).\n\nTherefore, option A provides a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Problem\nThe question asks for a valid decay route and its corresponding probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the excited state `|3,0,0>` to the ground state `|1,0,0>` via a cascade of two electric dipole transitions. The states are represented in the `|n,l,m>` notation, where `n` is the principal quantum number, `l` is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and `m` is the magnetic quantum number.\n\n### 2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions\nFor an atom to transition between two states by emitting a photon (an electric dipole transition), specific selection rules must be met. For a transition from `|n, l, m>` to `|n', l', m'>`:\n*   **Δl = l' - l = ±1** (The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one unit).\n*   **Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1** (The magnetic quantum number can remain the same or change by one unit).\n*   For emission, the energy must decrease, so **n' < n**.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Two-Step Transition Pathway\nThe decay process happens in two steps, involving an intermediate state `|n_i, l_i, m_i>`:\n`|3,0,0>` → `|n_i, l_i, m_i>` → `|1,0,0>`\n\n**Step 1: `|3,0,0>` → `|n_i, l_i, m_i>`**\nLet's apply the selection rules to the initial state `(n=3, l=0, m=0)`.\n*   The options suggest the intermediate state has `n_i = 2`. Since `2 < 3`, this is a valid decay.\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The initial state has `l=0`. Thus, `l_i - 0 = ±1`. As `l` must be non-negative, the only possibility is `l_i = 1`.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The initial state has `m=0`. Thus, `m_i - 0 = m_i`, so the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number `m_i` are -1, 0, and +1.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,-1>`, `|2,1,0>`, and `|2,1,1>`. All routes proposed in the options A, B, and D use one of these valid intermediate states.\n\n**Step 2: `|n_i, l_i, m_i>` → `|1,0,0>`**\nNow we verify if the second transition is allowed from the intermediate states `|2,1,m_i>` to the final ground state `|1,0,0>`.\n*   **Δl**: `l' - l_i = 0 - 1 = -1`. This satisfies the Δl = ±1 rule.\n*   **Δm**: `m' - m_i = 0 - m_i`. This must be 0, ±1. Since `m_i` can be -1, 0, or 1, the change `Δm` can be +1, 0, or -1, respectively. All are allowed.\n\nTherefore, all three cascade pathways are allowed by the selection rules.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question is to find the probability of a specific route. This \"probability\" is the branching ratio, which is determined by the relative strengths of the different possible transitions.\n\nThe transition rate for the first step, from `|3,0,0>` to `|2,1,m_i>`, depends on the square of the transition dipole moment. Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial `l=0` state, there is no preferred direction of emission. This means the atom has an equal chance of transitioning to any of the three `m_i` sublevels of the `l_i=1` state.\n\nThus, the total probability of 1 is split equally among the three possible decay channels:\n*   `P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3`\n*   `P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3`\n*   `P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3`\n\nOnce the atom is in a specific intermediate state (e.g., `|2,1,0>`), it will decay to the ground state `|1,0,0>` with certainty (as it is the only allowed subsequent dipole transition to `n=1`). Therefore, the probability of the entire cascade is determined solely by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\nThe probability of the specific route `|3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>` is the probability of the first step, which is 1/3.\n\n### 5. Final Answer\nComparing our result with the options:\n*   A) `|3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>` and `1/4`. (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) `|3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>` and `1/3`. **(Correct route and probability)**\n*   C) `... → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>` and `2/3`. (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) `|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>` and `1/4`. (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a two-step radiative decay process for a hydrogen atom, from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. The decay proceeds via an intermediate state through two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n2.  **Recall the Selection Rules for E1 Transitions:**\n    For an electric dipole transition between an initial state |n,l,m⟩ and a final state |n',l',m'⟩, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   Change in the principal quantum number, Δn = n' - n, can be any integer. For decay, n' < n.\n    *   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl = l' - l, must be ±1.\n    *   Change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = m' - m, must be 0 or ±1.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → Intermediate State |n',l',m'⟩**\n    *   Initial state: |3,0,0⟩, so n=3, l=0, m=0.\n    *   Applying the Δl rule: Δl = ±1 means l' = l ± 1 = 0 ± 1. Since l' must be non-negative, the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n    *   Applying the Δm rule: Δm = 0, ±1 means m' = m + Δm = 0 + Δm. So the intermediate state can have **m' = 0, +1, or -1**.\n    *   For decay, n' < n, so n' can be 2 or 1. However, if n'=1, then l' must be 0 (since l < n). But we found l'=1, so the intermediate state cannot have n'=1. Thus, the intermediate state must have **n' = 2**.\n    *   Combining these findings, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩. These correspond to the three sublevels of the 2p orbital.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Transition: Intermediate State |2,1,m'⟩ → Final State |1,0,0⟩**\n    *   Initial state (for this step): |2,1,m'⟩ where m' can be 1, 0, or -1. So n=2, l=1.\n    *   Final state: |1,0,0⟩, so n'=1, l'=0, m'=0.\n    *   Let's check the selection rules for each possible intermediate state:\n        *   From |2,1,m'⟩: Δl = l' - l = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   For the transition to be to |1,0,0⟩, the change in m must be Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m'.\n            *   If m' = 1, Δm = -1 (allowed).\n            *   If m' = 0, Δm = 0 (allowed).\n            *   If m' = -1, Δm = +1 (allowed).\n    *   Therefore, a dipole transition from any of the three |2,1,m'⟩ states to the |1,0,0⟩ state is allowed.\n    *   All options provided in the question identify one of these valid routes, specifically through one of the |2,1,m'⟩ states.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of the Specified Route**\n    The problem asks for the probability of a specific route, which is the product of the branching ratios for each step.\n    *   **Probability of Step 1: Branching Ratio for |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩**\n        The total decay rate from the |3,0,0⟩ state is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. As determined in step 3, the only possible decay channels are to the three states |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n        The rate of spontaneous emission between two states |i⟩ and |f⟩ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, `|<f|r|i>|^2`.\n        The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (an s-state) is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the three degenerate sublevels m' = -1, 0, +1 are equally probable.\n        Rate(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = Rate(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = Rate(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩).\n        Let this rate be `A`. The total decay rate from |3,0,0⟩ is `A_total = A + A + A = 3A`.\n        The branching ratio (probability) for the transition into any single specific `m'` state is:\n        `BR = A / A_total = A / (3A) = 1/3`.\n        So, the probability of the first step being |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ is **1/3**.\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 2: Branching Ratio for |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n        The atom is now in the intermediate state, e.g., |2,1,0⟩. We need to find its decay channels. The only lower energy level it can decay to via a dipole transition is the n=1 level. For n=1, l must be 0. So, the only possible final state is |1,0,0⟩.\n        Since this is the only allowed decay channel from any |2,1,m'⟩ state, the branching ratio for this transition is 1 (or 100%).\n        So, the probability of the second step, e.g., |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, is **1**.\n\n    *   **Total Probability of the Cascade Route**\n        The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route specified in options C and D:\n        `P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = P_step1 * P_step2`\n        `P = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3`.\n        The same logic applies to the routes via m'=-1 and m'=1, they each have a total probability of 1/3.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options**\n    Let's check the options against our calculated probability.\n    A) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩, Probability 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n    B) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩, Probability 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n    C) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩, Probability 2/3. (Incorrect probability)\n    D) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩, Probability 1/3. (Correct route and probability)\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe question asks for the transition route and the corresponding probability for the decay from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions.\nThe decay must proceed in two steps:\n1. |3,0,0⟩ $\\rightarrow$ |n',l',m'⟩\n2. |n',l',m'⟩ $\\rightarrow$ |1,0,0⟩\n\nFor the first step, the selection rules ($\\Delta l=\\pm1, \\Delta m=0, \\pm1$) dictate that the intermediate state must have $l'=1$. Since $l'<n'$, the principal quantum number $n'$ can be 2. So the intermediate states are the degenerate |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩ states.\nSince the initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$), the transition probabilities to the three degenerate $m'$ states of the $l'=1$ level are equal. Therefore, the branching ratio for the transition to any one of these states is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nFor the second step, consider the decay from any of the intermediate states, e.g., |2,1,0⟩. The selection rules allow a transition to the |1,0,0⟩ state ($\\Delta l=-1, \\Delta m=0$). This is the only allowed dipole decay channel to a lower energy state. Thus, the branching ratio for this second step is 1.\n\nThe total probability for the specific route |3,0,0⟩$\\rightarrow$|2,1,0⟩$\\rightarrow$|1,0,0⟩ is the product of the branching ratios of the two steps:\n$P = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes a decay from the hydrogen atom state |n=3, l=0, m=0> to the ground state |n=1, l=0, m=0>. This transition cannot happen via a single electric dipole (E1) transition because the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl, would be 0, which violates the E1 selection rule Δl = ±1.\n    The problem states the decay occurs via **two dipole transitions**. This means it's a cascade decay through an intermediate state. Let the intermediate state be |n', l', m'>.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State**\n    We need to apply the dipole selection rules for each step of the cascade.\n\n    *   **First Transition:** |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'>\n        *   Δl = l' - l = l' - 0 = ±1. Since l' must be non-negative, we must have **l' = 1**.\n        *   Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, ±1. So, the possible values for m' are **m' = -1, 0, 1**.\n        *   Δn can be anything. For a decay process, the energy decreases, so n' < n. The most probable intermediate state will be the one with the largest energy gap, which is typically the lowest possible principal quantum number, n'. The problem options suggest the intermediate state has n'=2, which is energetically allowed (E₃ > E₂) and follows the cascade decay pattern.\n\n    So, the possible intermediate states are |2, 1, -1>, |2, 1, 0>, and |2, 1, 1>.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** |2, 1, m'> → |1, 0, 0>\n        *   Δl = l_final - l_intermediate = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed by the selection rule (Δl = ±1).\n        *   Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m'. This must be 0 or ±1.\n            *   If m' = -1, Δm = 1 (Allowed).\n            *   If m' = 0, Δm = 0 (Allowed).\n            *   If m' = 1, Δm = -1 (Allowed).\n        *   Δn = 1 - 2 = -1 (Allowed).\n\n    Thus, all three states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> are valid intermediate states that can decay to the final state |1,0,0>. This means there are three possible decay routes.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Each Route**\n    The problem asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This refers to the branching ratio for that specific channel.\n\n    *   **Step 1 Probability:** The initial state is |3,0,0>, which is an s-state. Its wavefunction is spherically symmetric (independent of angles θ and φ). Because of this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the first photon. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate sub-levels |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1>.\n        The total transition rate from |3,0,0> to the |2,1> manifold is Γ_total. This total rate is the sum of the rates to the individual m' states:\n        Γ_total = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) + Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) + Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>)\n        Due to the symmetry, the rates are equal:\n        Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>)\n        Therefore, the probability (or branching ratio) for the first step to proceed via any specific m' state is 1/3.\n        P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3.\n        P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3.\n        P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3.\n\n    *   **Step 2 Probability:** Once the atom is in a specific intermediate state, say |2,1,0>, it will decay to |1,0,0>. As this is the only available E1 decay channel to the ground state, the probability of this second step, given that the first step has occurred, is 1 (or 100%).\n\n    *   **Overall Probability:** The probability of a specific cascade route is the probability of the first step. For the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, the probability is the probability of the first transition, which is 1/3. The same holds for the other two routes.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options**\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and Probability: 1/4. The route is possible, but the probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n    B) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and Probability: 1/3. The route is possible, and the probability is correct.\n    C) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and Probability: 2/3. The route is possible, but the probability is incorrect.\n    D) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and Probability: 1/4. The route is possible, but the probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\nThe only option that provides a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability is B.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The question asks for the decay route and probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the |3,0,0> (3s) state to the |1,0,0> (1s) state via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state, and two photons are emitted sequentially. This process is a cascade decay.\n\n2.  **Recall the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:** For a transition from a state |n,l,m> to |n',l',m'>, the selection rules are:\n    *   Δl = l' - l = ±1\n    *   Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1\n\n3.  **Determine the intermediate state:**\n    *   **First transition:** The atom starts in |3,0,0> (l=0, m=0).\n        *   Applying the Δl rule: Δl = l' - 0 = ±1. Since l must be non-negative, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: Δm = m' - 0 = 0, ±1. So the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   So the intermediate state is of the form |n', 1, m'> where m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}.\n    *   **Second transition:** The atom must end up in the |1,0,0> state. The transition is from |n', 1, m'> to |1,0,0>.\n        *   Applying the Δl rule: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: Δm = 0 - m'. This must be 0, ±1. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate m' values (-1, 0, 1).\n    *   **The principal quantum number n' of the intermediate state:** The problem describes a two-photon decay. The rate of such a process is calculated using second-order perturbation theory, and the amplitude involves a sum over all possible intermediate states |n',l',m'>. The amplitude is proportional to 1/(E_initial - E_intermediate). To maximize the transition rate, the energy difference in the denominator should be minimized. The energy of a state is given by E_n = -R_H/n^2.\n        *   E_initial = E_3s = -R_H/9.\n        *   The possible intermediate states are |n'p> states (l=1).\n        *   For n'=2, E_intermediate = E_2p = -R_H/4. Denominator term: |E_3s - E_2p| = |-R_H/9 + R_H/4| = 5R_H/36.\n        *   For n'=4, E_intermediate = E_4p = -R_H/16. Denominator term: |E_3s - E_4p| = |-R_H/9 + R_H/16| = 7R_H/144.\n        The denominator is smallest for n'=2. Therefore, the cascade overwhelmingly proceeds through the |2,1,m'> intermediate states. The problem options all use |2,1,m'>, confirming this.\n\n4.  **Determine the possible decay routes:** Based on the above, there are three possible cascade routes, all passing through the n=2, l=1 (2p) shell:\n    *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability of each route:**\n    *   The probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, because the second step (2p -> 1s) is the only allowed decay channel for the 2p state, so its probability is 1.\n    *   The probability (branching ratio) of the first transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$ is given by:\n        $P(m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m''=-1,0,1} \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m''\\rangle)}$\n        where Γ is the transition rate.\n    *   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. For a spontaneous decay from a spherically symmetric state in the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transition rates to each of the magnetic sublevels m' = -1, 0, +1 of the p-state (l=1) must be equal.\n    *   This can be formally shown by calculating the matrix elements, which confirms that $|\\langle 2,1,0 | z | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,1 | (x+iy)/\\sqrt{2} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,-1 | (x-iy)/\\sqrt{2} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$. In fact, the total rate to $|2,1,1\\rangle$, summing over polarizations, is proportional to $|\\langle 2,1,1|x|3,0,0\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,1|y|3,0,0\\rangle|^2$, which can be shown to be equal to $|\\langle 2,1,0|z|3,0,0\\rangle|^2$.\n    *   So, $\\Gamma(m'=-1) = \\Gamma(m'=0) = \\Gamma(m'=1)$.\n    *   The total transition rate is $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma(m'=-1) + \\Gamma(m'=0) + \\Gamma(m'=1) = 3\\Gamma(m'=0)$.\n    *   The probability for the decay to proceed through any specific sublevel m' is:\n        $P(m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(m')}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma(m')}{3\\Gamma(m')} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   Each of the three possible routes has a probability of 1/3.\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid physical statement is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\n\nThe problem describes a two-step radiative decay of a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Initial State:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. In spectroscopic notation, this is the 3s state.\n*   **Final State:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. In spectroscopic notation, this is the 1s state.\n*   **Mechanism:** The decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|m\\rangle$.\n*   **The overall process is:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{photon 1}} |m\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{photon 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Applying Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nFor a transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ to be allowed by the E1 selection rules, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n*   **Δl = l' - l = ±1**\n*   **Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1**\n*   **Δn = n' - n** can be any integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), energy must be released, so the energy of the final state must be lower, which generally means n' < n.\n\n### 3. Identifying the Intermediate State $|m\\rangle = |n_m, l_m, m_m\\rangle$\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions in the cascade.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_m, l_m, m_m\\rangle$**\n*   **l-selection rule:** $l_m - l_{initial} = l_m - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l_m = 1$. This means the intermediate state is a p-state.\n*   **m-selection rule:** $m_m - m_{initial} = m_m - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m_m$ are $0, +1, -1$.\n*   **n-selection rule:** For decay, $n_m < n_{initial} = 3$. The possible values for $n_m$ are 1 or 2.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n_m, l_m, m_m\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **l-selection rule:** $l_{final} - l_m = 0 - l_m = \\pm 1$. This confirms our finding from the first step that $l_m = 1$.\n*   **m-selection rule:** $m_{final} - m_m = 0 - m_m = 0, \\pm 1$. This means $m_m$ can be $0, +1, -1$. This is consistent with what we found for the first transition.\n*   **n-selection rule:** For decay, $n_{final} < n_m$. Since $n_{final} = 1$, we must have $n_m > 1$.\n\n**Combining the conditions:**\nFrom the first transition, we need $l_m=1$ and $n_m < 3$. From the second transition, we need $l_m=1$ and $n_m > 1$. The only integer value for $n_m$ that satisfies both is $n_m=2$.\n\nTherefore, the intermediate state $|m\\rangle$ must be a $|2,1,m_m\\rangle$ state, where $m_m \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. These correspond to the $2p_z$ ($m_m=0$), $2p_x$, and $2p_y$ orbitals.\n\n### 4. Identifying Possible Transition Routes\n\nBased on the possible values for the intermediate state, there are three distinct decay routes:\n*   **Route 1:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Route 2:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Route 3:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll four options provided in the question correspond to these valid routes. We now need to determine the probability of each route.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe probability of a particular decay route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. This is because once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m_m\\rangle$ states, it has only one allowed dipole decay channel: to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Thus, the second transition in the cascade happens with a probability of 1.\n\nThe probability of the first transition, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_m\\rangle$, depends on the transition rate, $\\Gamma$, which is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n$\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m_m | \\hat{\\mathbf{d}} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (3s orbital) is spherically symmetric (its angular wavefunction $Y_{0,0}$ is a constant). When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the degenerate destination sublevels.\n\nThe destination sublevels are the three degenerate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. Since they are energetically degenerate (in the absence of external fields) and the initial state has no directional preference, the transition probability is distributed equally among them.\n\n*   Total probability of decaying from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $|2,1\\rangle$ level is 1 (as it's the only path).\n*   There are 3 possible final m-states for this transition.\n*   Probability for each m-state = (Total Probability) / (Number of states) = $1/3$.\n\nSo, the probabilities for the first step are:\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\nSince the probability of the second step in each cascade is 1, the total probability for each route is determined solely by the probability of the first step.\n*   **Prob(Route 1):** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   **Prob(Route 2):** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   **Prob(Route 3):** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### 6. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's check the given options against our findings:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   This matches our calculated route and probability for Route 1.\n*   B) Same route as A, but probability $\\frac{2}{3}$. Incorrect probability.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, option A provides a correct transition route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Process and Selection Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a two-step radiative decay from the excited state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ of a hydrogen atom to its ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via an intermediate state through two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n*   **Parity Change:** The parity of the state, given by $(-1)^l$, must change. This is ensured by the `l` selection rule.\n*   **Angular Momentum Quantum Number `l`:** $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Magnetic Quantum Number `m`:** $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   There is no strict rule for the principal quantum number `n`, but for a decay (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n**2. First Transition: from |3,0,0> to an Intermediate State**\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$, where $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Intermediate State:** Let's call it $|n'', l'', m''\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the selection rules for `l`:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l'' - l = l'' - 0 = \\pm 1$.\n    *   Since $l''$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l'' = 1$.\n*   Applying the selection rules for `m`:\n    *   $\\Delta m = m'' - m = m'' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are $m'' = -1, 0, 1$.\n*   For the principal quantum number `n`, the process is a two-step cascade from $n=3$ to $n=1$. This implies the intermediate state must have $n''=2$.\n\nCombining these, the possible intermediate states are:\n*   $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$\n*   $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$\n*   $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$\n\n**3. Second Transition: from Intermediate State to |1,0,0>**\n\nNow, let's check if the transitions from these possible intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ are allowed.\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$, where $n=1, l=0, m=0$.\n*   For any of the intermediate states $|2, 1, m''\\rangle$:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l'' = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m'' = 0 - m'' = -m''$. Since $m'' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, the possible values for $\\Delta m$ are $+1, 0, -1$, all of which are allowed.\n\nSo, all three transition routes are physically possible:\n*   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4. Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n\nThe probability of a specific route occurring is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. This is because once the atom is in one of the intermediate $|2,1,m''\\rangle$ states, it has only one allowed dipole decay channel to reach the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nThe transition rate $\\Gamma$ for spontaneous emission from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the electric dipole operator $\\mathbf{r}$:\n$\\Gamma_{i \\to f} \\propto |\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe operator $\\mathbf{r}$ can be decomposed into spherical tensor components $r_q$ (where $q=\\Delta m$):\n*   $r_{+1} \\propto (x+iy)$ corresponds to $\\Delta m = +1$.\n*   $r_0 \\propto z$ corresponds to $\\Delta m = 0$.\n*   $r_{-1} \\propto (x-iy)$ corresponds to $\\Delta m = -1$.\n\nThe matrix element can be separated into a radial part and an angular part. The angular part is described by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n$\\Gamma(|n,l,m\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle) \\propto |R_{n'l' \\leftarrow nl}|^2 \\times |\\langle l,m; 1,q | l',m' \\rangle|^2$, where $q = m' - m$.\n\nLet's calculate the relative rates for the first transition, from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the three possible intermediate states:\n*   The radial integral $R_{2,1 \\leftarrow 3,0}$ is the same for all three transitions because it only depends on the quantum numbers $(n,l)$ and $(n',l')$, not on $m$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the angular part for each path:\n1.  **To $|2,1,-1\\rangle$:** $m'' = -1$. We need $q = \\Delta m = -1 - 0 = -1$.\n    Rate $\\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,-1 | 1,-1 \\rangle|^2$.\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding an angular momentum of 0 to any other angular momentum is always 1 (i.e., $\\langle l_1, m_1; 0, 0 | l_1, m_1 \\rangle = 1$).\n    So, the angular part squared is $1^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **To $|2,1,0\\rangle$:** $m'' = 0$. We need $q = \\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$.\n    Rate $\\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,0 | 1,0 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n\n3.  **To $|2,1,1\\rangle$:** $m'' = 1$. We need $q = \\Delta m = 1 - 0 = 1$.\n    Rate $\\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,1 | 1,1 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n\nSince both the radial and angular parts are identical for the three possible transitions, the transition rates are equal. Let's call the rate $\\Gamma_0$.\n*   $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\Gamma_0$\n*   $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma_0$\n*   $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\Gamma_0$\n\nThe total transition rate out of $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (to the $2p$ shell) is $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n\nThe probability (or branching ratio) for each path is the rate for that path divided by the total rate:\nProbability(path) = $\\frac{\\Gamma_0}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, each of the three possible routes has a probability of $1/3$.\n\n**5.

The process is specified as happening via \"two dipole transitions\". This means it's a two-step process, also known as a cascade decay.\n    *   Initial State ($|i\\rangle$): $|3,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Final State ($|f\\rangle$): $|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Intermediate State ($|k\\rangle$): Let's denote this as $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:**\n    For an electric dipole transition to occur, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer value, but for decay (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State(s):**\n    *   **Step 1:** Transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n        *   $l=0 \\rightarrow l'$: According to $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   $n=3 \\rightarrow n'$: Since energy must decrease, $n'<3$. The most probable decay is to the next available energy level, so we consider $n'=2$. Thus, the intermediate state is a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (a 2p state).\n        *   $m=0 \\rightarrow m'$: According to $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate magnetic quantum number can be $m' = 0, +1, -1$.\n    *   So, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Step 2:** Transition from $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   $l'=1 \\rightarrow l_f=0$: This gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is an allowed transition.\n        *   $m'=m' \\rightarrow m_f=0$: This gives $\\Delta m = -m'$. Since $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$, $\\Delta m$ can be $1, 0, -1$, which are all allowed.\n        *   $n'=2 \\rightarrow n_f=1$: Energy decreases, so this decay is allowed.\n\n    *   Therefore, there are three valid two-step transition routes:\n        1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of each Route:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n    *   Probability(Route via $m'$) = BR($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$) $\\times$ BR($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$).\n\n    *   **Second Step:** The only dipole-allowed decay from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. (Decay to $|2,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l=0$). Thus, the branching ratio for this step is 1 for all three routes.\n        BR($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) = 1.\n\n    *   **First Step:** We need the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states. The branching ratio is the ratio of the rate of a specific transition to the total transition rate.\n        BR($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$) = $\\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\Gamma_{total}(|3,0,0\\rangle)}$.\n\n    *   The total decay rate in this two-step dipole channel is the sum of the rates to the three intermediate states:\n        $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) + \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) + \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$.\n\n    *   The transition rate $\\Gamma(i \\rightarrow f)$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$. We need to compare the rates $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$ for $m'=-1, 0, 1$.\n\n    *   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). There is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom must decay with equal probability to each of the degenerate final states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. Any experiment measuring the population of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states after the decay from an ensemble of atoms initially in the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state would find them to be equally populated.\n\n    *   **Formal Calculation (using the Wigner-Eckart Theorem):** The transition rate is proportional to $|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\vec{d}_q | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d}_q$ are the spherical tensor components of the dipole operator and $q=\\Delta m = m'$. The Wigner-Eckart theorem states that this matrix element is the product of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and a reduced matrix element that is independent of the magnetic quantum numbers.\n        $\\langle 2,1,m' | d_{m'} | 3,0,0 \\rangle \\propto \\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$.\n        The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle j_1,0; j_2,m_2 | J,m_2 \\rangle$ with $j_1=0$ is always equal to 1.\n        Therefore, the matrix elements have the same magnitude for all three values of $m'$, and consequently, the transition rates are equal:\n        $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$.\n\n    *   Since the three rates are equal, the branching ratio to each of these states is $1/3$.\n        BR($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$) = $\\frac{\\Gamma_0}{\\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Final Probability and Conclusion:**\n    The overall probability for any of the three specific routes is:\n    Probability(Route via $m'$) = $(1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\n    Now, let's examine the given options:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct path and probability)\n    C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Garbled, but incorrect probability)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only option that matches our derivation is B. The probability of the cascade $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is indeed $1/3$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

    "The user wants me to identify the most consistent answer among the provided solutions for a quantum mechanics problem.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physical Process:**\n    The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state `|3,0,0⟩` (a 3s state) to the final state `|1,0,0⟩` (the 1s ground state). This happens via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state. The overall process is: `|3,0,0⟩ → |intermediate⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules:**\n    The rules governing E1 transitions are:\n    *   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: `Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1`.\n    *   Change in the magnetic quantum number: `Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1`.\n    *   For decay, the principal quantum number `n` must decrease (`n_final < n_initial`).\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **First Transition (|3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩):**\n        *   The initial state has `l=0`. Applying the `Δl = ±1` rule, the intermediate state must have `l' = 1`.\n        *   The initial state has `m=0`. Applying the `Δm = 0, ±1` rule, the intermediate state can have `m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}`.\n        *   Since this is a decay from `n=3` that must then decay to `n=1`, the intermediate state's principal quantum number `n'` must be `1 < n' < 3`. This means `n'` must be 2.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are the three sublevels of the 2p orbital: `|2,1,-1⟩`, `|2,1,0⟩`, and `|2,1,1⟩`.\n\n    *   **Second Transition (|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩):**\n        *   This transition is from `l'=1` to `l=0`, so `Δl = -1`, which is allowed.\n        *   The change `Δm = 0 - m'` is `+1, 0, -1` for `m' = -1, 0, 1` respectively. All are allowed.\n        *   The decay `n'=2 → n=1` is also allowed.\n\n    This confirms that there are three possible cascade routes through the `|2,1,-1⟩`, `|2,1,0⟩`, and `|2,1,1⟩` states.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of Each Route:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step.\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 2:** For any intermediate state `|2,1,m'⟩`, the only possible E1 decay channel is to the ground state `|1,0,0⟩`. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 1:** We need to find the branching ratio for the decay `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩`. A key physical principle is the spherical symmetry of the initial state. The `|3,0,0⟩` state (an s-state) has no preferred orientation in space. Consequently, when it decays spontaneously into the isotropic vacuum, it has an equal probability of transitioning into any of the available degenerate final sublevels.\n        The three available states (`|2,1,-1⟩`, `|2,1,0⟩`, `|2,1,1⟩`) are distinguished only by their orientation (magnetic quantum number `m'`). Due to the symmetry, the transition rates to these three states must be equal.\n\n        Since the three possible decay channels are equally probable, and they are the only ones available for this E1 transition, their probabilities must sum to 1. Therefore, the probability for each specific channel is `1/3`.\n\n    *   **Overall Probability:** The total probability for any specific route `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` is the product of the probabilities of each step: `P = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    The problem asks to select the most consistent answer, which should represent a valid physical statement.\n    *   **Route:** All routes proposed are physically possible.\n    *   **Probability:** The calculated probability for *any* of the three routes is `1/3`.\n\n    Let's check the given options:\n    *   A) `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`. (Probability is incorrect)\n    *   B) `⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `2/3`. (Typo in the question, but the probability is incorrect).\n    *   C) `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `1/3`. (**Correct** path and probability).\n    *   D) `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`. (Probability is incorrect).\n\n### Conclusion\nAlmost all the provided solution methods correctly identify the possible routes and, through the symmetry argument, calculate the probability of any given route as `1/3`. The one exception (Answer 25) uses an incorrect method and arrives at `2/3` for the `m'=0` route. Disregarding that outlier, the consensus is strong. Option C is the only one that pairs a valid route with the correctly derived probability of `1/3`.\n\n<<<C>>>"

This means it's a cascade decay:\n    |3,0,0> → intermediate state → |1,0,0>\n\n2.  **Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions:**\n    For a transition from an initial state |n, l, m> to a final state |n', l', m'>, the following rules must be satisfied:\n    *   **Parity change:** The parity of the state, given by (-1)^l, must change. This implies that Δl = l' - l must be an odd integer. For one-photon E1 transitions, this simplifies to Δl = ±1.\n    *   **Angular momentum projection:** The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = m' - m, must be 0 or ±1. (Δm = 0 corresponds to a π-polarized photon, and Δm = ±1 corresponds to σ±-polarized photons).\n    *   **Principal quantum number:** The change in the principal quantum number, Δn, can be any integer, but for decay (spontaneous emission), we must have E_initial > E_final, which generally means n_initial > n_final.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State(s):**\n    *   **First transition:** from |i> = |3, 0, 0> to |int>.\n        *   l_i = 0. According to the Δl = ±1 rule, the intermediate state must have l_int = 1.\n        *   m_i = 0. According to the Δm = 0, ±1 rule, the intermediate state can have m_int = 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   The problem implies the cascade goes via the n=2 shell, so the intermediate states are of the form |2, 1, m_int>.\n    *   **Second transition:** from |int> = |2, 1, m_int> to |f> = |1, 0, 0>.\n        *   l_int = 1. The final state has l_f = 0. The change is Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed.\n        *   m_f = 0. The change is Δm = 0 - m_int. For this to be allowed (Δm = 0, ±1), the initial m_int must be 0, +1, or -1. This is consistent with our finding for the first transition.\n\n    Therefore, there are three possible cascade routes, distinguished by the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate |2,1,m> state:\n    *   **Path -1:** |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n    *   **Path 0:**  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n    *   **Path +1:** |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of Each Route:**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. In the context of branching processes, this is the branching ratio for that specific path. The probability of a cascade path is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n    P(path m) = BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m>) × BR(|2,1,m> → |1,0,0>)\n\n    *   **Step 1: Branching Ratio for |3,0,0> → |2,1,m>**\n        The initial state |3,0,0> (a 3s state) is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the three degenerate sublevels |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> are equally probable.\n        Let Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m>) be the transition rate to a specific sublevel m. Due to rotational symmetry:\n        Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>)\n        Let's call this rate Γ₀.\n        The total decay rate of the |3,0,0> state is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. The only allowed E1 decay from 3s is to a 2p state (since 1p does not exist).\n        Γ_total(|3,0,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) + Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) + Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 3Γ₀\n        The branching ratio for the transition into a specific sublevel 'm' is:\n        BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m>) = Γ₀ / (3Γ₀) = 1/3.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Branching Ratio for |2,1,m> → |1,0,0>**\n        Once the atom is in a state |2,1,m> (a 2p state), it will decay. The only energetically lower state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the |1,0,0> state (1s), as Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 is allowed. There are no other allowed E1 decay channels.\n        Therefore, the probability of a |2,1,m> state decaying to |1,0,0> is 1.\n        BR(|2,1,m> → |1,0,0>) = 1.\n\n    *   **Overall Probability for a Specific Path:**\n        P(path m) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Each of the three possible cascade routes has a probability of 1/3.

The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$. The process is:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** The rules for an E1 transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   Parity must change. The parity of a state is given by $(-1)^l$. Since $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, parity is automatically changed, so this rule is redundant with the $\\Delta l$ rule.\n    *   For emission, the energy of the final state must be lower than the initial state, so $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Determine the intermediate state(s):**\n    *   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$\n        *   Initial state: $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying selection rules:\n            *   $\\Delta l = l_{int} - l_i = l_{int} - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l_{int} = 1$.\n            *   $\\Delta m = m_{int} - m_i = m_{int} - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m_{int}$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n            *   $n_{int} < n_i = 3$. Also, we must have $n_{int} \\ge l_{int} + 1 = 1+1=2$. The only possible value for $n_{int}$ is 2.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Initial intermediate state: $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle = |2, 1, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n        *   Final state: $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check the selection rules:\n            *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_{int} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n            *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_{int} = 0 - m_{int}$. For this to be $0, \\pm 1$, $m_{int}$ must be $0, \\pm 1$. This is consistent with the possible intermediate states we found.\n        *   The transition from any of the $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ states to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed by the selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The \"probability\" of a certain transition route refers to its branching ratio. The branching ratio for a specific decay channel is the rate of that channel divided by the total decay rate of the initial state.\n\n    *   **First transition probability:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$\n        The rate of spontaneous emission from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is given by Fermi's Golden Rule and is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n        $W_{i \\rightarrow f} \\propto |\\langle f | e\\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = e^2 (|\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2)$.\n\n        The initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to this symmetry, the atom has no preferred orientation in space. Therefore, the probability of decaying into any of the final magnetic sublevels $|f_m\\rangle = |2,1,m\\rangle$ must be the same, regardless of the value of $m$.\n        So, the transition rates are equal:\n        $W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$.\n\n        The state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ can only decay via E1 transition to a $|n,1,m\\rangle$ state. Since $n$ must be less than 3, the only possible destination is the $n=2$ level. Thus, the total decay rate of the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is the sum of the rates to these three intermediate states:\n        $W_{total} = W_{m=-1} + W_{m=0} + W_{m=1}$.\n        Since the three rates are equal, let's call them $W_m$. Then $W_{total} = 3 W_m$.\n\n        The probability (branching ratio) of decaying into a specific intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{W_{m=0}}{W_{total}} = \\frac{W_m}{3W_m} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n        Similarly, the probability of decaying into $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is $1/3$, and into $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n\n    *   **Second transition probability:** $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        Once the atom is in one of the intermediate states $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$, it needs to decay further. The only state with lower energy is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The transition to this state is allowed by E1 selection rules. Since this is the only possible decay channel, the probability of this transition occurring is 1 (or 100%).\n        $P(|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$ for $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total probability of the cascade:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    Let's consider the route proposed in option C: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The probability of this route is:\n    $P_{route} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    $P_{route} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. Incorrect probability.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $1/3$. Incorrect probability.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $1/3$. Incorrect probability.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability is C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes a decay from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through a two-step electric dipole (E1) transition. This means there is an intermediate state, and each of the two steps must obey the E1 selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for decay, the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State**\n    Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First Transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n        *   From the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$, we have $l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l'=1$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   For the principal quantum number $n'$, it must be less than 3.\n    *   **Second Transition:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   To reach the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$, we have $l_{final}=0, m_{final}=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $0 - l' = \\pm 1$. This implies $l'=1$, which is consistent with the first step.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This implies $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$, also consistent.\n    *   The energy of the intermediate state must be between the initial and final states. Since $E_n \\propto -1/n^2$, we must have $E_3 < E_{n'} < E_1$, which means $1 < n' < 3$. Thus, $n'$ must be 2.\n\n    Combining these results, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This means there are three possible transition routes. All options A, B, C, and D propose valid intermediate states according to the selection rules. We need to determine the probability.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of each Route**\n    The probability of a specific decay route is the product of the branching ratios of each step in the cascade.\n\n    **Step 1: Branching Ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a 3s state) is spherically symmetric.\n    *   The decay rate from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the transition dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$, where the square indicates a sum over the components: $|\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   Because the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric, the total decay rates to each of the degenerate final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equal due to rotational invariance. Let's call this rate $\\Gamma_1$.\n    *   The total decay rate from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state via E1 transition is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. The only states accessible from 3s via a single E1 transition are the $np$ states with $n<3$. The only such state is the 2p level. So, the total E1 decay rate is $\\Gamma_{tot,1} = \\Gamma(3,0,0\\to 2,1,-1) + \\Gamma(3,0,0\\to 2,1,0) + \\Gamma(3,0,0\\to 2,1,1) = \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_1 = 3\\Gamma_1$.\n    *   The branching ratio (probability) for the atom to take a specific path to one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states is:\n        $BR_1(m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\Gamma_{tot,1}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_1}{3\\Gamma_1} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   So, the atom has a 1/3 probability of landing in any of the three intermediate states.\n\n    **Step 2: Branching Ratio for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The intermediate state is a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (a 2p state).\n    *   We need to find the decay channels from this state. According to the E1 selection rules ($\\Delta l = \\pm 1$), a 2p state ($l=1$) can only decay to an s-state ($l=0$). The only lower-energy s-state is the 1s state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$).\n    *   Since this is the only possible decay channel for the 2p state, any atom in a 2p state will eventually decay to the 1s state with 100% probability.\n    *   Therefore, the branching ratio for this second step is 1, regardless of the value of $m'$.\n        $BR_2(m') = 1$.\n\n    **Overall Probability**\n    The total probability for a specific route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,m'\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the branching ratios for each step:\n    $P(\\text{route through } m') = BR_1(m') \\times BR_2(m') = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options**\n    This result shows that all three possible routes have the same probability of 1/3.\n    *   Route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$: Probability = 1/3\n    *   Route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$: Probability = 1/3\n    *   Route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: Probability = 1/3\n\n    Now we check the given options:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n\n    Only option D presents a valid route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies there is an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n    The process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_1} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_2} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:**\n    *   Change in principal quantum number $\\Delta n$: any integer.\n    *   Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$.\n    *   Change in magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Determine the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n    *   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n        *   Initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' = m \\pm (0,1) = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. The options provided in the question suggest that the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is also the most probable transition.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Initial intermediate state has $l'=1$. Final state has $l=0$. This satisfies $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$.\n        *   For each possible $m'$, we check $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$.\n            *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. Allowed.\n            *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. Allowed.\n            *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = +1$. Allowed.\n        *   All three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Determine the possible decay routes:**\n    Based on the selection rules, there are three possible cascade routes through the $n=2$ shell:\n    *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability (branching ratio) for each route:**\n    The probability of a particular route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step. This is because the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ has only one possible decay channel via a single dipole transition (to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state), so the branching ratio for the second step is 1 for all three routes.\n\n    The branching ratio for the first step, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$, is the ratio of the partial decay rate for that specific channel to the total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The decay rate for a transition $|i\\rangle \\to |f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    Rate$(|i\\rangle \\to |f\\rangle) \\propto \\omega^3 |\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = \\omega^3 (|\\langle f|x|i\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f|y|i\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f|z|i\\rangle|^2)$.\n\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). In spontaneous emission from a spherically symmetric state, there is no preferred direction. Therefore, the emission populates the magnetic sublevels of the final state equally.\n\n    Let's verify this by calculation. The rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ depends on the radial integral $\\mathcal{R} = \\int R_{21}(r) r^3 R_{30}(r) dr$ and an angular part.\n    *   **Rate for $m'=0$:** The transition is $\\Delta m=0$, governed by the $z$ operator ($z=r\\cos\\theta$). The squared angular matrix element is $|\\langle Y_{1,0} | \\cos\\theta | Y_{0,0} \\rangle|^2 = 1/3$.\n    *   **Rate for $m'=\\pm 1$:** The transitions are $\\Delta m=\\pm 1$, governed by the $x$ and $y$ operators ($x \\pm iy = r\\sin\\theta e^{\\pm i\\phi}$). The sum of squared angular matrix elements is $|\\langle Y_{1,\\pm 1} | x | Y_{0,0} \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle Y_{1,\\pm 1} | y | Y_{0,0} \\rangle|^2 = 1/3$.\n\n    So, the decay rates for transitions to each of the three intermediate states are equal:\n    Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle$)\n\n    Let this rate be $A_0$. The total decay rate (to the $n=2, l=1$ level) is the sum of these three rates:\n    $A_{total} = A_0 + A_0 + A_0 = 3A_0$.\n\n    The probability (branching ratio) for any one of these paths is:\n    $P(\\text{route via } m') = \\frac{\\text{Rate to } |2,1,m'\\rangle}{A_{total}} = \\frac{A_0}{3A_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Incorrect probability)\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. (Correct route and probability)\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

(Incorrect probability, though the route is valid)\n\n    The only option that matches our derivation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process:** The problem describes a decay from the hydrogen atom's |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state. This decay occurs via two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state. The process is a cascade decay:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Apply Dipole Selection Rules for the First Transition:**\n    The selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer (for decay, $n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n    For the first transition, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$:\n    *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   From the options, the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is a valid decay.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow l' = 1$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply Dipole Selection Rules for the Second Transition:**\n    For the second transition, $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   Initial state: $n'=2, l'=1, m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Final state: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the rule.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   This confirms that all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. All routes shown in the options are physically allowed.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of the Cascade:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n    $P(\\text{path}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n    $P(\\text{path via } m') = \\text{BR}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) \\times \\text{BR}(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Branching Ratio for Step 1:**\n    *   The branching ratio for the transition to a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is the rate of that transition divided by the total decay rate from the initial state.\n    *   The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$. This state has $l=0$ and is therefore spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the decay must proceed to each of the three magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state with equal probability.\n    *   This can be shown formally using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, where the transition rate is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $|\\langle l_i, m_i, 1, q | l_f, m_f \\rangle|^2$. For the transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$, we have $l_i=0, m_i=0, l_f=1, m_f=m', q=m'$. The coefficient is $|\\langle 0,0,1,m'|1,m' \\rangle|^2 = 1$ for all $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since the rates are equal, and there are three possible channels, the probability for each is $1/3$.\n    *   So, $\\text{BR}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each $m'=-1, 0, 1$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Branching Ratio for Step 2:**\n    *   The intermediate state is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. We need to find all possible E1 decay channels from this state.\n    *   The selection rules require $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. So the final state must have $l=0$ or $l=2$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n_{final} < 2$. The only possibility is $n_{final}=1$.\n    *   For $n=1$, the only possible value for orbital angular momentum is $l=0$.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible decay channel for the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state via a single dipole transition is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.\n    *   Since this is the only decay path, its branching ratio is 1.\n    *   $\\text{BR}(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Probability and Choose the Correct Option:**\n    *   The probability for any of the three complete cascade paths is:\n        $P(\\text{path via } m') = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   This means each of the three routes is equally likely, with a probability of $1/3$.\n    *   Now, let's examine the options:\n        A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n        B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n        C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n        D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n\n    Option D presents one of the three valid routes and provides the correctly calculated probability of $1/3$.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\n\nThe problem asks about the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (also known as the 3s state) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state) via a two-step dipole transition. We need to identify a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\nA \"dipole transition\" refers to an electric dipole (E1) transition, which is the most common type of radiative transition in atoms.\n\n### 2. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nE1 transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers $|n, l, m\\rangle$:\n*   **$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly 1.\n*   **$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or 1.\n*   **$\\Delta n$ can be any integer**: The principal quantum number is not restricted, but for a decay (emission), the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Transition Path\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden by the E1 selection rules because for this transition, $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n\nTherefore, the decay must happen in at least two steps, via an intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. This is called a cascade decay.\n\n**Step 1: Decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   Applying the selection rules for the first transition:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$. The intermediate state must be a p-state.\n    *   For a decay, the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$. Since $n=3$, possible values for $n'$ are 1 or 2. An intermediate state with $l'=1$ must have $n' \\ge 2$. Therefore, the only possible intermediate state has $n'=2$. So, the intermediate state is a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (a 2p state).\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Decay from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Intermediate state:** $|i'\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$. Here, $n'=2, l'=1$.\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   Let's check if this transition is allowed:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l=\\pm1$ rule.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = -m'$. For this to be allowed, we need $-m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$, which is true for all possible intermediate states ($m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$).\n\nConclusion: The decay must proceed via a cascade:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, where $m'$ can be -1, 0, or 1. All the routes presented in the options (A, C, D) are physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This refers to the branching ratio of the cascade. The overall probability of a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n**Probability of Step 1: $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$**\n\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$).\n*   The decay is spontaneous emission, which is isotropic (it has no preferred direction).\n*   The three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields).\n*   Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state and the isotropy of the interaction, the transition probability to each of the degenerate final substates must be equal.\n*   There are 3 possible final substates. Therefore, the probability of decaying into any single one of them is $1/3$.\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    (This is relative to the total decay rate from 3s to 2p).\n\n**Probability of Step 2: $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$**\n\n*   Once the atom is in a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (a 2p state), it needs to decay to a lower energy level.\n*   The only state with energy lower than 2p that is accessible via an E1 transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (1s state). Decay to any other state is either energetically forbidden or violates selection rules.\n*   Therefore, the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state will decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state with a probability of 1 (or a branching ratio of 100%).\n\n**Overall Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe total probability for a specific route is $P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2})$.\nFor the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$:\nProbability = $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe same logic applies to the other possible routes via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. Their probabilities are also $1/3$.\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on our findings:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    *   The route is valid. The calculated probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This option is correct.\n\n*   **B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (it should be $\\frac{1}{3}$).\n\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (it should be $\\frac{1}{3}$).\n\nTherefore, the only correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process:** The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via a two-step process, with an intermediate state. The question specifies that these are electric dipole transitions (E1).\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an E1 transition between an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number $n$ is not restricted ($\\Delta n$ can be any integer), but for a decay (spontaneous emission), energy must be released, so $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **First transition:** The atom decays from the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state $|int\\rangle = |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $l_i = 0$, so $l_{int}$ must be $1$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $m_i = 0$, so $\\Delta m = m_{int} - 0 = m_{int}$. This means $m_{int}$ can be $0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule: For decay, $n_{int} < n_i = 3$. The options provided all suggest an intermediate state with $n_{int}=2$. This is the most likely decay, as the transition frequency ($\\omega \\propto 1/n_f^2 - 1/n_i^2$) is largest for the smallest possible change in $n$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** The atom decays from the intermediate state $|int\\rangle = |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $l_{int} = 1$ and $l_f = 0$, so $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $m_f = 0$, so $\\Delta m = 0 - m_{int}$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$, which is true for all possible intermediate values of $m_{int}$ ($0, \\pm 1$).\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule: $n_f=1 < n_{int}=2$. This is allowed.\n\n    *   Conclusion: All three routes are possible:\n        *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of Each Route:**\n    *   The overall probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, assuming the intermediate state has only one path to the final state (which is true here, as $|2,1,m\\rangle$ can only decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via E1).\n    *   The branching ratio for the transition to a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ is the ratio of the rate of that specific transition to the total rate of all possible transitions from the initial state.\n    *   The transition rate $W_{i \\to f}$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element: $W_{i \\to f} \\propto |\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\mathbf{d} = e\\mathbf{r}$ is the electric dipole operator.\n    *   We need to calculate the rates for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ for $m_{int} = 0, +1, -1$. The rate is proportional to $|\\langle 2,1,m_{int} | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,m_{int} |x| 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m_{int} |y| 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m_{int} |z| 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Matrix Elements:**\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). This has a significant consequence. The Wigner-Eckart theorem shows that for a transition from a spherically symmetric state, the transition rates to each of the magnetic sublevels of the final state are equal.\n    *   Let's verify this. Let $\\mathcal{R}$ be the radial integral $\\int R_{21}(r) r R_{30}(r) r^2 dr$, which is a constant factor for all three transitions. The calculation of the angular parts gives:\n        *   For $m_{int} = 0$: The transition is driven by the $z$ component of the dipole operator. $|\\langle 2,1,0 | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,0 | z | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{1}{3}\\mathcal{R}^2$.\n        *   For $m_{int} = +1$: The transition is driven by the $x$ and $y$ components. $|\\langle 2,1,1 | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle x \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle y \\rangle|^2 = (\\frac{\\mathcal{R}^2}{6}) + (\\frac{\\mathcal{R}^2}{6}) = \\frac{1}{3}\\mathcal{R}^2$.\n        *   For $m_{int} = -1$: The calculation is similar to $m_{int}=+1$ and gives $|\\langle 2,1,-1 | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{1}{3}\\mathcal{R}^2$.\n\n6.  **Determine the Branching Ratios:**\n    *   The transition rates are equal: $W_{|300\\rangle \\to |210\\rangle} = W_{|300\\rangle \\to |211\\rangle} = W_{|300\\rangle \\to |21-1\\rangle}$. Let's call this rate $W_0$.\n    *   The only allowed E1 decays from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ are to these three states. So, the total decay rate is $W_{total} = W_0 + W_0 + W_0 = 3W_0$.\n    *   The probability (branching ratio) for any one of these routes is:\n        $P(m_{int}) = \\frac{W_0}{W_{total}} = \\frac{W_0}{3W_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Process and Selection Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies there must be an intermediate state.\n\nThe selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for decay (spontaneous emission), $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n    *   Initial state has $l=0$. According to the $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   Initial state has $m=0$. According to the $\\Delta m=0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For a decay, we need $n' < 3$. So, $n'$ can be 1 or 2. However, for $n=1$, only $l=0$ is possible ($|1,1,m'\\rangle$ does not exist). Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n    *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Second transition:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Intermediate state has $l'=1$. Final state has $l_f=0$. So $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Intermediate state has $m'$. Final state has $m_f=0$. So $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This is allowed if $-m'$ is $0$ or $\\pm 1$, which is true for $m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n    *   $n'=2 \\to n_f=1$ is an allowed decay.\n\nSo, the decay must proceed through one of the three states in the $n=2, l=1$ (or 2p) manifold. The three possible routes are:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll routes listed in the options are physically possible. We need to determine the probability of the specific route mentioned.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe \"probability\" of a specific decay route in a cascade is the product of the branching ratios at each step.\n\n*   **Step 1: Branching Ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n\nThe branching ratio for a transition to a specific final state is the rate of that transition divided by the total decay rate of the initial state. The transition rate is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle final | e\\mathbf{r} | initial \\rangle|^2$.\n\nWe need to compare the transition rates from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\nA key physical principle simplifies this calculation: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a 3s state) is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay process, which is governed by the fundamental laws of electromagnetism, cannot have a preferred outcome regarding the orientation of the final state. This means that the three final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$, which are distinguished only by their magnetic quantum number $m'$ (i.e., their orientation in space), must be populated with equal probability.\n\nSince there are three possible, equiprobable outcomes for the first decay step, the probability (branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any single one of them is $1/3$.\n\nSo,\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n*(This can be confirmed with a detailed calculation using the Wigner-Eckart theorem or by explicitly computing the matrix elements, which shows that $|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$ is independent of $m'$.)*\n\n*   **Step 2: Branching Ratio for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\nOnce the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, we need to find its decay channels.\nFrom $|2,1,0\\rangle$, a dipole transition requires $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   If $\\Delta l = -1$, the final state has $l_f=0$. The only possible state with $n_f < 2$ is $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This transition is allowed.\n*   If $\\Delta l = +1$, the final state would have $l_f=2$. This requires $n_f \\ge 3$. Since this is a decay ($n_f < n'$), this channel is not possible.\n\nThus, any state in the 2p manifold ($|2,1,m'\\rangle$) can only decay to the 1s state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$) via an E1 transition. There are no other allowed E1 decay channels. Therefore, the branching ratio for this second step is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability for the Cascade**\n\nThe total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\nLet's consider the route in option C: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nProbability = $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\nProbability = $(1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\nThis same probability of $1/3$ applies to the other two possible routes as well.\n\n**4.

(Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism for each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. We need to find the intermediate state and the probability of that specific decay path.\n\n2.  **Recall the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions:**\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number $n$ is not restricted, but for spontaneous decay, the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the first transition step: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n'',l'',m''\\rangle$**\n    *   **Initial state:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   **Selection rule for $l$:** Since $l=0$, we must have $\\Delta l = +1$, so the intermediate state must have $l'' = 1$.\n    *   **Selection rule for $m$:** Since $m=0$, we can have $\\Delta m = m'' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. This means the intermediate state can have $m'' = 0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n    *   **Selection rule for $n$:** For decay, $n'' < 3$. The problem options suggest the intermediate state has $n''=2$. This is the most probable transition since the rate depends on the cube of the transition energy ($\\omega^3$), and the $3 \\to 2$ energy gap is smaller than $3 \\to 1$, but the radial integral heavily favors the smallest possible change in $n$. The transition $3s \\to 1p$ is not possible as the $1p$ state does not exist. Thus, the only possible intermediate state is of the form $|2,1,m''\\rangle$.\n    *   **Conclusion for step 1:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the second transition step: $|2,1,m''\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   **Initial state (intermediate):** $|2,1,m''\\rangle$, so $n''=2, l''=1$.\n    *   **Final state:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$, so $n_{final}=1, l_{final}=0, m_{final}=0$.\n    *   **Selection rule for $l$:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l'' = 0 - 1 = -1$.

In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the $2p$ state.\n        The transition rates $\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m'')$ are proportional to the square of the transition matrix element $|\\langle 2,1,m'' | e\\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$. A detailed calculation (using the Wigner-Eckart theorem or direct integration) confirms that the rates are identical for $m''=-1, 0, +1$.\n        Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for each is $1/3$.\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 2:** $P(|2,1,m''\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n        We need to consider all possible decay channels from the $|2,1,m''\\rangle$ state (the $2p$ state). According to the E1 selection rules, the atom can only decay to a state with $l=0$ or $l=2$. For decay, the final state must have a lower energy, so $n_{final} < 2$. The only state satisfying these conditions is the $1s$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$). There are no $d$-states with $n<2$.\n        Therefore, the *only* possible E1 decay from the $2p$ state is to the $1s$ state. This means the probability of this step is 1, regardless of the value of $m''$.\n        $P(|2,1,m''\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for any of the three cascade paths is $P(\\text{path}) = (1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$.\n        - Path via $|2,1,1\\rangle$: Probability = $1/3$.\n        - Path via $|2,1,0\\rangle$: Probability = $1/3$.\n        - Path via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: Probability = $1/3$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (**Correct path and probability**)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only option that presents a correct transition route with the correct corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAnswering this question requires understanding the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions in a hydrogen atom and calculating the branching ratios for the decay cascade.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states:**\n    *   Initial state: $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the $3s$ state).\n    *   Final state: $|n, l, m\\rangle = |1, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the $1s$ ground state).\n\n2.  **Analyze the decay path using selection rules:**\n    The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for emission, the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n    A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the selection rule. Therefore, the decay must occur via an intermediate state. The problem states it is a two-dipole transition process, which confirms a cascade decay.\n\n3.  **Determine the intermediate state(s):**\n    Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First transition:** $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$\n        *   Energy must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n        *   Selection rule for $l$: $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$, which implies $l'=1$. The intermediate state must be a $p$-state.\n        *   The lowest energy level with a $p$-state below $n=3$ is $n=2$. So, the intermediate state is a $2p$ state, i.e., $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Selection rule for $m$: $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, which implies $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   Thus, the first step of the decay can proceed to any of the three states: $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, or $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|2, 1, m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$\n        *   This transition is from a $2p$ state to the $1s$ ground state.\n        *   Let's check the selection rules: $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ and $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$ must be in $\\{0, \\pm 1\\}$. This is true for all possible $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   This transition is the well-known Lyman-alpha transition. It is an allowed E1 transition.\n\n    So, there are three possible decay routes, all passing through one of the $2p$ sublevels. All the routes given in the options are physically possible. We must now determine the probability of a specific route.\n\n4.  **Calculate the transition probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route, for example, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The total probability of this cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n    $P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** The $2p$ state ($|2,1,m'\\rangle$) can only decay to the $1s$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$) via an E1 transition. All other transitions are forbidden or require higher-order processes. Therefore, the probability of the second step, given the atom is in the intermediate state, is 1.\n        $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** This is the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to a specific sublevel $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. The transition rate $\\Gamma$ from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\vec{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d} = -e\\vec{r}$.\n        $\\Gamma(i \\rightarrow f) \\propto |\\langle f | \\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    Let's calculate the relative rates for the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states.\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric. The interaction Hamiltonian, when averaged over all possible emission directions and polarizations of the photon, is isotropic. This suggests that there should be no preference for any of the final $m'$ states. Therefore, the transitions to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ should be equally probable.\n\n    To confirm this, we can use the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element for a tensor operator $T_q^{(k)}$ is given by:\n    $\\langle n'l'm' | T_q^{(k)} | nlm \\rangle = \\langle lm; kq | l'm' \\rangle \\langle n'l' || T^{(k)} || nl \\rangle$.\n    Here, the operator is the position vector $\\vec{r}$, which is a rank-1 tensor ($k=1$). The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$ and the final state is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. The transition rate is proportional to:\n    $|\\langle 2,1,m' | r_q | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,m' \\rangle|^2 \\cdot |\\langle 2,1 || r || 3,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n    For the transition to be non-zero, we need $m' = m+q = 0+q = q$.\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,q \\rangle = 1$ for all possible values of $q \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    The reduced matrix element $\\langle 2,1 || r || 3,0 \\rangle$ depends only on the principal and orbital quantum numbers ($n, l, n', l'$), not on the magnetic quantum numbers.\n\n    Therefore, the transition rates are equal for all three possible final states:\n    $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle)$.\n\n    The branching ratio for the decay into any one of these specific states is:\n    $B = \\frac{\\Gamma_{\\text{one state}}}{\\Gamma_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\Gamma + \\Gamma + \\Gamma} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{3\\Gamma} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    So, the probability of the first step, e.g., $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle)$, is $1/3$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total probability and conclude:**\n    The total probability for the cascade through a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n    $P_{total} = (\\text{Branching Ratio for first step}) \\times (\\text{Probability of second step}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    Now we check the given options:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$.

Understand the Process and Selection Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a two-step decay process of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means we need to find an intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ such that both transitions are allowed by the E1 selection rules.\n\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**2. Identify the Intermediate State(s)**\n\nThe decay process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n    *   Initial state: $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n    *   Applying selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' = 0, +1, -1$.\n        *   Since it's a decay, $n' < 3$. The decay will preferentially happen to the closest available energy level, which is $n'=2$. (A transition to $n'=1$ with $l'=1$ is impossible, as the $n=1$ shell only has $l=0$).\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n', l', m'\\rangle = |2, 1, m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Let's check if this transition is allowed from our identified intermediate states.\n    *   Initial state: $n_i=2, l_i=1, m_i=m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n    *   Final state: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   Applying selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0 - m'$. This is allowed since $m'$ can be $0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   This confirms that all three states $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ are valid intermediate states. The routes proposed in all options are physically possible.\n\n**3. Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom follows a specific route. This is a product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the First Step: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The probability of the atom decaying into a specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is given by its transition rate divided by the total transition rate to all possible states. This is the branching ratio.\n    *   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element $|\\langle n_f, l_f, m_f | \\mathbf{r} | n_i, l_i, m_i \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the photon. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to transition to any of the degenerate magnetic sublevels of the final state.\n    *   The final states are the three degenerate levels $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first transition, the probability (branching ratio) for the atom to transition into any one of them is $1/3$.\n    *   So,\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n*   **Probability of the Second Step: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Once the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, we need to find the probability of its decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Let's consider all possible E1 decay channels from $|2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n        *   The selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ means the final state must have $l''=0$ or $l''=2$.\n        *   For $l''=2$ (a d-state), the principal quantum number $n''$ must be at least 3. Since this would be an excitation ($n''>2$), it cannot happen via spontaneous emission.\n        *   For $l''=0$ (an s-state), the only possible state with $n''<2$ is the $n''=1$ state, which is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Therefore, the *only* allowed E1 decay channel from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states is to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   This means that if the atom reaches the intermediate level, it is guaranteed to decay to the final state.

Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step radiative decay process in a hydrogen atom, from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This happens via two consecutive electric dipole transitions, which means two photons are emitted. The process can be written as:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_1} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_2} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    where $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules:** The rules for an electric dipole transition between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n = n' - n$ can be any integer. For emission (decay), the energy must decrease, which means $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Determine the intermediate state(s) for the first transition:**\n    *   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   **Intermediate state:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules for the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$. So, the intermediate state is a p-state.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = m' = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta n = n' - 3$ must be negative, so $n' < 3$. The most probable transition is to the closest energy level, which is $n'=2$. The options provided also point to the intermediate state having $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Check the second transition:**\n    *   Let's verify that a transition from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n    *   **Intermediate state:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ with $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate $m'$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   So, all three cascade paths are allowed by the selection rules:\n        *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the transition probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    *   The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio for that route among all possible routes.\n    *   **First transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n        The rate of transition to a specific final state $|f\\rangle$ from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n        The branching ratio for a transition to a specific substate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n        $B(m') = \\frac{|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2}{\\sum_{m''=-1,0,1} |\\langle 2,1,m'' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2}$\n    *   A key physical principle is that the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a 3s state) is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). This means there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the different magnetic substates ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ level must be equally probable.\n    *   Mathematically, this can be shown using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element $\\langle n'l'm'|T_q^{(k)}|nlm\\rangle$ is proportional to a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $C_{lm;kq}^{l'm'}$. For our transition ($l=0, m=0$ to $l'=1$), the coefficients $C_{00;1q}^{1m'}$ are non-zero only if $m'=q$, and their values are all 1. This means the magnitude of the matrix element is the same for each final $m'$ state.\n    *   Since there are three possible final states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) and the probabilities are equal, the probability of transitioning to any one of them must be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   So, the probability of the first step being $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Likewise, the probability for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$, and for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle$ is also $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Analyze the second transition's probability:**\n    *   Once the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it will decay further. The only dipole-allowed transition to the $n=1$ shell is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. All other decays (e.g., to other shells) are either forbidden or have much smaller probabilities. Therefore, the probability of the second step, e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$, is essentially 1 (or 100%).\n\n7.  **Calculate the total probability for a given path:**\n    *   The total probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   For the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n        $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle)$\n        $P = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n8.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

This transition involves a change in the principal quantum number $\\Delta n = 1 - 3 = -2$ and no change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$.\n\n2.  **Recall Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions:**\n    Electric dipole transitions are the most common type of radiative transitions in atoms. The selection rules for an E1 transition between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer.\n\n3.  **Check for a Single-Step Transition:**\n    A direct, single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ would have $\\Delta l = 0$. This violates the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. Therefore, a single-photon electric dipole transition is forbidden.\n\n4.  **Consider a Two-Step Transition (Cascade):**\n    The problem states that the decay occurs via *two* dipole transitions. This implies a cascade process through an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    The process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{photon 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{photon 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n    We must apply the E1 selection rules to both steps of the cascade.\n\n    *   **Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Energy conservation: For a decay (photon emission), the energy must decrease. The energy of a state is $E_n \\propto -1/n^2$. So, the intermediate state must have lower energy than the initial state ($E_{n'} < E_3$), which means $n' < 3$.\n        *   Also, the intermediate state must be able to decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$, so its energy must be higher than the ground state ($E_{n'} > E_1$), which means $n' > 1$.\n        *   Combining these, the only possible value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule: $l' = l \\pm 1 = 0 \\pm 1 = 1$. So, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule: $m' = m + \\Delta m = 0 + (0, \\pm 1)$. So, the possible values for the magnetic quantum number are $m' = -1, 0, 1$.\n        *   Thus, the possible intermediate states are the three states of the 2p subshell: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Step 2: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   Let's verify that this second transition is allowed for all possible intermediate states.\n        *   Initial state: $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. Final state: $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible values of $m'$ (i.e., for $m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n        *   So, all three states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are valid intermediate states.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. Since there are three possible routes (via $m'=-1$, $m'=0$, or $m'=1$), we need to find the relative probability of each path. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first step of the decay.\n\n    The probability of a transition from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\vec{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d}=-e\\vec{r}$ is the electric dipole operator.\n\n    We are interested in the relative probabilities of the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   The three final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate in the absence of external fields.\n    *   Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state and the isotropy of space (no external fields), there is no reason for the atom to prefer decaying to one $m'$ state over another.\n    *   More formally, using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, one can show that the transition matrix elements for the transitions $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$ have a magnitude that is independent of $m'$. This means the transition rates to each of the three $m'$ states are equal.\n\n    Let $P$ be the transition rate to one specific state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$. Then the rates to $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ are also $P$. The total transition rate from the 3s state to the 2p subshell is $P_{total} = P + P + P = 3P$.\n\n    The probability (or branching ratio) for the decay to proceed through the specific intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is the ratio of the rate for that path to the total rate:\n    $$ \\text{Prob(via } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{P}{P_{total}} = \\frac{P}{3P} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n    Similarly, the probability for the decay to proceed via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is $1/3$, and via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is also $1/3$.\n\n7.  **Match with the Given Options:**\n    Let's examine the options provided:\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n\n    Our calculation shows that the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is a valid cascade, and the probability of this specific path being taken is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches option A perfectly. The other options list valid routes but with incorrect probabilities.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the Process and States**\n-   Initial state: $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$. This is the 3s state of the hydrogen atom.\n-   Final state: $|n, l, m\\rangle = |1, 0, 0\\rangle$. This is the 1s ground state.\n-   Transition mechanism: Two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n\n**2. Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules**\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole transition from a state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ to $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ are:\n-   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n-   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n-   $\\Delta n$ can be any non-zero integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State**\nLet the intermediate state be $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First transition: $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$**\n    -   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ to the initial state with $l=0$: $l_i - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l_i$ must be non-negative, we must have $l_i = 1$. The intermediate state must be a p-state.\n    -   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ to the initial state with $m=0$: $m_i - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are $m_i = -1, 0, 1$.\n    -   For a decay, we need $n_i < n=3$. So, $n_i$ could be 1 or 2.\n    -   However, the quantum number $l$ must be less than $n$ ($l \\le n-1$). Since $l_i=1$, we must have $n_i \\ge l_i+1 = 2$.\n    -   Combining these conditions ($n_i<3$ and $n_i\\ge 2$), the only possible principal quantum number for the intermediate state is $n_i = 2$.\n    -   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Second transition: $|2, 1, m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$**\n    -   Let's check if a transition from our determined intermediate states to the final state is allowed.\n    -   Initial (intermediate) state: $l_i=1$. Final state: $l_f=0$. So $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    -   Initial (intermediate) state: $m_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. Final state: $m_f=0$. So $\\Delta m = 0 - m_i = -m_i$. This is $0, \\mp 1$, which is allowed for all three values of $m_i$.\n    -   Initial (intermediate) state: $n_i=2$. Final state: $n_f=1$. So $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    -   Thus, all three states $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$ can decay to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n\nThe overall decay proceeds via one of these three routes (cascades):\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4. Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\nThe probability of the atom taking a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, since the second step is the only possible decay channel for the 2p state (it cannot decay to 2s, and higher states are not accessible via decay).\n\nThe transition rate for spontaneous emission is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n$A(i \\rightarrow f) \\propto |\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = e^2 (|\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2)$\n\nWe need to calculate this for the first transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_i\\rangle$. The radial part of the integral will be the same for all three values of $m_i$. We only need to compare the angular parts.\n\nA key principle of quantum mechanics (related to the Wigner-Eckart theorem and spherical symmetry) is that the decay of a spherically symmetric state (like any s-state, with $l=0$) into the different magnetic sublevels of a higher-$l$ state occurs with equal probability. The $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state has no preferred direction in space, so there is no reason for it to preferentially decay to one $m_i$ state over another.\n\nLet's verify this with a calculation. The transition rate to a specific final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ from an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ is given by the sum of squares of the matrix elements for the components of the dipole operator $\\mathbf{r}$.\nLet $I_{rad}$ be the common radial integral.\n-   **For the transition to $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$:** The selection rule for the $z$ operator ($z = r \\cos\\theta$) is $\\Delta m = 0$. The rules for $x$ and $y$ operators are $\\Delta m = \\pm 1$. So only the $\\langle z \\rangle$ matrix element is non-zero.\n    $A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\propto |\\langle 2,1,0 | z | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$. Calculation shows the angular part squared is $1/3$. So, $A \\propto |I_{rad}|^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n-   **For the transition to $|2, 1, \\pm 1\\rangle$:** Only the $\\langle x \\rangle$ and $\\langle y \\rangle$ matrix elements are non-zero.\n    $A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,\\pm 1\\rangle) \\propto |\\langle 2,1,\\pm 1 | x | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,\\pm 1 | y | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$. Calculation shows this sum is $|I_{rad}|^2 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6}) = |I_{rad}|^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSo, the transition rates for all three possible intermediate states are equal:\n$A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\nThe total decay rate from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is the sum of these three rates. The probability (or branching ratio) for decaying into any one specific intermediate state is:\n$P(\\text{via } |2,1,m_i\\rangle) = \\frac{A_m}{A_{-1} + A_0 + A_1} = \\frac{A_0}{A_0 + A_0 + A_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSo, each of the three possible cascade routes has a probability of $1/3$.\n\n**5. Match with the Options**\nWe now check which of the given options is consistent with our findings.\n-   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n-   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n-   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect. (Assuming the typo `\\rangle` means $|3,0,0\\rangle$).\n-   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This states a correct possible route with the correct probability.\n\nAlthough there are three possible routes, each with probability 1/3, option D is the only choice that presents a factually correct statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step decay (a cascade) of a hydrogen atom from the excited state |n=3, l=0, m=0> to the ground state |n=1, l=0, m=0> through an intermediate state. The decay occurs via two electric dipole transitions.\n\n2.  **Recall the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:**\n    For a transition from an initial state |n, l, m> to a final state |n', l', m'>, the following rules must be obeyed:\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number, Δn = n' - n, can be any integer. For decay, n' < n.\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl = l' - l, must be ±1.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = m' - m, must be 0 or ±1.\n\n3.  **Determine the possible intermediate states:**\n    Let the intermediate state be |n_int, l_int, m_int>.\n    *   **Step 1: |3,0,0> → |n_int, l_int, m_int>**\n        *   Initial state: l=0, m=0.\n        *   Applying the selection rule Δl = ±1, the intermediate state must have l_int = l + 1 = 1 (since l cannot be negative).\n        *   Applying the selection rule Δm = 0, ±1, the intermediate state can have m_int = m + Δm = 0 + (0, ±1), so m_int can be 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   The principal quantum number must decrease. The options suggest that the intermediate state has n_int = 2. This is a valid decay (3 → 2).\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,-1>.\n\n    *   **Step 2: |n_int, l_int, m_int> → |1,0,0>**\n        *   Intermediate state: l_int = 1, m_int ∈ {1, 0, -1}.\n        *   Final state: l_final = 0, m_final = 0.\n        *   Let's check if this transition is allowed for all possible intermediate states:\n            *   Δl = l_final - l_int = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n            *   Δm = m_final - m_int = 0 - m_int.\n                *   If m_int = 1, Δm = -1 (allowed).\n                *   If m_int = 0, Δm = 0 (allowed).\n                *   If m_int = -1, Δm = +1 (allowed).\n        *   So, all three routes proposed in options A, B, and C are physically possible according to the selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability of each transition route:**\n    The overall process is a cascade: |3,0,0> → |2,1,m_int> → |1,0,0>. The \"probability\" of a specific route refers to the branching ratio of the first step, i.e., the probability that the atom decays into that specific intermediate state. The second step is then a necessary consequence of being in that intermediate state.\n\n    We need to find the relative transition rates (and thus probabilities) for the first step:\n    *   Route A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1>\n    *   Route B: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0>\n    *   Route C: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>\n\n    The transition rate Γ for spontaneous emission from an initial state |i> to a final state |f> is given by Fermi's Golden Rule and is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the electric dipole operator **d** = e**r**:\n    $Γ_{i→f} ∝ |⟨f|e\\textbf{r}|i⟩|^2$\n    When averaged over all emission directions and polarizations, the rate is proportional to the sum of the squares of the matrix elements for the x, y, and z components:\n    $Γ_{i→f} ∝ |⟨f|ex|i⟩|^2 + |⟨f|ey|i⟩|^2 + |⟨f|ez|i⟩|^2$\n\n    A key insight comes from the symmetry of the initial state. The state |3,0,0> has l=0, meaning its wavefunction is spherically symmetric (the spherical harmonic Y_{0,0} is a constant). Because the initial state has no preferred direction in space, the probability of the atom emitting a photon and transitioning to a final state should be independent of the orientation of the final state's angular momentum. The quantum number 'm' represents the projection of the angular momentum onto the z-axis. Therefore, the probabilities of transitioning to the final states |2,1,1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,-1> must be equal.\n\n    Since these are the only three possible outcomes for the first decay step (to a state with l=1), their probabilities must sum to 1.\n    Let P(m_int) be the probability of transitioning to the state with magnetic quantum number m_int.\n    P(1) + P(0) + P(-1) = 1\n    Since P(1) = P(0) = P(-1) due to symmetry, we have:\n    3 * P(m_int) = 1\n    P(m_int) = 1/3\n\n    So, the probability for each of the three possible first steps is 1/3.\n    *   Probability of route via |2,1,1> is 1/3.\n    *   Probability of route via |2,1,0> is 1/3.\n    *   Probability of route via |2,1,-1> is 1/3.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and probability 1/4. The route is correct, but the calculated probability is 1/3. So, A is incorrect.\n    *   B) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and probability 1/3. The route is correct, and the calculated probability is 1/3. So, B is correct.\n    *   C) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and probability 1/4. The route is correct, but the calculated probability is 1/3. So, C is incorrect.\n    *   D) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and probability 2/3. The route is correct, but the calculated probability is 1/3. So, D is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability is B.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The calculation based on the spherical symmetry of the initial l=0 state is robust. A detailed calculation of the matrix elements confirms that the transition rates to the m=+1, m=0, and m=-1 sublevels of the l=1 state are indeed identical, leading to a 1/3 branching ratio for each.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a decay from the hydrogen atom state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. It explicitly states that this occurs via \"two dipole transition\", which implies a cascade decay involving an intermediate state. The process is:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{dipole transition 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{dipole transition 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State using Selection Rules:** We apply the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions to find the allowed intermediate state(s) $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    The selection rules are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   The principal quantum number $n$ must decrease for a decay process ($\\Delta n$ can be any integer).\n\n    *   **First Transition:** From $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   Since this is a decay, $n' < n_i = 3$. Also, for a given $n'$, we must have $l' < n'$. Since $l'=1$, the smallest possible $n'$ is 2. So, $n'$ must be 2.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** From an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed if $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which is true for all our possible intermediate states.\n        *   $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$. This is also an allowed decay.\n    *   **Conclusion on Routes:** All three intermediate states provide a valid decay path. The three possible routes are:\n        1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        The options A, B, and D all list valid routes. To distinguish between them, we must calculate the associated probabilities.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. In a cascade decay, this is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The atom in the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has three possible decay channels to the $n=2$ level. The probability of following a specific channel is the ratio of the partial decay rate for that channel to the total decay rate.\n\n    Branching Ratio for channel $m'$ = $\\frac{\\text{Rate}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m''=-1,0,1} \\text{Rate}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m''\\rangle)}$\n\n    The spontaneous emission rate (Einstein A coefficient) is proportional to the square of the dipole transition matrix element:\n    Rate $\\propto |\\langle n_f, l_f, m_f | e\\mathbf{r} | n_i, l_i, m_i \\rangle|^2$\n\n    We need to calculate this for the first transition: $|\\langle 2,1,m' | e\\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (it's an s-state, with $l=0$).\n    *   The final states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy in the non-relativistic H-atom model without external fields.\n    *   Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state and the interaction Hamiltonian (when averaged over all directions and polarizations of the emitted photon), the transition probability is independent of the final magnetic quantum number $m'$.\n\n    This can be shown formally using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element $\\langle n' l' m' | T_q^{(k)} | n l m \\rangle$ separates into a geometric part (a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient) and a physical part (the reduced matrix element), which is independent of the magnetic quantum numbers.\n    For a transition from $l=0$ to $l'=1$, the squared Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are identical for all three possible final states $m' = -1, 0, 1$.\n\n    Therefore, the transition rates to each of the three states are equal:\n    Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle$)\n\n    Let's call this rate $R$. The total rate is $R+R+R = 3R$.\n    The branching ratio for any specific channel $m'$ is:\n    Branching Ratio = $\\frac{R}{3R} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    Once the atom is in an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, it can only decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. So the probability of the second step is 1.\n    The overall probability for a given cascade path is thus the branching ratio of the first step, which is $1/3$.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our result.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is correct, but the probability is not.\n    *   C) Malformed option, but probability is $\\frac{2}{3}$. Incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is correct, but the probability is not.\n\n    Therefore, the only correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks for a possible decay path and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. The notation is $|n, l, m\\rangle$, representing the principal, orbital angular momentum, and magnetic quantum numbers, respectively.\n\n### **2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions**\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules, which dictate which transitions are \"allowed\". For a transition from an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ to a final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, the rules are:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0$ or $\\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n$, is not restricted by a selection rule, but for spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n### **3. Determine the Intermediate State(s)**\n\nThe decay is a two-step process:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nLet's find the quantum numbers of the allowed intermediate state(s) by applying the selection rules to both steps.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $|n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{int} - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l_{int} = 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{int} - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m_{int} = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n*   From the options provided, the intermediate principal quantum number is $n_{int}=2$. This is a valid decay since $2 < 3$.\n*   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Final state: $|n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n*   Let's check if the transitions from our possible intermediate states are allowed:\n    *   Intermediate state candidates: $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ where $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Applying the rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{int} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{int} = 0 - m_{int}$.\n            *   If $m_{int}=-1$, $\\Delta m = 1$. This is allowed.\n            *   If $m_{int}=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. This is allowed.\n            *   If $m_{int}=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   All three intermediate states lead to an allowed transition to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Thus, there are three possible decay routes:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### **4. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability corresponding to a given route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The atom starts in the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state and can decay into any of the three $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ states. We need to find the relative probability of these three initial decay channels.\n\n*   The transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the electric dipole operator, $\\mathbf{d}$.\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means its wave function is spherically symmetric. In such a case, there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   The electric dipole operator has components corresponding to the three possible changes in $m$:\n    *   $d_z \\propto r \\cos\\theta$ (for $\\Delta m = 0$)\n    *   $d_x \\pm i d_y \\propto r \\sin\\theta e^{\\pm i\\phi}$ (for $\\Delta m = \\pm 1$)\n*   Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state, the system has no preference for emitting a photon that changes $m$ by $-1, 0,$ or $+1$. Therefore, the transition probabilities to the three degenerate final states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$) must be equal.\n\n**Formal Argument (using Wigner-Eckart Theorem):**\nThe transition probability from $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is proportional to $|\\langle n'l'm'|\\mathbf{d}|nlm\\rangle|^2$. According to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, this matrix element can be separated into a physical part (the reduced matrix element) and a geometric part (the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient).\n\nFor the first transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n$P(m') \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m' | d_q | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,m' \\rangle|^2 \\cdot |\\langle 2,1 || d || 3,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nWhere $q=m'$. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$ are equal to 1 for all $m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$. The reduced matrix element $\\langle 2,1 || d || 3,0 \\rangle$ is independent of $m'$.\nTherefore, the probabilities are equal for all three transitions:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\nSince these are the only three possible intermediate states for the $n=2$ level, their probabilities must sum to 1. If there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability of each one is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   Prob (path via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$) = $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   Prob (path via $|2,1,0\\rangle$) = $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   Prob (path via $|2,1,1\\rangle$) = $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nThe second step of the cascade ($|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is guaranteed to happen once the atom is in the intermediate state, so the probability of the entire route is just the probability of the first step.\n\n### **5. Compare with Options**\n\nLet's review the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (**Correct** route and probability)\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only option that matches our analysis is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules:**\n    The problem describes a decay from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> (or |3,0,0>) to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0> (or |1,0,0>) via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n    The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n    *   Δn is not restricted but must change for emission/absorption. In this decay process, n decreases.\n\n2.  **Determine the First Transition Step:**\n    *   Initial state: |3,0,0>.\n    *   For the first transition, we apply the selection rules:\n        *   Δl = ±1: Since the initial l=0, the orbital quantum number of the intermediate state must be l'=1.\n        *   Δn < 0: The principal quantum number n must decrease. The lowest possible state with l=1 is n=2 (since l < n). So the intermediate state must have n'=2.\n        *   Δm = 0, ±1: Starting from m=0, the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate state, m', can be -1, 0, or +1.\n    *   Therefore, the first transition must be from |3,0,0> to one of the |2,1,m'> states, where m' can be -1, 0, or 1.\n    *   The problem implies the decay happens via the n=2 level as it is the only possible intermediate p-state (l=1) for a decay cascade from 3s.\n\n3.  **Determine the Second Transition Step:**\n    *   Intermediate state: |2,1,m'>.\n    *   Final state: |1,0,0>.\n    *   Let's check the selection rules for this step:\n        *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the Δl=±1 rule.\n        *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0 - m'. To satisfy the Δm=0, ±1 rule, m' must be -1, 0, or 1, which it is.\n    *   Thus, any of the intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1> can decay to the final state |1,0,0>. The transition route must be of the form |3,0,0> -> |2,1,m'> -> |1,0,0>. This confirms that the routes presented in options A, C, and D are all physically allowed.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    We now need to find the probability of a specific cascade occurring. This is a product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step (P₁):**\n        The initial state |3,0,0> is a 3s state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external polarizing fields, there is no preferred direction of decay. Therefore, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into each of the available final m' sublevels.\n        The possible final states for the first step are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. There are three such states.\n        The 3s state can only decay via E1 to a p-state. The only energetically accessible p-state is the 2p state (|2,1,m'>). Therefore, the total probability of decay from 3s to 2p is 1. This probability is split equally among the three m' sublevels.\n        So, the probability of decaying into any specific sublevel is:\n        P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = 1/3, for m' = -1, 0, 1.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step (P₂):**\n        The intermediate state is |2,1,m'> (a 2p state). It needs to decay to a lower energy state. According to E1 selection rules (Δl=±1), it can decay to an s-state (l=0) or a d-state (l=2). Since n must be less than 2, the only available state is the n=1 state, which requires l=0 (1s state, |1,0,0>). A 1d state does not exist.\n        Therefore, the 2p state has only one possible E1 decay channel: the 1s state.\n        This means that once the atom is in any |2,1,m'> state, it will decay to |1,0,0> with a probability of 1.\n        P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) = 1, for m' = -1, 0, 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability of a specific cascade:**\n        The total probability for a specific route is P_total = P₁ * P₂.\n        Let's calculate this for the route given in option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>.\n        P_total = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) * P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>)\n        P_total = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{3}. This matches our calculation. The route is valid and the probability is correct.\n    *   B) Route is garbled, but the probability of 2/3 is incorrect for a single cascade path.\n    *   C) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}. The route is valid, but the calculated probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n    *   D) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}. The route is valid, but the calculated probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial and final states and the process:**\n    *   Initial state: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This corresponds to the 3s orbital of the hydrogen atom.\n    *   Final state: $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. This is the ground state, the 1s orbital.\n    *   Process: The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|int\\rangle$. The path is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |int\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:**\n    The selection rules for quantum numbers $(n, l, m)$ in an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer change (for decay, $\\Delta n < 0$).\n\n3.  **Determine the possible intermediate state(s):**\n    *   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |int\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state has $l=0$. According to the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n        *   Since it is a decay, the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n        *   For a valid hydrogen atom state, we must have $l' < n'$. Since $l'=1$, the smallest possible value for $n'$ is 2. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n        *   A transition to $n'=1$ is not possible for the first step, because if $n'=1$, then $l'$ must be 0. This would violate the $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   For the magnetic quantum number, the initial state has $m=0$. The selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ means that $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, so $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n        *   Combining these findings, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. These correspond to the 2p subshell.\n\n    *   **Second transition: $|int\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state for this step has $l'=1$ and the final state has $l_f=0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is an allowed transition.\n        *   The final state has $m_f=0$. Let's check the $\\Delta m$ rule for each possible intermediate state:\n            *   From $|2,1,1\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - 1 = -1$. Allowed.\n            *   From $|2,1,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$. Allowed.\n            *   From $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$. Allowed.\n        *   Therefore, all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. In fact, the 2p state's only allowed dipole decay channel is to the 1s state.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. Since the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ must proceed through one of the three $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the probability of a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the probability of populating a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\n    The transition rate from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment: $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    We need to compare the rates of transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay process cannot have a preferred orientation for the resulting angular momentum of the atom. This physical intuition implies that the three final states $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, which are distinguished only by their orientation in space (the value of $m'$), must be populated with equal probability.\n\n    A more formal argument using the Wigner-Eckart theorem shows that the transition probability from an unpolarized $l=0$ state to an $l'=1$ state is independent of the final magnetic quantum number $m'$. The matrix elements for these transitions are proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$, which are all equal to 1. Thus, the transition rates are equal:\n    $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle)$.\n\n    Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the intermediate state, the probability for any single one is $1/3$.\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it will decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state with probability 1 (since this is the only available dipole decay channel).\n    Therefore, the probability of the entire cascade following a specific route is simply the probability of the first step. For the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, the probability is $1/3$.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (**Correct route and probability**)\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0>. This decay occurs via two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means there must be an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Recall Dipole Transition Selection Rules:** For an electric dipole transition between states |n,l,m> and |n',l',m'>, the following selection rules must be obeyed:\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number, Δn = n' - n, can be any integer.\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl = l' - l, must be ±1.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = m' - m, must be 0 or ±1.\n\n3.  **Determine Possible Intermediate States (First Transition):**\n    *   Initial state: |3,0,0> (n=3, l=0, m=0).\n    *   For the first E1 transition, l must change by ±1. Since l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n    *   The principal quantum number n must decrease for a decay. A common intermediate state would be n'=2. So the intermediate state is of the form |2,1,m'>.\n    *   For the magnetic quantum number m, the change Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = m' must be 0, ±1.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are:\n        *   |2,1,0> (for Δm=0)\n        *   |2,1,1> (for Δm=+1)\n        *   |2,1,-1> (for Δm=-1)\n\n4.  **Verify the Second Transition:**\n    *   From each possible intermediate state |2,1,m'>, we check if a transition to the final state |1,0,0> is allowed.\n    *   Final state: |1,0,0> (n=1, l=0, m=0).\n    *   Consider the transition from |2,1,m'> to |1,0,0>:\n        *   Δn = 1-2 = -1 (allowed).\n        *   Δl = 0-1 = -1 (allowed).\n        *   Δm = 0-m'. For this to be allowed, m' must be 0 or ±1. All three of our possible intermediate states satisfy this.\n    *   So, all three routes are possible:\n        *   Route 1: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n        *   Route 2: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n        *   Route 3: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios) for Each Route:**\n    The probability of a particular cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, assuming the intermediate state has only one significant decay channel (which is the case here, decaying to |1,0,0>).\n    The branching ratio B(i→f) is the ratio of the rate of a specific transition Γ(i→f) to the total decay rate from the initial state, Γ_tot(i).\n    B(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) / Γ_total\n\n    The total decay rate from |3,0,0> is the sum of the rates to the three possible intermediate states:\n    Γ_total = Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>) + Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>) + Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>)\n\n    The spontaneous emission rate Γ is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, |<f|**r**|i>|².\n    Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) ∝ |<2,1,m'| **r** |3,0,0>|²\n\n    We need to calculate the relative values of these matrix elements. The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (l=0). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay must be isotropic, meaning the probability of populating each of the m' sublevels of the l'=1 state must be equal.\n\n    Let's verify this with a calculation. The rate is proportional to:\n    *   For m'=0: |<2,1,0|z|3,0,0>|²\n    *   For m'=1: |<2,1,1|x|3,0,0>|² + |<2,1,1|y|3,0,0>|²\n    *   For m'=-1: |<2,1,-1|x|3,0,0>|² + |<2,1,-1|y|3,0,0>|²\n\n    The calculation using spherical harmonics (as detailed in the thought process) shows that these three quantities are equal. The radial part of the integral is common to all three, and the angular part gives:\n    *   Rate(→ m'=0) ∝ (1/3) × |Radial Integral|²\n    *   Rate(→ m'=1) ∝ (1/6 + 1/6) × |Radial Integral|² = (1/3) × |Radial Integral|²\n    *   Rate(→ m'=-1) ∝ (1/6 + 1/6) × |Radial Integral|² = (1/3) × |Radial Integral|²\n\n    Since the rates are equal, let's call the rate for each channel Γ_0.\n    Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>) = Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>) = Γ_0\n    The total rate is Γ_total = Γ_0 + Γ_0 + Γ_0 = 3Γ_0.\n\n    The branching ratio for any specific route, say via |2,1,0>, is:\n    B = Γ_0 / (3Γ_0) = 1/3.\n\n    Thus, each of the three possible routes has a probability of 1/3.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4. Incorrect probability.\n    *   B) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 1/3. This matches our result.\n    *   C) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 2/3. Incorrect probability.\n    *   D) |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4. Incorrect probability.\n\n    The only correct option is B.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition Process:**\n    The problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |3,0,0> to the final state |1,0,0> via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it |n', l', m'>. The decay cascade looks like this:\n    |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules:**\n    Electric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m:\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n    *   Δn is not restricted (but for a decay, energy must decrease, so n must decrease).\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **First Transition:** |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩\n        *   The initial state has l=0. To satisfy Δl=±1, the intermediate state must have l'=1.\n        *   The initial state has m=0. To satisfy Δm=0, ±1, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   For a decay process, the energy of the atom must decrease. The energy of a state |n,l,m> depends only on n (E_n = -E_R/n², where E_R is the Rydberg energy). So, we need E_n' < E₃, which implies n' < 3.\n        *   Since l'=1, the principal quantum number n' must be at least 2 (as for a given n, l can range from 0 to n-1).\n        *   Combining n'<3 and n'≥2, the only possible value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is n'=2.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n        *   The initial state has l'=1 and the final state has l=0. This satisfies Δl = -1, which is an allowed E1 transition.\n        *   The final state has m=0. The possible transitions from the intermediate m' states are:\n            *   m'= -1 → m=0 (Δm = +1, allowed)\n            *   m'= 0 → m=0 (Δm = 0, allowed)\n            *   m'= 1 → m=0 (Δm = -1, allowed)\n        *   All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0⟩.\n\n4.  **Determine the Transition Routes and Probabilities:**\n    We have established three possible decay routes, distinguished by the magnetic quantum number m' of the intermediate |2,1,m'⟩ state:\n    *   Route 1: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n    *   Route 2: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n    *   Route 3: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n    The question asks for the probability of a given route. This refers to the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the probability that the decay from |3,0,0> proceeds to a specific |2,1,m'> state.\n\n    The transition rate Γ from an initial state |i⟩ to a final state |f⟩ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element: Γ ∝ |⟨f| **d** |i⟩|², where **d** is the electric dipole operator.\n\n    The initial state |3,0,0> has l=0, which means its wavefunction is spherically symmetric. In spontaneous decay into an isotropic vacuum, there is no preferred direction. The three intermediate states |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩ are degenerate in energy and correspond to different orientations of the orbital angular momentum. Due to the rotational symmetry of the situation, the decay rates to these three states must be equal.\n\n    A more formal argument using the Wigner-Eckart theorem confirms this: the transition rate from an |n,l,m⟩ state to an |n',l',m'⟩ state depends on the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. For a transition from any |n,0,0⟩ state to an |n',1,m'⟩ state, the relevant squared Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are all equal to 1. Since the rest of the terms in the rate calculation (radial integral, frequency) are independent of m', the transition rates are identical:\n    Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)\n\n    Since these are the only three possible outcomes for the first decay step, their probabilities must sum to 1. As the rates are equal, their probabilities must be equal:\n    P(-1) = P(0) = P(1)\n    P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1\n    3 * P(0) = 1  => P(0) = 1/3\n\n    So, the probability for the atom to decay into any specific m' intermediate state is 1/3. The probability of the second step (|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) is 1, as this is the only E1 decay channel available to the |2p⟩ state. Therefore, the overall probability for any of the three complete routes is 1/3.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation.\n    *   B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is correct, but the probability is wrong.\n    *   C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is correct, but the probability is wrong. (Assuming typo in the option's initial state).\n    *   D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is correct, but the probability is wrong.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a possible route and its corresponding probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThis problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the state |n=3, l=0, m=0> to the ground state |n=1, l=0, m=0> through a two-step process, where each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. We need to determine the correct intermediate state and the probability (branching ratio) of that specific decay path.\n\n### 1. Electric Dipole (E1) Transition Selection Rules\nFor a transition to be allowed under the E1 approximation, the quantum numbers must change according to these rules:\n- **Principal quantum number (n):** Δn = any integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), n must decrease.\n- **Orbital angular momentum quantum number (l):** Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1.\n- **Magnetic quantum number (m):** Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Decay Path\nThe decay proceeds in two steps:\n|3,0,0>  →  |n',l',m'>  →  |1,0,0>\n\n**Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0> to the intermediate state |n',l',m'>**\n- **Initial state:** |i> = |3,0,0> (n=3, l=0, m=0).\n- **Applying Δl = ±1:** The intermediate state must have l' = l ± 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 (since l cannot be negative).\n- **Applying Δm = 0, ±1:** The intermediate state must have m' = m + Δm = 0 + Δm, so m' can be 0, 1, or -1.\n- **Applying Δn < 0:** The intermediate state must have n' < 3.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state |n',l',m'> to |1,0,0>**\n- **Final state:** |f> = |1,0,0> (n=1, l=0, m=0).\n- **Applying Δl = ±1:** The intermediate state must have l' = l_final ± 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. This is consistent with the result from Step 1.\n- **Applying Δn < 0:** The intermediate state must have n' > n_final = 1.\n\n**Combining the conditions for the intermediate state |n',l',m'>:**\n- From Step 1, n' < 3.\n- From Step 2, n' > 1.\n- The only integer n' that satisfies 1 < n' < 3 is n'=2.\n- We also know that l'=1 and m' can be -1, 0, or 1.\n\nTherefore, there are three possible intermediate states, and consequently, three possible decay routes:\n1.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n2.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n3.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n\nAll routes listed in the options are valid based on the selection rules. The next step is to determine the probability.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe overall probability of a specific cascade is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>. The transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element |<n',l',m'| **r** |n,l,m>|².\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0> is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric (l=0). When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, it has an equal probability of transitioning to each of the available magnetic sublevels (m') of the final state, as there is no preferred direction in space.\nThe available final states for the first step are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. Since there are three equally probable destination states, the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them.\n\n- Probability(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n- Probability(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n- Probability(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n\nThe python code in the thinking process confirms this result using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which formally describe the coupling of angular momenta. The code shows that the probability for each of the three channels is 1/3.\n\nSince the intermediate 2p states (|2,1,m'>) can only decay to the 1s state (|1,0,0>) via an E1 transition, the probability of the second step in the cascade is 1 once the atom reaches the intermediate state. Thus, the total probability for the cascade is simply the probability of the first step.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nLet's evaluate the given options based on our findings:\nA) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and Probability = 2/3. (Incorrect probability)\nB) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and Probability = 1/3. (Correct route and probability)\nC) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and Probability = 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\nD) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and Probability = 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only correct option is B.\n\nThe transition route is |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and the corresponding probability is \\frac{1}{3}.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition Path**\n    The problem describes a decay from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩ (the 3s state) to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0⟩ (the 1s state) through a two-step process involving electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state:\n    |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\n    The selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n    *   Δn = any integer (principal quantum number can change by any amount).\n    *   Δl = ±1 (orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by 1).\n    *   Δm = 0, ±1 (magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or 1).\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State |n', l', m'⟩**\n    *   **First transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩**\n        *   The initial state has l=0. To satisfy Δl = ±1, the intermediate state must have l'=1.\n        *   The decay process means energy is released, so the principal quantum number must decrease, i.e., n' < 3.\n        *   The combination n'=1, l'=1 is not possible, as for a given n, l must be less than n (l ≤ n-1).\n        *   Therefore, the only possible value for n' is 2. The intermediate state must have n'=2 and l'=1. This is the 2p state.\n        *   The initial state has m=0. To satisfy Δm = 0, ±1, the magnetic quantum number m' of the intermediate state can be m' = 0-1 = -1, m' = 0+0 = 0, or m' = 0+1 = 1.\n        *   So, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n    *   **Second transition: |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n        *   Let's verify that a transition from the |2,1,m'⟩ states to the final state |1,0,0⟩ is allowed.\n        *   The change in l is from l'=1 to l_final=0, so Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   The change in m depends on m'.\n            *   For |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, Δm = 0 - 0 = 0. Allowed.\n            *   For |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, Δm = 0 - 1 = -1. Allowed.\n            *   For |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, Δm = 0 - (-1) = +1. Allowed.\n        *   All three cascade routes are physically possible. The options provided in the question confirm this, listing these specific routes.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios for each step. For the route passing through the intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩, the probability is:\n    P(route via m') = BR(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩) × BR(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the second step (BR₂):** From any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, the only allowed E1 decay is to the |1,0,0⟩ state. There are no other lower-energy states to which it can decay via an E1 transition. Thus, the probability of this step occurring, given the atom is in the |2,1,m'⟩ state, is 1. So, BR(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = 1 for all m'.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the first step (BR₁):** The probability of the route is now simplified to the branching ratio of the first step:\n    P(route via m') = BR(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩)\n\n    The branching ratio for a specific channel is the decay rate for that channel divided by the total decay rate of the initial state.\n    BR(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩) / Γ_total(|3,0,0⟩)\n\n    The total decay rate is the sum of the rates to all possible final states:\n    Γ_total(|3,0,0⟩) = Γ(→ |2,1,-1⟩) + Γ(→ |2,1,0⟩) + Γ(→ |2,1,1⟩)\n\n    The transition rate Γ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, |⟨f|**d**|i⟩|². The key physical principle here is the isotropy of space. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (l=0). When such a state undergoes spontaneous emission into the vacuum (which is also isotropic, having no preferred direction), the probability of transitioning to any of the degenerate m' sub-levels of the final p-state is equal. This is a direct consequence of the Wigner-Eckart theorem.\n\n    Therefore, the transition rates are equal:\n    Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)\n\n    Let's call this rate G. Then the total rate is Γ_total = G + G + G = 3G.\n    The branching ratio for any specific route (e.g., via m'=0) is:\n    BR(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = G / (3G) = 1/3.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion**\n    The probability for each of the three possible routes is 1/3.\n    *   P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩) = 1/3\n    *   P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩) = 1/3\n    *   P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩) = 1/3\n\n    Now we compare this result with the given options:\n    A) ... and 1/4 (Incorrect)\n    B) ... |2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3 (Correct)\n    C) ... and 2/3 (Incorrect)\n    D) ... and 1/4 (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct option is the one that lists a valid route with the calculated probability of 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\nThe problem asks about the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n,l,m> = |3,0,0> (the 3s state) to the final state |1,0,0> (the 1s state). This decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. We need to identify a valid pathway and calculate its probability relative to all other possible two-dipole transition pathways.\n\n### 2. Applying Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n*   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n*   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n*   Δn can be any integer.\n\nA direct transition from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> is forbidden by the E1 selection rules because Δl = 0 - 0 = 0. Therefore, the process must go through an intermediate state, let's call it |n',l',m'>.\n\n### 3. Identifying the Intermediate State(s)\n\n#### First Transition: |3,0,0> → |n',l',m'>\n*   Initial state: n=3, l=0, m=0.\n*   Applying Δl = ±1: Since l=0, l' must be 1.\n*   Applying Δm = 0, ±1: Since m=0, m' can be 0, +1, or -1.\n*   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease, so n' < 3. The most probable intermediate state is the energetically lowest possible one, which is n'=2 (the options also point to n'=2).\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. These correspond to the three sublevels of the 2p orbital.\n\n#### Second Transition: |n',l',m'> → |1,0,0>\nLet's check if transitions from our possible intermediate states to the final state are allowed.\n*   Initial state: |2,1,m'> (with m' = -1, 0, or 1).\n*   Final state: |1,0,0>.\n*   Applying Δl = ±1: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n*   Applying Δm = 0, ±1: Δm = 0 - m'. This is allowed for m' = -1, 0, or 1.\n*   So, all three intermediate 2p states can decay to the 1s final state.\n\nThis confirms there are three possible routes for the cascade decay:\n1.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n2.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n3.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probabilities of the Routes\nThe probability of a specific route depends on the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the probability of the |3,0,0> state decaying into a specific |2,1,m'> sublevel.\n\nThe transition rate from an initial state `i` to a final state `f` is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, summed over all possible polarizations of the emitted photon:\nRate(i→f) ∝ |⟨f|**d**|i⟩|² = |⟨f|x|i⟩|² + |⟨f|y|i⟩|² + |⟨f|z|i⟩|²\n\nWe need to calculate the relative rates for the decay from |3,0,0> to each of the three |2,1,m'> states.\n\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state |3,0,0> has l=0, which means it is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay from this symmetric state into the three sublevels (m'=-1, 0, 1), which are only distinguished by their orientation in space, must occur with equal probability. This implies that each route has a probability of 1/3.\n\n*   **Explicit Calculation (using the Wigner-Eckart Theorem):**\n    The rate of transition from an initial state |nlm⟩ to a final state |n'l'm'⟩ is determined by the matrix element. The Wigner-Eckart theorem separates the matrix element's dependence on geometry (the m quantum numbers) from its overall strength (the reduced matrix element).\n\n    The rate for the transition |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'> is proportional to a constant C for each of the three possible values of m' (-1, 0, 1). Let the rate for each transition be R.\n    *   Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = R\n    *   Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>)  = R\n    *   Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>)  = R\n\n    The total rate of decay from |3,0,0> to any of the |2,1,m'> states is the sum:\n    Total Rate = R + R + R = 3R.\n\n    The probability (or branching ratio) for the system to take a specific path is the rate for that path divided by the total rate. For example, for the path through the m'=0 intermediate state:\n    Probability(m'=0 route) = Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) / Total Rate = R / (3R) = 1/3.\n\n    Similarly, the probability for the routes via m'=-1 and m'=1 are also 1/3.\n\n    For the second step of the decay (|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>), it is the only E1-allowed decay channel for the 2p state. Therefore, its probability is 1 (or the branching ratio is 100%).\n\n    The overall probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the probability of the first step.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe three possible routes via the intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> are all allowed and are equally probable, each with a probability of 1/3.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n*   C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3 (Correct route and probability)\n*   D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3 (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Process\nThe problem describes a two-step electric dipole (E1) transition for a hydrogen atom, cascading from the initial state |n,l,m> = |3,0,0> (also known as the 3s state) to the final state |1,0,0> (the 1s ground state) through an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Determine the Intermediate State using Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   **Δl = ±1**\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**\n\n**First transition: |3,0,0> → |n',l',m'>**\n*   The initial state has l=0. To satisfy Δl=±1, the intermediate state must have **l'=1**.\n*   The initial state has m=0. To satisfy Δm=0, ±1, the intermediate state can have **m' = 0, +1, or -1**.\n*   The problem implies a cascade decay, so the principal quantum number n must decrease. The only allowed n between 3 and 1 is **n'=2**.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are the sublevels of the 2p orbital: **|2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>**.\n\n**Second transition: |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\n*   The initial state for this step has l'=1. The final state has l''=0. The change is **Δl = 0 - 1 = -1**, which satisfies the selection rule.\n*   For the change in magnetic quantum number, Δm = m'' - m' = 0 - m'. This must be 0, ±1.\n    *   If m' = 0, Δm = 0 (allowed).\n    *   If m' = +1, Δm = -1 (allowed).\n    *   If m' = -1, Δm = +1 (allowed).\n*   All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0>.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of Each Transition Route\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio for that cascade path compared to all other possible two-step cascade paths to the ground state. The probability of a given cascade path through an intermediate state |m'> is proportional to the product of the transition rates (or strengths) for each step:\n\nProbability(route via m') ∝ Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) × Rate(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>)\n\nThe relative rates for these transitions can be determined using the Hönl-London factors, which give the relative strengths of spectral lines originating from the same initial level or ending on the same level. We will use the formulas from a standard text like Bethe and Salpeter's \"Quantum Mechanics of One- and Two-Electron Atoms\". The transition rate is proportional to a factor 'A' given by these formulas.\n\n**Step 1: Relative rates for |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>**\nThis is a transition from l=0, m=0 to l'=l+1=1. The formulas for the strength A(l,m → l+1,m') are:\n*   A(l,m → l+1, m-1) ∝ (l-m+1)(l-m+2)\n*   A(l,m → l+1, m)   ∝ 4(l-m+1)(l+m+1)\n*   A(l,m → l+1, m+1) ∝ (l+m+1)(l+m+2)\n\nApplying this for l=0, m=0:\n*   Rate(m'=-1): A(0,0 → 1,-1) ∝ (0-0+1)(0-0+2) = 2\n*   Rate(m'=0):   A(0,0 → 1,0)   ∝ 4(0-0+1)(0+0+1) = 4\n*   Rate(m'=+1): A(0,0 → 1,+1) ∝ (0+0+1)(0+0+2) = 2\n\nThe relative rates for populating the intermediate states m'=-1, 0, +1 are in the ratio **2 : 4 : 2**, or **1 : 2 : 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Relative rates for |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\nThis is a transition from an initial state with l=1 to a final state with l''=l-1=0 and m''=0. We need the rates from each m' sublevel to the final state. The formulas for A(l,m → l-1,m'') are:\n*   A(l,m → l-1, m-1) ∝ (l+m)(l+m-1)\n*   A(l,m → l-1, m)   ∝ 4(l+m)(l-m)\n*   A(l,m → l-1, m+1) ∝ (l-m)(l-m-1)\n\nApplying this for l=1, with various initial m values, all ending in m''=0:\n*   **From m'=-1:** We need the transition m→m+1 to get to m''=0. A(1,-1 → 0,0) ∝ (l-m)(l-m-1) = (1-(-1))(1-(-1)-1) = (2)(1) = 2.\n*   **From m'=0:** We need the transition m→m. A(1,0 → 0,0) ∝ 4(l+m)(l-m) = 4(1+0)(1-0) = 4.\n*   **From m'=+1:** We need the transition m→m-1. A(1,1 → 0,0) ∝ (l+m)(l+m-1) = (1+1)(1+1-1) = (2)(1) = 2.\n\nThe relative rates for the second decay step, from the states m'=-1, 0, +1, are also in the ratio **2 : 4 : 2**, or **1 : 2 : 1**.\n\n### 4. Combine Probabilities and Normalize\nNow we find the unnormalized probability for each full cascade route by multiplying the relative strengths from each step.\n\n*   **Route via |2,1,-1>:** Prob ∝ (Rate 1) × (Rate 2) = 1 × 1 = 1\n*   **Route via |2,1,0>:**  Prob ∝ (Rate 1) × (Rate 2) = 2 × 2 = 4\n*   **Route via |2,1,1>:**   Prob ∝ (Rate 1) × (Rate 2) = 1 × 1 = 1\n\nThe total relative probability for all three routes is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\nNow we normalize to find the final probabilities:\n*   P(Route via m'=-1) = 1/6\n*   P(Route via m'=0)  = 4/6 = **2/3**\n*   P(Route via m'=+1) = 1/6\n\n### 5. Final Answer\nWe compare these results with the given options:\n*   A) Route through |2,1,-1> with probability 1/4. (Our result is 1/6)\n*   B) Route through |2,1,0> with probability 2/3. (Our result is 2/3)\n*   C) Route through |2,1,0> with probability 1/3. (Our result is 2/3)\n*   D) Route through |2,1,1> with probability 1/4. (Our result is 1/6)\n\nThe calculation matches option B.\n\nThe transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ has a corresponding probability of $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes a two-step decay process from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩ via an intermediate state. The transitions are electric dipole transitions, which are governed by specific selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m:\n    *   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly 1.\n    *   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or 1.\n    *   **Δn is unrestricted**: The principal quantum number can change by any integer value, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so n must decrease.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State(s)**\n    Let the intermediate state be |n', l', m'⟩.\n    *   **First transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩**\n        *   Applying the Δl rule: l' - l = l' - 0 = ±1. So, the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n        *   For a decay, n' < n. So, n' must be less than 3. The possible values are n'=2 or n'=1.\n        *   If n'=1, then l' would have to be 0 (since for a given n, l can range from 0 to n-1). This would violate the Δl=±1 rule. Therefore, the intermediate state must have **n' = 2**.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, ±1. So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are **m' = 0, +1, or -1**.\n        *   Combining these, the possible intermediate states are the three degenerate 2p states: |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n    *   **Second transition: |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n        *   Let's check if a transition from our identified intermediate states |2,1,m'⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩ is allowed.\n        *   Applying the Δl rule: l_final - l' = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies Δl=±1.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: m_final - m' = 0 - m'. Since m' can be 0, +1, or -1, Δm can be 0, -1, or +1, respectively. All these are allowed.\n        *   Therefore, all three routes are physically possible:\n            1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n            2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n            3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n    The question asks for \"The transition route and the corresponding probability\". This refers to the branching ratio for a specific decay channel.\n    *   The initial state is |3,0,0⟩ (the 3s state). This state is spherically symmetric (l=0).\n    *   When a spherically symmetric state decays, the transition probabilities to each of the possible final magnetic sub-levels are equal. This is a consequence of the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which separates the geometry (m-dependence) from the dynamics.\n    *   In this case, the atom in the |3,0,0⟩ state can decay to any of the three |2,1,m'⟩ states. Since there is no preferred direction in the initial state, the probabilities for these three decay channels must be equal.\n    *   Total probability of decaying from |3,0,0⟩ to any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states is 1 (as this is the only allowed decay path). Since the three channels are equally likely, the probability for each is:\n        *   P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = 1/3\n        *   P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩) = 1/3\n        *   P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = 1/3\n    *   The second step of the decay is from the intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. The 2p state (|2,1,m'⟩) can only decay to the 1s state (|1,0,0⟩) via an electric dipole transition. Thus, once the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, it will decay to |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1.\n    *   The probability of a complete transition route is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route via |2,1,0⟩:\n        P(Route) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\n        P(Route) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options**\n    *   **A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3**: The route is valid, and the calculated probability is correct.\n    *   **B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4**: The route is valid, but the probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n    *   **C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n    *   **D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4**: The route is valid, but the probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that presents a valid route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\n\nThe problem asks about the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n, l, m> = |3, 0, 0> (the 3s state) to the final state |1, 0, 0> (the 1s ground state). The decay occurs via **two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions**. This means the atom decays from the initial state to an intermediate state, and then from that intermediate state to the final state. Each of these two steps involves the emission of one photon.\n\n### 2. Applying Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m:\n*   **Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly one unit.\n*   **Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or ±1. This corresponds to the polarization of the emitted photon (Δm = 0 for linear polarization along the z-axis, Δm = ±1 for circular polarization in the x-y plane).\n*   **Δn = n_final - n_initial**: The principal quantum number can change by any integer value, but for a decay (emission), n must decrease (Δn < 0).\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State\n\nLet the intermediate state be |n', l', m'>.\n\n*   **First transition: |3, 0, 0> → |n', l', m'>**\n    *   Applying the Δl = ±1 rule to the initial state l=0: l' must be 0 ± 1, so **l' = 1**. The intermediate state must be a p-orbital.\n    *   Applying the Δm = 0, ±1 rule to the initial state m=0: m' can be 0+0, 0+1, or 0-1. So, **m' can be 0, 1, or -1**.\n    *   For the principal quantum number n', since this is a decay, n' < 3. The most probable transition is to the lowest possible energy level that satisfies the other rules. The n=2 level is lower in energy than n=3. The options provided in the question all use n'=2 as the intermediate state, which is the intermediate step of the famous Balmer-alpha transition (3s → 2p). So, the intermediate state is of the form **|2, 1, m'>**.\n\n*   **Second transition: |n', l', m'> = |2, 1, m'> → |1, 0, 0>**\n    *   Let's check if this is allowed.\n    *   Applying the Δl = ±1 rule: The transition is from l'=1 to l_final=0. So Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is a valid transition.\n    *   Applying the Δm = 0, ±1 rule: The transition is from m' to m_final=0. So Δm = 0 - m'. This must be 0, ±1. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate m' values (0, 1, -1).\n\n### 4. Identifying Possible Transition Routes\n\nBased on the selection rules, there are three possible cascade routes from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> through the n=2 manifold:\n1.  `|3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>`\n2.  `|3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>`\n3.  `|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>`\n\nAll options A, B, C, and D present one of these valid routes. To find the correct answer, we must calculate the probability of each route.\n\n### 5. Calculating the \"Probability\" (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe \"probability\" in this context refers to the branching ratio: for all atoms starting in |3,0,0> that decay via this two-step cascade, what fraction will take a specific path?\n\n*   **Probability of the first step: |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>**\n    *   The initial state |3,0,0> is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred direction in space.\n    *   Due to this rotational symmetry, there is no preference for emitting a photon with Δm=+1, Δm=0, or Δm=-1. Therefore, the transitions to the three possible m' sublevels (|2,1,1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,-1>) are equally probable.\n    *   The decay from the 3s state to the 2p manifold is the dominant decay channel for the 3s state. We can assume the total probability of transitioning to *any* of the 2p states is 1.\n    *   Since the three m' states are equally likely, the probability (branching ratio) of transitioning into any *specific* m' state is **1/3**.\n        *   BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n        *   BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n        *   BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n\n*   **Probability of the second step: |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\n    *   Once the atom is in one of the intermediate states, say |2,1,0>, it must decay further.\n    *   The only state with n < 2 that is accessible via an E1 transition (Δl = ±1) from the |2,1,m'> (2p) state is the |1,0,0> (1s) state.\n    *   Therefore, the decay from the 2p state to the 1s state is the only available E1 decay path. This means the branching ratio for this step is **1**.\n        *   BR(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) = 1 (for m' = -1, 0, or 1).\n\n*   **Total Probability of a Cascade Route**\n    *   The total probability of a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   For the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>:\n        Probability = BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) × BR(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>) = (1/3) × 1 = **1/3**.\n    *   Similarly, the probability for the routes via |2,1,1> and |2,1,-1> is also 1/3 each.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nWe have determined that any of the three possible cascade paths has a probability of 1/3. Now we compare this with the given options:\n\n*   A) `|3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>` and probability `2/3`. (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) `|3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>` and probability `1/4`. (Incorrect probability)\n*   C) `|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>` and probability `1/4`. (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) `|3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>` and probability `1/3`. (**Correct** route and probability)\n\nTherefore, option D correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step decay process of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|\\psi_i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|\\psi_f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means there must be an intermediate state, $|\\psi_{int}\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Determine the intermediate state using selection rules:** The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any non-zero integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n    *   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n        *   $l_{initial} = 0$. So, $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n        *   $m_{initial} = 0$. So, $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, which means $m'$ can be $0, 1, -1$.\n        *   $n_{initial} = 3$. For decay, $n' < 3$. So $n'$ can be 1 or 2.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   $l_{final} = 0$. We must have had $l' = 1$ for this transition to be allowed ($\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$). This is consistent with the first transition.\n        *   $m_{final} = 0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$, which implies $m'$ can be $0, 1, -1$. This is also consistent.\n        *   $n_{final} = 1$. For decay, $n' > 1$.\n\n    *   **Combining the conditions:** The intermediate state must have $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$, and $1 < n' < 3$. This uniquely determines $n'=2$. So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. The decay must proceed through one of these three paths:\n        *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n3.  **Calculate the probability for each path:** The question asks for \"the corresponding probability\". In the context of multiple decay paths, this refers to the branching ratio: the probability of the decay occurring via a specific path, relative to all other possible paths for this process.\n\n    *   The probability of a specific path is determined by the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n    *   The probability of path $m'$ is $P(m') = BR(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m') \\times BR(2,1,m' \\to 1,0,0)$.\n\n    *   **Branching ratio for the second step:** Consider the state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. What are its possible E1 decay channels? The final state must have $l_{final} = 0$ or $l_{final} = 2$.\n        *   If $l_{final}=2$, then $n_{final} \\geq l_{final}+1=3$. Since decay requires $n_{final} < n'=2$, this is not possible.\n        *   If $l_{final}=0$, then $n_{final} \\geq l_{final}+1=1$. Decay requires $n_{final} < n'=2$, so the only possible final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Therefore, the decay from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the only possible E1 decay channel. This means the branching ratio for the second step is 1, regardless of $m'$.\n        *   $BR(2,1,m' \\to 1,0,0) = 1$ for $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n\n    *   **Branching ratio for the first step:** The probability of taking a specific path is now reduced to the branching ratio of the first step: $P(m') = BR(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$. The branching ratio is the ratio of the decay rate to the specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   $BR(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')}{\\sum_{m''=-1}^{1} \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m'')}$\n        *   The decay rate $\\Gamma(i \\to f)$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f |e\\mathbf{r}| i \\rangle|^2$.\n        *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the different magnetic substates $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ must be equally probable. The atom has an equal chance of emitting a photon with polarization corresponding to $\\Delta m = +1$, $\\Delta m = -1$, or $\\Delta m = 0$.\n        *   This can be confirmed by explicit calculation using the Wigner-Eckart theorem or by direct calculation of the matrix elements $\\langle 2,1,m'|x|3,0,0 \\rangle$, $\\langle 2,1,m'|y|3,0,0 \\rangle$, and $\\langle 2,1,m'|z|3,0,0 \\rangle$. The transition strength, summed over polarizations, is $|\\langle 2,1,m'|e\\mathbf{r}|3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$, which is found to be independent of $m'$.\n        *   Thus, $\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,1) = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,0) = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,-1)$.\n\n    *   **Final Probability:** Since the three possible paths of the first step have equal rates, their branching ratios are equal. As there are three paths, each must have a probability of $1/3$.\n        *   $BR(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m') = 1/3$ for each $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n        *   The overall probability for the decay to proceed via the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is $P(m') = (1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\n4.  **Match with options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

Both the transition route and the calculated probability match.\n\nThe transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition Process:**\n    The problem describes a decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ occurring via a cascade of two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state, and the decay happens in two steps:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Apply E1 Selection Rules for the First Transition:**\n    The selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   $\\Delta n = n' - n$ can be any integer.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n    For the first step, the initial state is $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l' - 0 = \\pm 1$, which means the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, so the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. In a hydrogen atom, we must have $l' < n'$. Since $l'=1$, we need $n' \\ge 2$. Combining these conditions, the only possible value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$.\n\n    Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply E1 Selection Rules for the Second Transition:**\n    The second step is the transition from an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. This condition must be satisfied.\n        *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$ (allowed).\n        *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$ (allowed).\n        *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = +1$ (allowed).\n    So, all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Furthermore, for a state in the $n=2, l=1$ manifold (the $2p$ level), the only possible E1 decay channel is to the $n=1, l=0$ state (the $1s$ ground state). This means that once the atom reaches any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability (or branching ratio) of 1.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Branching Ratios for the First Transition:**\n    The overall probability for a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, i.e., the probability of the atom in the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state decaying into a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    The probability of a transition from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the transition dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\vec{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d} = -e\\vec{r}$.\n\n    The branching ratio for the decay into a specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n    $B(m') = \\frac{|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\vec{d} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2}{\\sum_{m''=-1,0,1} |\\langle 2,1,m'' | \\vec{d} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2}$\n\n    We need to compare the magnitudes of the matrix elements for $m'=-1, 0, 1$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has a spherically symmetric wavefunction ($Y_{0,0}$ is a constant).\n    *   The electric dipole interaction, when averaged over all possible polarizations and directions of the emitted photon, is isotropic.\n    *   Therefore, there can be no preferred final state $m'$. The decay must populate the three possible final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ with equal probability.\n\n    More formally, using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the matrix element squared is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    $|\\langle 2,1,m' | d_q^{(1)} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,m' \\rangle|^2$.\n    This coefficient is non-zero only for $q=m'$, and its value is $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle = 1$ for all $m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n    This confirms that the transition rates to each of the three $m'$ sublevels are equal.\n\n    Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first decay step, the branching ratio for each is $1/3$.\n    $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Probability for Each Route:**\n    The total probability of a cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **Route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$**: $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   **Route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$**: $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   **Route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$**: $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,-1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$.

This is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step in the cascade.\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 1: $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2, 1, m'\\rangle$**\n        The initial state $|3, 0, 0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, when the atom decays by emitting a photon, there is an equal probability of it transitioning to any of the magnetic sublevels ($m'$) of the final energy level.\n        The possible final states for the first step are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$. Since there are three equally probable destination states, the probability (branching ratio) for transitioning to any one of them is $1/3$.\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 2: $|2, 1, m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$**\n        Once the atom is in one of the intermediate states, say $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, it will decay further. The only available energy level below the $n=2$ level is the $n=1$ level. The state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$. We have already established that the dipole transition $|2, 1, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$ is allowed. Since this is the only possible decay channel via a dipole transition to a lower energy state, the probability of this step occurring, given the atom is in the state $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, is 1. The same logic applies to the other intermediate states, $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$ and $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$.\n        *   $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$ for any $m'$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Overall Probability of the Route**\n    The total probability of a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    Let's evaluate the route given in option C: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Probability = $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    *   Probability = $(1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options**\n    *   A) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{2}{3}$.

Understand the Process and Selection Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a two-step photon emission process, where a hydrogen atom in the $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ state decays to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. The selection rules for an E1 transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n*   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   Change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   The principal quantum number $n$ must change ($\\Delta n \\neq 0$), and for decay (emission), energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n**2. Analyze the First Transition**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n*   **Intermediate state:** Let this be $|int\\rangle = |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n\nApplying the selection rules for the first transition:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{int} - l_i = l_{int} - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we have $l_{int} = 1$.\n*   $\\Delta n = n_{int} - n_i < 0 \\implies n_{int} < 3$. Since $l_{int}=1$, we must have $n_{int} \\geq 2$. So, the only possibility is $n_{int} = 2$.\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{int} - m_i = m_{int} - 0 = m_{int} = 0, \\pm 1$. So, $m_{int}$ can be $-1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n\nTherefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All options correctly identify one of these as part of a potential route.\n\n**3. Analyze the Second Transition**\n\n*   **Intermediate state:** $|int\\rangle = |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$.\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n\nApplying the selection rules for the second transition from any of the possible intermediate states:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_{int} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$.\n*   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_{int} = 0 - m_{int} = -m_{int}$. For this to be allowed, we need $-m_{int}$ to be in $\\{0, \\pm 1\\}$, which is true for all possible $m_{int} \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n*   $\\Delta n = n_f - n_{int} = 1-2 = -1$. This is an allowed decay.\n\nThus, all three decay routes are possible:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4. Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n\nThe probability of a particular decay path is the product of the branching ratios at each step.\n\n*   **Branching Ratio for the first step ($B_1$)**:\n    The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a $3s$ orbital), which is spherically symmetric. When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, the emission is isotropic (the same in all directions). This means there is no preferred orientation for the final state's angular momentum. As a result, the atom has an equal probability of landing in any of the available magnetic substates of the intermediate level. Since there are three possible intermediate states ($m_{int}=-1,0,1$), the probability of transitioning to any specific one is the same.\n    $B_1 = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each of $m_{int} \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n    (This can be formally shown using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, where the transition rate is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_i, m_i; 1, q | l_f, m_f \\rangle^2$. For the transition from $l=0$ to $l=1$, this coefficient's squared value is independent of the final $m_f$.)\n\n*   **Branching Ratio for the second step ($B_2$)**:\n    The atom is now in an intermediate state $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ (a $2p$ orbital). We need to find the probability that it will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's consider what other decay channels are available from the $2p$ state. According to the dipole selection rules, the atom can only decay to a state with $l=0$ or $l=2$. For energy to be released, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease ($n<2$). The only available state that meets these criteria is the $n=1, l=0$ state (the $1s$ ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$). There is no $n=1, l=2$ state.\n    Therefore, the decay from any $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ state *must* proceed to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.

Understand the Problem:**\nThe question asks about a two-step electric dipole transition in a non-relativistic Hydrogen atom. The atom decays from the initial state `|3,0,0>` to the final state `|1,0,0>` through an intermediate state. We need to identify a valid transition route and the probability associated with that specific path. The notation used is `|n, l, m>`, where `n` is the principal quantum number, `l` is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and `m` is the magnetic quantum number.\n\n**2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions:**\nFor a transition to be allowed under the electric dipole approximation, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be `Δl = ±1`.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be `Δm = 0, ±1`.\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, `Δn`, can be any integer (`Δn = 0, ±1, ±2, ...`).\n\n**3. Analyze the First Transition Step:**\nThe atom transitions from the initial state `|i⟩ = |3,0,0⟩` to an intermediate state `|int⟩ = |n',l',m'⟩`.\n*   **Initial State:** `n=3, l=0, m=0`.\n*   **Applying Selection Rules:**\n    *   `Δl = l' - l = l' - 0 = ±1`  implies that the intermediate state must have `l' = 1`.\n    *   `Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, ±1` implies that the intermediate state can have `m' = -1, 0, or 1`.\n*   The options provided suggest that the intermediate state has `n' = 2`. This is an allowed change (`Δn = 2 - 3 = -1`).\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,-1⟩`, `|2,1,0⟩`, and `|2,1,1⟩`.\n\n**4. Analyze the Second Transition Step:**\nThe atom transitions from the intermediate state `|int⟩ = |2,1,m'⟩` to the final state `|f⟩ = |1,0,0⟩`.\n*   **Intermediate State:** `n'=2, l'=1, m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}`.\n*   **Final State:** `n''=1, l''=0, m''=0`.\n*   **Applying Selection Rules:**\n    *   `Δl = l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1`. This satisfies the `Δl = ±1` rule.\n    *   `Δm = m'' - m' = 0 - m'`. For `Δm` to be `0` or `±1`, we require `m'` to be `0` or `±1`.\n*   This confirms that all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final `|1,0,0⟩` state. All the transition routes listed in the options are physically allowed.\n\n**5. Determine the Probability of Each Route:**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. In a cascade decay, the total process branches out at the first step. The probability of following a specific path is determined by the **branching ratio** of that first decay.\n\n*   The three possible first-step transitions are:\n    1.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩`\n    2.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩`\n    3.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩`\n\n*   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment `|<final|**d**|initial>|^2`. For spontaneous emission, we consider the rates for these three channels.\n\n*   A key physical insight is required here: The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` is an s-state, which is **spherically symmetric**. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. Since the atom in its initial state has no preferred direction, and spontaneous emission is an isotropic process (it occurs with equal probability in all directions), there can be no preference for which of the three `m'` sublevels of the `l'=1` state is populated.\n\n*   Therefore, the probabilities of decaying into each of the three `m'` states must be equal.\n    *   `P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)`\n\n*   Since these three paths are the only possible outcomes for the first decay (to the `n=2, l=1` manifold), their probabilities must sum to 1.\n    *   `P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1`\n    *   `3 × P(any single m') = 1`\n    *   `P(any single m') = 1/3`\n\n**6. Evaluate the Options:**\nNow we compare this calculated probability with the values given in the options.\n\n*   A) Route `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`. The probability for this route is `1/3`. The option gives `1/4`. **Incorrect.**\n*   B) Route `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`. The probability for this route is `1/3`. The option gives `2/3`. **Incorrect.**\n*   C) Route `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`. The probability for this route is `1/3`. The option gives `1/4`. **Incorrect.**\n*   D) Route `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`. The probability for this route is `1/3`. The option gives `1/3`. **Correct.**\n\nThe only option that presents a valid route with the correct corresponding probability is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. The problem states this happens via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means it is a cascade decay involving an intermediate state:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Dipole 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Dipole 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nA single-step transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is forbidden by the electric dipole selection rules, as we will see below.\n\n### 2. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nFor an electric dipole transition between an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number (l):** $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number (m):** $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number (n):** $\\Delta n$ can be any integer value ($\\Delta n = n' - n \\neq 0$). For a decay (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ (so $n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l' = 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $E_{n'} < E_3$. In the non-relativistic hydrogen atom, energy only depends on $n$: $E_n = -E_R/n^2$, where $E_R$ is the Rydberg energy. $E_{n'} < E_3$ means $-E_R/n'^2 < -E_R/3^2$, which simplifies to $1/n'^2 > 1/9$, or $n'^2 < 9$. This implies $n' < 3$. So possible values for $n'$ are 1 and 2.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Final state: $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$ (so $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$).\n*   The intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ is the initial state for this transition. We found above that $l'=1$ and $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This is satisfied for $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $E_{n'} > E_1$. This means $-E_R/n'^2 > -E_R/1^2$, which implies $1/n'^2 < 1$, or $n' > 1$.\n\n**Combining the conditions for n':**\nFrom the first transition, we found $n' \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\nFrom the second transition, we found $n' > 1$.\nThe only integer value that satisfies both conditions is $n' = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the intermediate state must be of the form $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$, where $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n### 4. Identifying the Possible Transition Routes\nBased on the allowed intermediate states, there are three possible cascade routes:\n*   **Route 1:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Route 2:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Route 3:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll the routes listed in options A, C, and D are valid possible pathways according to the selection rules.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the \"corresponding probability\". In the context of multiple decay paths, this refers to the branching ratio of the first transition. The total decay probability for the atom in the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to decay to the level $n=2$ is split among the three possible $m'$ sublevels of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state.\n\nThe transition probability from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$.\nFor the first transition, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric.\n*   Due to the rotational invariance of the electromagnetic interaction and the spherical symmetry of the initial state, there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   Therefore, the probability of decaying into any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ sublevels must be the same, regardless of the value of $m'$. This is a direct consequence of the Wigner-Eckart theorem.\n*   Since there are three possible and equally likely final states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$), the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them.\n\nSo, the branching ratio for each channel is:\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\nOnce the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it will decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state with probability 1 (as this is the only allowed E1 decay channel from the 2p state). Therefore, the probability associated with each entire cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n### 6. Comparing with the Options\nLet's check the given options:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    *   The route is valid.\n    *   The probability (branching ratio) is correct.\n\n*   **B) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    *   The initial state is missing (typographical error), but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid.\n    *   The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid.\n    *   The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\nOnly option A provides a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the state |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via two electric dipole transitions. We must follow the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:\n    *   Change in the principal quantum number, `n`: `Δn` can be any integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), `n` decreases.\n    *   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, `l`: `Δl = ±1`.\n    *   Change in the magnetic quantum number, `m`: `Δm = 0, ±1`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Initial, Intermediate, and Final States**\n    *   Initial state: `|i⟩ = |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩` (a `3s` state).\n    *   Final state: `|f⟩ = |n=1, l=0, m=0⟩` (a `1s` state).\n    *   The transition from `l=0` to `l=0` directly is forbidden because `Δl=0`. It must proceed through an intermediate state `|int⟩ = |n', l', m'⟩` in a two-step process:\n        `|3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n\n3.  **Determine the Properties of the Intermediate State**\n    *   **First Transition:** `|3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩`\n        *   `Δl = l' - l = l' - 0 = ±1`. Since `l'` must be non-negative, we must have `l' = 1`. The intermediate state must be a `p` state.\n        *   `Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = m'`. The selection rule is `Δm = 0, ±1`, so `m'` can be `0, 1, -1`.\n        *   The principal quantum number `n'` must be less than 3 for a decay process. The options provided suggest `n'=2`. So the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,0⟩`, `|2,1,1⟩`, and `|2,1,-1⟩`. These are the `2p` orbitals.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** `|n', l', m'⟩ = |2, 1, m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n        *   `Δl = l_final - l' = 0 - 1 = -1`. This satisfies the `Δl = ±1` rule.\n        *   `Δm = m_final - m' = 0 - m'`. This must be `0` or `±1`.\n        *   If `m' = 0`, then `Δm = 0`. Allowed.\n        *   If `m' = 1`, then `Δm = -1`. Allowed.\n        *   If `m' = -1`, then `Δm = 1`. Allowed.\n    *   So, all three potential intermediate states (`|2,1,0⟩`, `|2,1,1⟩`, `|2,1,-1⟩`) can decay to the final state `|1,0,0⟩`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Branching Ratios (Probabilities)**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio for that path compared to all other possible paths. The overall process is the cascade `3s → 2p → 1s`. We need to find the probability of the atom taking a specific intermediate `2p` state.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩`\n        The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` is a `3s` state, which is spherically symmetric (`l=0`). When it decays, there is no preferred direction in space (unless an external field is applied, which is not stated). Therefore, the emission process populates the three possible final `m'` states (`m'=-1, 0, 1`) with equal probability.\n        Let `W(i→f)` be the transition rate. The rates `W(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩)`, `W(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩)`, and `W(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩)` are equal due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state.\n        Let the total rate of decay from `3s` to `2p` be `W_{total}`.\n        `W_{total} = W(m'=-1) + W(m'=0) + W(m'=1)`\n        Since `W(m'=-1) = W(m'=0) = W(m'=1)`, the probability (branching ratio) of transitioning to any single `m'` state is:\n        `P(3s → 2p, specific m') = W(m') / W_{total} = 1/3`.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** `|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n        Once the atom is in an intermediate state, say `|2,1,0⟩`, it will decay again. The only dipole-allowed transition to a lower energy level is to the `|1,0,0⟩` (`1s`) state. (There are no `n=1, l=0` or `n=1, l=2` states to decay to). Therefore, the probability of this second step, given that the atom is in a `2p` state, is 1.\n        `P(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = 1` for any `m'`.\n\n    *   **Total Probability for a specific path**\n        The probability of a complete cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n        Let's take the path given in option A: `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`.\n        `P(path A) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)`\n        `P(path A) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   **A) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `1/3`**\n        This matches our calculation. The path is valid, and the probability (branching ratio) is correct.\n\n    *   **B) `... → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `2/3`**\n        The probability is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`**\n        The path is valid, but the probability should be `1/3`, not `1/4`.\n\n    *   **D) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`**\n        The path is valid, but the probability should be `1/3`, not `1/4`.\n\nTherefore, option A provides a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the process:**\nThe problem describes a cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through an intermediate state. The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. We need to determine the specific path (i.e., the intermediate state) and the probability of this path.\n\n**2. Apply Selection Rules for Dipole Transitions:**\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers $(n, l, m)$:\n*   **Parity change:** The parity of the state, given by $(-1)^l$, must change. This implies that $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial}$ must be an odd integer. For one-photon dipole transitions, the rule is more restrictive.\n*   **Orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Principal quantum number:** $\\Delta n$ can be any integer. For a decay (emission), $n$ must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State:**\nThe decay proceeds in two steps:\n*   **Step 1:** Initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ decays to an intermediate state $|int\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Step 2:** Intermediate state $|int\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$ decays to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nLet's apply the selection rules to both steps:\n*   **For Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   $l_i = 0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, we must have $l' = 1$.\n    *   $m_i = 0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, we can have $m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n    *   For decay, $n'$ must be less than $n_i=3$.\n*   **For Step 2 ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   $l_f = 0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$. This is consistent with what we found from Step 1.\n    *   $m_f = 0$. The intermediate state's magnetic quantum number $m'$ must satisfy $m_f - m' = 0 \\Rightarrow m'=0$ or $m_f - m' = \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow m' = \\mp 1$. So, $m'$ can be $0, 1, -1$.\n    *   For decay, $n'$ must be greater than $n_f=1$.\n\nCombining these conditions, the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ must have $1 < n' < 3$, which means $n'=2$. It must have $l'=1$, and $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$.\nSo, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\nAll the routes proposed in the options A, B, C, and D are valid possible routes for the cascade decay.\n\n**4. Calculate the Transition Probability:**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route, for example, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\nThe overall probability of a cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n$P_{cascade} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$\n    This is the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ into a specific substate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric ($Y_{0,0}$ is a constant). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the three degenerate sublevels of the $2p$ state: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n    The decay from the $3s$ state can only proceed to a $2p$ state via dipole transition (since $n$ must decrease and $l$ must become 1). There are no other allowed decay channels. So, the total probability of decaying to the $2p$ manifold is 1.\n    Since the three final substates are equally probable, the probability of decaying into any specific one is:\n    $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    Once the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it will decay further. We need to find the probability that it decays to $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    For an atom in the state $|2,1,0\\rangle$, the only state with lower energy it can decay to via an electric dipole transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the $1s$ ground state). The transition is allowed by the selection rules ($\\Delta l = -1, \\Delta m = 0$). Since this is the *only* possible dipole decay channel, the probability of this decay occurring is 1. An atom in the $2p$ state will certainly decay to the $1s$ state.\n    So, $P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$. The same logic applies to the states $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**5.

The probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step (Branching ratio for 3s → 2p):**\n        The initial state |3,0,0> is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric (l=0). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space (i.e., the choice of the z-axis is arbitrary). The decay process must reflect this symmetry. The three possible final states for this step, |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>, are the magnetic sublevels of the p-orbital (l=1). Due to the rotational symmetry of the initial state and the interaction, the probability of decaying into any of these three sublevels must be equal.\n        Therefore, the probability of decaying into any specific m' state is 1/3.\n        *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n        *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n        *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step (Branching ratio for 2p → 1s):**\n        Once the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'> states (the 2p level), it will decay to a lower energy state. The only available state with lower energy is the |1,0,0> ground state (1s). The transition from l=1 to l=0 is allowed by the dipole selection rules. Since this is the only possible decay channel, any atom that reaches the 2p level is guaranteed to decay to the 1s state.\n        Therefore, the branching ratio for this step is 1 (or 100%).\n        *   P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) = 1, for any m'.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.

The selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions are:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl, must be ±1. (Δl = l<sub>final</sub> - l<sub>initial</sub> = ±1)\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm, must be 0 or ±1. (Δm = m<sub>final</sub> - m<sub>initial</sub> = 0, ±1)\n    *   The principal quantum number, n, has no selection rule (Δn can be anything), but for a decay process (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, which means n must decrease in the non-relativistic hydrogen atom model where energy E<sub>n</sub> ∝ -1/n<sup>2</sup>.\n\n2.  **Determine the intermediate state.**\n    Let the intermediate state be denoted by |n', l', m'⟩. The process is:\n    |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n    *   **First transition:** |3, l=0, m=0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩\n        *   Since l=0, for Δl=±1, we must have l'=1.\n        *   For decay, n' < 3.\n        *   The state must exist, so for l'=1, the lowest possible value of n' is 2.\n        *   If n'=1, l' cannot be 1.\n        *   Therefore, the intermediate state must have n'=2 and l'=1.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = m'. So, m' can be 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   The possible intermediate states are: |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** |2, l'=1, m'⟩ → |1, l=0, m=0⟩\n        *   Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   Δm = 0 - m'. This must be 0, ±1. Since m' can be 0, ±1, this condition is satisfied for all three possible intermediate states.\n\n    This confirms that the decay can proceed through any of the three intermediate states: |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n3.  **Calculate the probabilities (Branching Ratios).**\n    We need to find the probability of a specific path, for example, the one given in option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. The total probability of this cascade is the product of the branching ratio of the first step and the branching ratio of the second step.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** The intermediate state is |2,1,m'⟩ (a 2p state). The only state with lower energy it can decay to via an electric dipole transition is the |1,0,0⟩ state (1s state). (Decay to |2,0,0⟩ is forbidden because Δl=-1 is required, but l is already 0, and decay to other n=2 states is not possible). Thus, the branching ratio for the decay |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is 1 (or 100%).\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** We need the branching ratio for the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩. This is the rate of this specific transition divided by the sum of the rates of all possible transitions from |3,0,0⟩ to the n=2, l=1 level.\n        The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (3s state) is spherically symmetric. Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon.\n        *   A transition to m'=0 (Δm=0) corresponds to emitting a z-polarized photon.\n        *   A transition to m'=±1 (Δm=±1) corresponds to emitting a circularly polarized photon in the x-y plane.\n        Since the initial state has no preferred orientation in space, the probabilities of transitioning to each of the three magnetic sublevels (m' = -1, 0, +1) of the l'=1 state must be equal.\n\n        The total probability of decaying from |3,0,0⟩ to the |2,1, *⟩ level is 1 (considering only this decay channel). This total probability is distributed equally among the three possible final m' states.\n        P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)\n        Since the sum of these probabilities is 1, each must be 1/3.\n\n    *   **Total Probability for the Route in option A:**\n        P_total = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\n        P_total = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\n4.  **Evaluate the options.**\n    *   A) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability 1/3. This matches our calculation.\n    *   B) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability 2/3. Incorrect probability.\n    *   C) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability 1/4. Incorrect probability (should be 1/3).\n    *   D) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability 1/4. Incorrect probability (should be 1/3).\n\nTherefore, option A provides a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Problem\nThe question asks for a valid decay route and its corresponding probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the excited state `|3,0,0>` to the ground state `|1,0,0>` via a cascade of two electric dipole transitions. The states are represented in the `|n,l,m>` notation, where `n` is the principal quantum number, `l` is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and `m` is the magnetic quantum number.\n\n### 2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions\nFor an atom to transition between two states by emitting a photon (an electric dipole transition), specific selection rules must be met. For a transition from `|n, l, m>` to `|n', l', m'>`:\n*   **Δl = l' - l = ±1** (The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one unit).\n*   **Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1** (The magnetic quantum number can remain the same or change by one unit).\n*   For emission, the energy must decrease, so **n' < n**.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Two-Step Transition Pathway\nThe decay process happens in two steps, involving an intermediate state `|n_i, l_i, m_i>`:\n`|3,0,0>` → `|n_i, l_i, m_i>` → `|1,0,0>`\n\n**Step 1: `|3,0,0>` → `|n_i, l_i, m_i>`**\nLet's apply the selection rules to the initial state `(n=3, l=0, m=0)`.\n*   The options suggest the intermediate state has `n_i = 2`. Since `2 < 3`, this is a valid decay.\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The initial state has `l=0`. Thus, `l_i - 0 = ±1`. As `l` must be non-negative, the only possibility is `l_i = 1`.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The initial state has `m=0`. Thus, `m_i - 0 = m_i`, so the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number `m_i` are -1, 0, and +1.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,-1>`, `|2,1,0>`, and `|2,1,1>`. All routes proposed in the options A, B, and D use one of these valid intermediate states.\n\n**Step 2: `|n_i, l_i, m_i>` → `|1,0,0>`**\nNow we verify if the second transition is allowed from the intermediate states `|2,1,m_i>` to the final ground state `|1,0,0>`.\n*   **Δl**: `l' - l_i = 0 - 1 = -1`. This satisfies the Δl = ±1 rule.\n*   **Δm**: `m' - m_i = 0 - m_i`. This must be 0, ±1. Since `m_i` can be -1, 0, or 1, the change `Δm` can be +1, 0, or -1, respectively. All are allowed.\n\nTherefore, all three cascade pathways are allowed by the selection rules.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question is to find the probability of a specific route. This \"probability\" is the branching ratio, which is determined by the relative strengths of the different possible transitions.\n\nThe transition rate for the first step, from `|3,0,0>` to `|2,1,m_i>`, depends on the square of the transition dipole moment. Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial `l=0` state, there is no preferred direction of emission. This means the atom has an equal chance of transitioning to any of the three `m_i` sublevels of the `l_i=1` state.\n\nThus, the total probability of 1 is split equally among the three possible decay channels:\n*   `P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3`\n*   `P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3`\n*   `P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3`\n\nOnce the atom is in a specific intermediate state (e.g., `|2,1,0>`), it will decay to the ground state `|1,0,0>` with certainty (as it is the only allowed subsequent dipole transition to `n=1`). Therefore, the probability of the entire cascade is determined solely by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\nThe probability of the specific route `|3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>` is the probability of the first step, which is 1/3.\n\n### 5. Final Answer\nComparing our result with the options:\n*   A) `|3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>` and `1/4`. (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) `|3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>` and `1/3`. **(Correct route and probability)**\n*   C) `... → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>` and `2/3`. (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) `|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>` and `1/4`. (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a two-step radiative decay process for a hydrogen atom, from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. The decay proceeds via an intermediate state through two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n2.  **Recall the Selection Rules for E1 Transitions:**\n    For an electric dipole transition between an initial state |n,l,m⟩ and a final state |n',l',m'⟩, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   Change in the principal quantum number, Δn = n' - n, can be any integer. For decay, n' < n.\n    *   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl = l' - l, must be ±1.\n    *   Change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = m' - m, must be 0 or ±1.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → Intermediate State |n',l',m'⟩**\n    *   Initial state: |3,0,0⟩, so n=3, l=0, m=0.\n    *   Applying the Δl rule: Δl = ±1 means l' = l ± 1 = 0 ± 1. Since l' must be non-negative, the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n    *   Applying the Δm rule: Δm = 0, ±1 means m' = m + Δm = 0 + Δm. So the intermediate state can have **m' = 0, +1, or -1**.\n    *   For decay, n' < n, so n' can be 2 or 1. However, if n'=1, then l' must be 0 (since l < n). But we found l'=1, so the intermediate state cannot have n'=1. Thus, the intermediate state must have **n' = 2**.\n    *   Combining these findings, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩. These correspond to the three sublevels of the 2p orbital.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Transition: Intermediate State |2,1,m'⟩ → Final State |1,0,0⟩**\n    *   Initial state (for this step): |2,1,m'⟩ where m' can be 1, 0, or -1. So n=2, l=1.\n    *   Final state: |1,0,0⟩, so n'=1, l'=0, m'=0.\n    *   Let's check the selection rules for each possible intermediate state:\n        *   From |2,1,m'⟩: Δl = l' - l = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   For the transition to be to |1,0,0⟩, the change in m must be Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m'.\n            *   If m' = 1, Δm = -1 (allowed).\n            *   If m' = 0, Δm = 0 (allowed).\n            *   If m' = -1, Δm = +1 (allowed).\n    *   Therefore, a dipole transition from any of the three |2,1,m'⟩ states to the |1,0,0⟩ state is allowed.\n    *   All options provided in the question identify one of these valid routes, specifically through one of the |2,1,m'⟩ states.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of the Specified Route**\n    The problem asks for the probability of a specific route, which is the product of the branching ratios for each step.\n    *   **Probability of Step 1: Branching Ratio for |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩**\n        The total decay rate from the |3,0,0⟩ state is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. As determined in step 3, the only possible decay channels are to the three states |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n        The rate of spontaneous emission between two states |i⟩ and |f⟩ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, `|<f|r|i>|^2`.\n        The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (an s-state) is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the three degenerate sublevels m' = -1, 0, +1 are equally probable.\n        Rate(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = Rate(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = Rate(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩).\n        Let this rate be `A`. The total decay rate from |3,0,0⟩ is `A_total = A + A + A = 3A`.\n        The branching ratio (probability) for the transition into any single specific `m'` state is:\n        `BR = A / A_total = A / (3A) = 1/3`.\n        So, the probability of the first step being |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ is **1/3**.\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 2: Branching Ratio for |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n        The atom is now in the intermediate state, e.g., |2,1,0⟩. We need to find its decay channels. The only lower energy level it can decay to via a dipole transition is the n=1 level. For n=1, l must be 0. So, the only possible final state is |1,0,0⟩.\n        Since this is the only allowed decay channel from any |2,1,m'⟩ state, the branching ratio for this transition is 1 (or 100%).\n        So, the probability of the second step, e.g., |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, is **1**.\n\n    *   **Total Probability of the Cascade Route**\n        The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route specified in options C and D:\n        `P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = P_step1 * P_step2`\n        `P = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3`.\n        The same logic applies to the routes via m'=-1 and m'=1, they each have a total probability of 1/3.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options**\n    Let's check the options against our calculated probability.\n    A) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩, Probability 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n    B) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩, Probability 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n    C) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩, Probability 2/3. (Incorrect probability)\n    D) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩, Probability 1/3. (Correct route and probability)\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe question asks for the transition route and the corresponding probability for the decay from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions.\nThe decay must proceed in two steps:\n1. |3,0,0⟩ $\\rightarrow$ |n',l',m'⟩\n2. |n',l',m'⟩ $\\rightarrow$ |1,0,0⟩\n\nFor the first step, the selection rules ($\\Delta l=\\pm1, \\Delta m=0, \\pm1$) dictate that the intermediate state must have $l'=1$. Since $l'<n'$, the principal quantum number $n'$ can be 2. So the intermediate states are the degenerate |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩ states.\nSince the initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$), the transition probabilities to the three degenerate $m'$ states of the $l'=1$ level are equal. Therefore, the branching ratio for the transition to any one of these states is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nFor the second step, consider the decay from any of the intermediate states, e.g., |2,1,0⟩. The selection rules allow a transition to the |1,0,0⟩ state ($\\Delta l=-1, \\Delta m=0$). This is the only allowed dipole decay channel to a lower energy state. Thus, the branching ratio for this second step is 1.\n\nThe total probability for the specific route |3,0,0⟩$\\rightarrow$|2,1,0⟩$\\rightarrow$|1,0,0⟩ is the product of the branching ratios of the two steps:\n$P = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes a decay from the hydrogen atom state |n=3, l=0, m=0> to the ground state |n=1, l=0, m=0>. This transition cannot happen via a single electric dipole (E1) transition because the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl, would be 0, which violates the E1 selection rule Δl = ±1.\n    The problem states the decay occurs via **two dipole transitions**. This means it's a cascade decay through an intermediate state. Let the intermediate state be |n', l', m'>.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State**\n    We need to apply the dipole selection rules for each step of the cascade.\n\n    *   **First Transition:** |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'>\n        *   Δl = l' - l = l' - 0 = ±1. Since l' must be non-negative, we must have **l' = 1**.\n        *   Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, ±1. So, the possible values for m' are **m' = -1, 0, 1**.\n        *   Δn can be anything. For a decay process, the energy decreases, so n' < n. The most probable intermediate state will be the one with the largest energy gap, which is typically the lowest possible principal quantum number, n'. The problem options suggest the intermediate state has n'=2, which is energetically allowed (E₃ > E₂) and follows the cascade decay pattern.\n\n    So, the possible intermediate states are |2, 1, -1>, |2, 1, 0>, and |2, 1, 1>.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** |2, 1, m'> → |1, 0, 0>\n        *   Δl = l_final - l_intermediate = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed by the selection rule (Δl = ±1).\n        *   Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m'. This must be 0 or ±1.\n            *   If m' = -1, Δm = 1 (Allowed).\n            *   If m' = 0, Δm = 0 (Allowed).\n            *   If m' = 1, Δm = -1 (Allowed).\n        *   Δn = 1 - 2 = -1 (Allowed).\n\n    Thus, all three states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> are valid intermediate states that can decay to the final state |1,0,0>. This means there are three possible decay routes.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Each Route**\n    The problem asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This refers to the branching ratio for that specific channel.\n\n    *   **Step 1 Probability:** The initial state is |3,0,0>, which is an s-state. Its wavefunction is spherically symmetric (independent of angles θ and φ). Because of this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the first photon. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate sub-levels |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1>.\n        The total transition rate from |3,0,0> to the |2,1> manifold is Γ_total. This total rate is the sum of the rates to the individual m' states:\n        Γ_total = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) + Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) + Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>)\n        Due to the symmetry, the rates are equal:\n        Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>)\n        Therefore, the probability (or branching ratio) for the first step to proceed via any specific m' state is 1/3.\n        P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3.\n        P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3.\n        P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3.\n\n    *   **Step 2 Probability:** Once the atom is in a specific intermediate state, say |2,1,0>, it will decay to |1,0,0>. As this is the only available E1 decay channel to the ground state, the probability of this second step, given that the first step has occurred, is 1 (or 100%).\n\n    *   **Overall Probability:** The probability of a specific cascade route is the probability of the first step. For the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, the probability is the probability of the first transition, which is 1/3. The same holds for the other two routes.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options**\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and Probability: 1/4. The route is possible, but the probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n    B) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and Probability: 1/3. The route is possible, and the probability is correct.\n    C) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and Probability: 2/3. The route is possible, but the probability is incorrect.\n    D) Route: |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and Probability: 1/4. The route is possible, but the probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\nThe only option that provides a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability is B.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The question asks for the decay route and probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the |3,0,0> (3s) state to the |1,0,0> (1s) state via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state, and two photons are emitted sequentially. This process is a cascade decay.\n\n2.  **Recall the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:** For a transition from a state |n,l,m> to |n',l',m'>, the selection rules are:\n    *   Δl = l' - l = ±1\n    *   Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1\n\n3.  **Determine the intermediate state:**\n    *   **First transition:** The atom starts in |3,0,0> (l=0, m=0).\n        *   Applying the Δl rule: Δl = l' - 0 = ±1. Since l must be non-negative, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: Δm = m' - 0 = 0, ±1. So the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   So the intermediate state is of the form |n', 1, m'> where m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}.\n    *   **Second transition:** The atom must end up in the |1,0,0> state. The transition is from |n', 1, m'> to |1,0,0>.\n        *   Applying the Δl rule: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: Δm = 0 - m'. This must be 0, ±1. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate m' values (-1, 0, 1).\n    *   **The principal quantum number n' of the intermediate state:** The problem describes a two-photon decay. The rate of such a process is calculated using second-order perturbation theory, and the amplitude involves a sum over all possible intermediate states |n',l',m'>. The amplitude is proportional to 1/(E_initial - E_intermediate). To maximize the transition rate, the energy difference in the denominator should be minimized. The energy of a state is given by E_n = -R_H/n^2.\n        *   E_initial = E_3s = -R_H/9.\n        *   The possible intermediate states are |n'p> states (l=1).\n        *   For n'=2, E_intermediate = E_2p = -R_H/4. Denominator term: |E_3s - E_2p| = |-R_H/9 + R_H/4| = 5R_H/36.\n        *   For n'=4, E_intermediate = E_4p = -R_H/16. Denominator term: |E_3s - E_4p| = |-R_H/9 + R_H/16| = 7R_H/144.\n        The denominator is smallest for n'=2. Therefore, the cascade overwhelmingly proceeds through the |2,1,m'> intermediate states. The problem options all use |2,1,m'>, confirming this.\n\n4.  **Determine the possible decay routes:** Based on the above, there are three possible cascade routes, all passing through the n=2, l=1 (2p) shell:\n    *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability of each route:**\n    *   The probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, because the second step (2p -> 1s) is the only allowed decay channel for the 2p state, so its probability is 1.\n    *   The probability (branching ratio) of the first transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$ is given by:\n        $P(m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m''=-1,0,1} \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m''\\rangle)}$\n        where Γ is the transition rate.\n    *   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. For a spontaneous decay from a spherically symmetric state in the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transition rates to each of the magnetic sublevels m' = -1, 0, +1 of the p-state (l=1) must be equal.\n    *   This can be formally shown by calculating the matrix elements, which confirms that $|\\langle 2,1,0 | z | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,1 | (x+iy)/\\sqrt{2} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,-1 | (x-iy)/\\sqrt{2} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$. In fact, the total rate to $|2,1,1\\rangle$, summing over polarizations, is proportional to $|\\langle 2,1,1|x|3,0,0\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,1|y|3,0,0\\rangle|^2$, which can be shown to be equal to $|\\langle 2,1,0|z|3,0,0\\rangle|^2$.\n    *   So, $\\Gamma(m'=-1) = \\Gamma(m'=0) = \\Gamma(m'=1)$.\n    *   The total transition rate is $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma(m'=-1) + \\Gamma(m'=0) + \\Gamma(m'=1) = 3\\Gamma(m'=0)$.\n    *   The probability for the decay to proceed through any specific sublevel m' is:\n        $P(m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(m')}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma(m')}{3\\Gamma(m')} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   Each of the three possible routes has a probability of 1/3.\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid physical statement is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\n\nThe problem describes a two-step radiative decay of a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Initial State:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. In spectroscopic notation, this is the 3s state.\n*   **Final State:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. In spectroscopic notation, this is the 1s state.\n*   **Mechanism:** The decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|m\\rangle$.\n*   **The overall process is:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{photon 1}} |m\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{photon 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Applying Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nFor a transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ to be allowed by the E1 selection rules, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n*   **Δl = l' - l = ±1**\n*   **Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1**\n*   **Δn = n' - n** can be any integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), energy must be released, so the energy of the final state must be lower, which generally means n' < n.\n\n### 3. Identifying the Intermediate State $|m\\rangle = |n_m, l_m, m_m\\rangle$\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions in the cascade.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_m, l_m, m_m\\rangle$**\n*   **l-selection rule:** $l_m - l_{initial} = l_m - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l_m = 1$. This means the intermediate state is a p-state.\n*   **m-selection rule:** $m_m - m_{initial} = m_m - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m_m$ are $0, +1, -1$.\n*   **n-selection rule:** For decay, $n_m < n_{initial} = 3$. The possible values for $n_m$ are 1 or 2.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n_m, l_m, m_m\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **l-selection rule:** $l_{final} - l_m = 0 - l_m = \\pm 1$. This confirms our finding from the first step that $l_m = 1$.\n*   **m-selection rule:** $m_{final} - m_m = 0 - m_m = 0, \\pm 1$. This means $m_m$ can be $0, +1, -1$. This is consistent with what we found for the first transition.\n*   **n-selection rule:** For decay, $n_{final} < n_m$. Since $n_{final} = 1$, we must have $n_m > 1$.\n\n**Combining the conditions:**\nFrom the first transition, we need $l_m=1$ and $n_m < 3$. From the second transition, we need $l_m=1$ and $n_m > 1$. The only integer value for $n_m$ that satisfies both is $n_m=2$.\n\nTherefore, the intermediate state $|m\\rangle$ must be a $|2,1,m_m\\rangle$ state, where $m_m \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. These correspond to the $2p_z$ ($m_m=0$), $2p_x$, and $2p_y$ orbitals.\n\n### 4. Identifying Possible Transition Routes\n\nBased on the possible values for the intermediate state, there are three distinct decay routes:\n*   **Route 1:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Route 2:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Route 3:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll four options provided in the question correspond to these valid routes. We now need to determine the probability of each route.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe probability of a particular decay route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. This is because once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m_m\\rangle$ states, it has only one allowed dipole decay channel: to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Thus, the second transition in the cascade happens with a probability of 1.\n\nThe probability of the first transition, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_m\\rangle$, depends on the transition rate, $\\Gamma$, which is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n$\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m_m | \\hat{\\mathbf{d}} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (3s orbital) is spherically symmetric (its angular wavefunction $Y_{0,0}$ is a constant). When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the degenerate destination sublevels.\n\nThe destination sublevels are the three degenerate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. Since they are energetically degenerate (in the absence of external fields) and the initial state has no directional preference, the transition probability is distributed equally among them.\n\n*   Total probability of decaying from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $|2,1\\rangle$ level is 1 (as it's the only path).\n*   There are 3 possible final m-states for this transition.\n*   Probability for each m-state = (Total Probability) / (Number of states) = $1/3$.\n\nSo, the probabilities for the first step are:\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\nSince the probability of the second step in each cascade is 1, the total probability for each route is determined solely by the probability of the first step.\n*   **Prob(Route 1):** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   **Prob(Route 2):** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   **Prob(Route 3):** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### 6. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's check the given options against our findings:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   This matches our calculated route and probability for Route 1.\n*   B) Same route as A, but probability $\\frac{2}{3}$. Incorrect probability.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, option A provides a correct transition route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Process and Selection Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a two-step radiative decay from the excited state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ of a hydrogen atom to its ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via an intermediate state through two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n*   **Parity Change:** The parity of the state, given by $(-1)^l$, must change. This is ensured by the `l` selection rule.\n*   **Angular Momentum Quantum Number `l`:** $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Magnetic Quantum Number `m`:** $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   There is no strict rule for the principal quantum number `n`, but for a decay (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n**2. First Transition: from |3,0,0> to an Intermediate State**\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$, where $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Intermediate State:** Let's call it $|n'', l'', m''\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the selection rules for `l`:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l'' - l = l'' - 0 = \\pm 1$.\n    *   Since $l''$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l'' = 1$.\n*   Applying the selection rules for `m`:\n    *   $\\Delta m = m'' - m = m'' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are $m'' = -1, 0, 1$.\n*   For the principal quantum number `n`, the process is a two-step cascade from $n=3$ to $n=1$. This implies the intermediate state must have $n''=2$.\n\nCombining these, the possible intermediate states are:\n*   $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$\n*   $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$\n*   $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$\n\n**3. Second Transition: from Intermediate State to |1,0,0>**\n\nNow, let's check if the transitions from these possible intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ are allowed.\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$, where $n=1, l=0, m=0$.\n*   For any of the intermediate states $|2, 1, m''\\rangle$:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l'' = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m'' = 0 - m'' = -m''$. Since $m'' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, the possible values for $\\Delta m$ are $+1, 0, -1$, all of which are allowed.\n\nSo, all three transition routes are physically possible:\n*   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4. Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n\nThe probability of a specific route occurring is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. This is because once the atom is in one of the intermediate $|2,1,m''\\rangle$ states, it has only one allowed dipole decay channel to reach the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nThe transition rate $\\Gamma$ for spontaneous emission from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the electric dipole operator $\\mathbf{r}$:\n$\\Gamma_{i \\to f} \\propto |\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe operator $\\mathbf{r}$ can be decomposed into spherical tensor components $r_q$ (where $q=\\Delta m$):\n*   $r_{+1} \\propto (x+iy)$ corresponds to $\\Delta m = +1$.\n*   $r_0 \\propto z$ corresponds to $\\Delta m = 0$.\n*   $r_{-1} \\propto (x-iy)$ corresponds to $\\Delta m = -1$.\n\nThe matrix element can be separated into a radial part and an angular part. The angular part is described by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n$\\Gamma(|n,l,m\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle) \\propto |R_{n'l' \\leftarrow nl}|^2 \\times |\\langle l,m; 1,q | l',m' \\rangle|^2$, where $q = m' - m$.\n\nLet's calculate the relative rates for the first transition, from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the three possible intermediate states:\n*   The radial integral $R_{2,1 \\leftarrow 3,0}$ is the same for all three transitions because it only depends on the quantum numbers $(n,l)$ and $(n',l')$, not on $m$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the angular part for each path:\n1.  **To $|2,1,-1\\rangle$:** $m'' = -1$. We need $q = \\Delta m = -1 - 0 = -1$.\n    Rate $\\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,-1 | 1,-1 \\rangle|^2$.\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding an angular momentum of 0 to any other angular momentum is always 1 (i.e., $\\langle l_1, m_1; 0, 0 | l_1, m_1 \\rangle = 1$).\n    So, the angular part squared is $1^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **To $|2,1,0\\rangle$:** $m'' = 0$. We need $q = \\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$.\n    Rate $\\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,0 | 1,0 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n\n3.  **To $|2,1,1\\rangle$:** $m'' = 1$. We need $q = \\Delta m = 1 - 0 = 1$.\n    Rate $\\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,1 | 1,1 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n\nSince both the radial and angular parts are identical for the three possible transitions, the transition rates are equal. Let's call the rate $\\Gamma_0$.\n*   $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\Gamma_0$\n*   $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma_0$\n*   $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\Gamma_0$\n\nThe total transition rate out of $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (to the $2p$ shell) is $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n\nThe probability (or branching ratio) for each path is the rate for that path divided by the total rate:\nProbability(path) = $\\frac{\\Gamma_0}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, each of the three possible routes has a probability of $1/3$.\n\n**5. Match with Options**\nLet's check the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ - Correct path and correct probability.\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ - Incorrect probability.\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process and States:**\n    The problem asks for a specific decay route and its probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ (also known as the 3s state) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state). The process is specified as happening via \"two dipole transitions\". This means it's a two-step process, also known as a cascade decay.\n    *   Initial State ($|i\\rangle$): $|3,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Final State ($|f\\rangle$): $|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Intermediate State ($|k\\rangle$): Let's denote this as $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:**\n    For an electric dipole transition to occur, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer value, but for decay (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State(s):**\n    *   **Step 1:** Transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n        *   $l=0 \\rightarrow l'$: According to $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   $n=3 \\rightarrow n'$: Since energy must decrease, $n'<3$. The most probable decay is to the next available energy level, so we consider $n'=2$. Thus, the intermediate state is a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (a 2p state).\n        *   $m=0 \\rightarrow m'$: According to $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate magnetic quantum number can be $m' = 0, +1, -1$.\n    *   So, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Step 2:** Transition from $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   $l'=1 \\rightarrow l_f=0$: This gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is an allowed transition.\n        *   $m'=m' \\rightarrow m_f=0$: This gives $\\Delta m = -m'$. Since $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$, $\\Delta m$ can be $1, 0, -1$, which are all allowed.\n        *   $n'=2 \\rightarrow n_f=1$: Energy decreases, so this decay is allowed.\n\n    *   Therefore, there are three valid two-step transition routes:\n        1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of each Route:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n    *   Probability(Route via $m'$) = BR($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$) $\\times$ BR($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$).\n\n    *   **Second Step:** The only dipole-allowed decay from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. (Decay to $|2,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l=0$). Thus, the branching ratio for this step is 1 for all three routes.\n        BR($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) = 1.\n\n    *   **First Step:** We need the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states. The branching ratio is the ratio of the rate of a specific transition to the total transition rate.\n        BR($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$) = $\\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\Gamma_{total}(|3,0,0\\rangle)}$.\n\n    *   The total decay rate in this two-step dipole channel is the sum of the rates to the three intermediate states:\n        $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) + \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) + \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$.\n\n    *   The transition rate $\\Gamma(i \\rightarrow f)$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$. We need to compare the rates $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$ for $m'=-1, 0, 1$.\n\n    *   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). There is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom must decay with equal probability to each of the degenerate final states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. Any experiment measuring the population of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states after the decay from an ensemble of atoms initially in the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state would find them to be equally populated.\n\n    *   **Formal Calculation (using the Wigner-Eckart Theorem):** The transition rate is proportional to $|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\vec{d}_q | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d}_q$ are the spherical tensor components of the dipole operator and $q=\\Delta m = m'$. The Wigner-Eckart theorem states that this matrix element is the product of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and a reduced matrix element that is independent of the magnetic quantum numbers.\n        $\\langle 2,1,m' | d_{m'} | 3,0,0 \\rangle \\propto \\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$.\n        The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle j_1,0; j_2,m_2 | J,m_2 \\rangle$ with $j_1=0$ is always equal to 1.\n        Therefore, the matrix elements have the same magnitude for all three values of $m'$, and consequently, the transition rates are equal:\n        $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$.\n\n    *   Since the three rates are equal, the branching ratio to each of these states is $1/3$.\n        BR($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$) = $\\frac{\\Gamma_0}{\\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Final Probability and Conclusion:**\n    The overall probability for any of the three specific routes is:\n    Probability(Route via $m'$) = $(1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\n    Now, let's examine the given options:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct path and probability)\n    C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Garbled, but incorrect probability)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only option that matches our derivation is B. The probability of the cascade $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is indeed $1/3$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
