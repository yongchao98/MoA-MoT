To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.\n\nA) C6H10O\nB) C6H12O\nC) C6H10O2\nD) C6H12O2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic feature. A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is the classic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding (dimerization). While alcohols also have a broad O-H peak, it is typically centered higher (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹) and is usually less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the C=O group of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the molecule is also an alkene (i.e., it is unsaturated).\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n\n*   **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the conclusion from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial clue. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45.\n    *   Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   The fragment at m/z = 45 is a very common and diagnostically important fragment for carboxylic acids.\n\n**4. Synthesize All Evidence and Determine the Formula:**\n\n*   The evidence from all three techniques points towards the molecule being an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n*   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C (C₆H₁₀O) and D (C₆H₁₂O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n*   We are left with two possibilities: **C₆H₁₀O₂** and **C₆H₁₂O₂**.\n*   To decide between these two, we use the concept of the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   DoU Formula = C + 1 - (H/2)\n*   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain:\n    1.  One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid). This accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    2.  One C=C double bond (from the alkene group). This accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct formula must have a total DoU of at least 2.\n*   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **For C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This perfectly matches our required two degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   **For C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula only accounts for the C=O bond of a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid) and contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C double bond from both FTIR and NMR.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. It must contain two oxygen atoms and have at least two degrees of unsaturation. Only the formula C₆H₁₀O₂ fits all the experimental data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic absorption for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad unless the sample is very concentrated, and the combination with other peaks points away from a simple alcohol.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, carboxylic acids show a C=O stretch around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a double bond. The presence of these peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, which corroborates the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. We can calculate its mass: Carbon (12) + Oxygen (16) + Oxygen (16) + Hydrogen (1) = 45. This corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ fragment ion. The presence of this fragment is very strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   From FTIR and Mass Spec, we have confirmed a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH). This group contains two oxygen atoms and one C=O double bond.\n    *   From FTIR and 1H NMR, we have confirmed a **C=C double bond** (alkene).\n\n5.  **Determine the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   A molecule's structure must account for all the identified features. The presence of one C=O double bond contributes one degree of unsaturation. The presence of one C=C double bond contributes another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for the molecule is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formula Options:**\n    *   The general formula for calculating the Degree of Unsaturation is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect this calculation.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for each option and see if it has two oxygens (for the carboxylic acid) and a DoU of 2.\n\n    *   **A) C6H10O:**\n        *   Oxygens: 1. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. The DoU is correct, but the number of oxygens is not.\n\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:**\n        *   Oxygens: 2. This is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This is inconsistent. A DoU of 1 would mean only one double bond (the C=O of the acid) and no C=C bond, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n    *   **C) C6H12O:**\n        *   Oxygens: 1. Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. Inconsistent.\n\n    *   **D) C6H10O2:**\n        *   Oxygens: 2. **Consistent** with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. **Consistent** with the presence of both a C=O and a C=C double bond.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only formula that fits all the evidence is C6H10O2. It has the correct number of oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carboxylic acid's C=O bond and the alkene's C=C bond. An example of such a compound would be hexenoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The \"very broad\" nature of this peak is highly characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH), where hydrogen bonding causes significant peak broadening.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically found around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n*Conclusion from FTIR:* The combination of a very broad O-H peak, a C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, and a C=C peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ strongly suggests the compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl-hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n*Conclusion from ¹H NMR:* The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass of C = ~12 amu\n    *   Mass of O = ~16 amu\n    *   Mass of H = ~1 amu\n    *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   This fragmentation provides strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n*Conclusion from Mass Spec:* The compound contains a -COOH group.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   From the analysis, we have established that the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecular formula must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O).\n*   We are left with two options: A) C₆H₁₀O₂ and C) C₆H₁₂O₂.\n*   The presence of a C=C double bond (an alkene) means the molecule is unsaturated. We can confirm which formula is correct by calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The formula for DoU is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n*   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **For C₆H₁₀O₂ (Option A):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. A DoU of 2 is consistent with one C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C bond (from the alkene). This fits all our spectral evidence.\n    *   **For C₆H₁₂O₂ (Option C):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. This would mean the carbon chain is saturated (no C=C bond or rings), which contradicts the FTIR and ¹H NMR data showing an alkene is present.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only molecular formula that accounts for all the spectral evidence—a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond—is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAll the analytical data point to the same conclusion. Let's summarize the evidence:\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ combined with the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is definitive evidence for a **carboxylic acid** functional group (-COOH).\n    *   The strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (**alkene**, C=C).\n\n2.  **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of the **alkene** group suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The fragment peak at m/z = 45 corresponds to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong confirmation of the **carboxylic acid** group.\n\n**Putting it all together:**\n*   The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the formula must contain two oxygen atoms, eliminating options C (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n*   We must now decide between **A) C6H10O2** and **B) C6H12O2**.\n*   The molecule has one double bond from the carbonyl (C=O) in the carboxylic acid and a second double bond from the alkene (C=C). This means the molecule has a **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2**.\n\nThe code calculated the DoU for the remaining options:\n*   **C6H10O2:** DoU = 2\n*   **C6H12O2:** DoU = 1\n\nThe molecular formula C6H10O2 has a Degree of Unsaturation of 2, which perfectly matches the required two double bonds (one C=O and one C=C). The formula C6H12O2 has a DoU of 1, which could only account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond, not the additional C=C bond.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating that the molecule is an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The presence of these signals in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene group, which corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n    *   The observation of a fragment at m/z = 45 is strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group, which readily fragments to form the stable [COOH]⁺ cation.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Information and Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   From the combined data, we can conclude that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This allows us to immediately eliminate options A (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are now left with two possibilities: B (C₆H₁₀O₂) and C (C₆H₁₂O₂).\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), also known as the Double Bond Equivalent (DBE). The formula for a compound with C carbons and H hydrogens is: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1.\n    *   Our structural analysis showed the presence of one C=C double bond (1 degree of unsaturation) and one C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid group (1 degree of unsaturation). Therefore, the total DoU for the molecule must be 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   For **B) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**.\n        *   For **C) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**.\n    *   The calculated DoU for C₆H₁₀O₂ is 2, which perfectly matches the structural features identified from the spectra (one C=C and one C=O). The DoU for C₆H₁₂O₂ is 1, which would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid), contradicting the evidence for a C=C double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The combination of this C=O peak and the broad O-H peak is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens (hydrogens attached to the carbons of a double bond) confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic and very common fragment for carboxylic acids. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ cation (Carbon = 12, Oxygen = 16, Hydrogen = 1; Total mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n4.  **Integration of the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   The combined data from all three techniques strongly indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains a C=C double bond.\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains two oxygen atoms.

The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n    *   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain at least one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond. This means the molecule must have a Degree of Unsaturation of at least 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This value is consistent with the presence of one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n        *   **For C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This value is not consistent with the presence of both a C=O and a C=C bond. A molecule with this formula could be a carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it could not also contain a C=C double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only chemical formula that accounts for all the experimental evidence (a carboxylic acid group and a C=C double bond) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe reasoning and thinking process has already been generated in the previous turn. The provided code output confirms the manual reasoning.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   Broad peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹ indicates an O-H stretch from a hydrogen-bonded group, highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   Peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ indicates a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates a C=C (alkene) stretch.\n    *   *Conclusion:* The molecule is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The presence of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the existence of a C=C double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment at m/z = 45 is a classic signature for the [COOH]⁺ fragment, further confirming the carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Molecular Formula Requirements:**\n    *   **Oxygens:** A carboxylic acid group has two oxygen atoms, so the formula must be O₂.

This accounts for both the C=O and the C=C double bonds. This is correct.\n\nThe code output confirms this analysis, showing that only option D has both 2 oxygen atoms and a Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1.

The broadness is key; while alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch.

The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds).\n        *   One C=O double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n        *   One C=C double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n        *   Therefore, the molecule must have a DoU of at least 2.\n\n    *   Let's check the proposed molecular formulas:\n        *   **A) C6H10O2:**\n            *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n            *   Contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n            *   This formula has the correct DoU (2) and the correct number of oxygens (2) for an unsaturated carboxylic acid. **This is a perfect match.**\n        *   **B) C6H12O2:**\n            *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n            *   This DoU is too low. It could represent a saturated carboxylic acid, but it cannot have the C=C double bond required by the FTIR and NMR data.\n        *   **C) C6H10O:**\n            *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n            *   The DoU is correct, but it only has one oxygen atom. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid, which requires two oxygens.\n        *   **D) C6H12O:**\n            *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n            *   The DoU is incorrect, and it only has one oxygen atom.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nOnly the molecular formula C6H10O2 is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data, which points unequivocally to an unsaturated carboxylic acid with six carbons.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**Reasoning Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of an O-H bond stretch within a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) bond stretch. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at ~1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the region for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The unknown compound contains both a carboxylic acid functional group and an alkene functional group.

This observation confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and indicative fragment. Let's calculate its composition:\n        *   Carbon (C) = 12 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O) = 16 amu\n        *   Hydrogen (H) = 1 amu\n        *   The fragment [COOH]⁺ has a mass of 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   **Mass Spec Conclusion:** The presence of a fragment at m/z = 45 is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   Based on the FTIR and Mass Spec data, the compound must be a carboxylic acid. This means its molecular formula must contain **two oxygen atoms (O2)**. This immediately eliminates options C (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O).\n    *   We are now left with A) C6H12O2 and B) C6H10O2.\n    *   The data also shows the presence of a C=C double bond (alkene). We can use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine which formula is correct. The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   Our molecule has one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, it must have a **DoU of 2**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n        *   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula can only account for one double bond (the C=O), but not the additional C=C.\n        *   **B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula correctly accounts for two degrees of unsaturation, fitting both the C=O bond and the C=C bond.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The only molecular formula that satisfies all the spectroscopic evidence (carboxylic acid group, alkene group, and the corresponding degree of unsaturation) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also show an O-H stretch, it's typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group within a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The additional C=C peak indicates the molecule is unsaturated.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum unequivocally confirms the existence of an alkene group in the molecule, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the most likely candidate, the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺).\n    *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + (2 * 16) + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This is a perfect match and a very common and diagnostically significant fragment for carboxylic acids. This provides strong confirmation for the presence of a -COOH group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we have definitively identified two functional groups in the unknown compound: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options C) C6H10O and D) C6H12O, which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with A) C6H10O2 and B) C6H12O2.\n    *   To differentiate between these two, we can use the concept of the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   Our identified functional groups require at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=C double bond and one for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid. So, we expect DoU = 2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our requirement for one C=C bond and one C=O bond.\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This DoU of 1 would correspond to a molecule with only one double bond (the C=O of the carboxylic acid), meaning it would be a saturated carboxylic acid. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data, which prove the existence of a C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence (presence of a carboxylic acid, presence of an alkene, and the corresponding degree of unsaturation) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. While alcohols also have a broad O-H stretch, it's typically centered higher (around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹) and is less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The position is consistent with the carbonyl stretch in a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch, a C=O stretch, and a C=C stretch strongly suggests that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the conclusion drawn from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to identify a common fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. The mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as:\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This m/z = 45 peak is a characteristic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ ion. This provides very strong confirmation that the molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Combine the Evidence and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the analysis, we know the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options **C) C6H10O** and **D) C6H12O**, as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with **A) C6H10O2** and **B) C6H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 (for compounds with C, H, and O).\n    *   Our spectroscopic data tells us we have:\n        *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid). This contributes 1 to the DoU.\n        *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene). This contributes another 1 to the DoU.\n    *   Therefore, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for our molecule is 1 + 1 = **2**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n    *   **For B) C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which only has the C=O double bond. It does not account for the C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to a molecule with a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond. This requires two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of 2. Only the formula **C6H10O2** satisfies all these conditions.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between acid molecules. An alcohol O-H is also in this region but is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically observed around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n    *Conclusion from FTIR:* The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).

Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group, -COOH.\n        *   Mass = (1 x Carbon) + (2 x Oxygen) + (1 x Hydrogen)\n        *   Mass ≈ (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   The [COOH]⁺ fragment is a very common and stable fragment observed in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids. This piece of data provides strong confirmation for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we have concluded that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B) C6H12O and C) C6H10O, which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with A) C6H10O2 and D) C6H12O2. To distinguish between these, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n    *   Our molecule has one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means it must have a total of **2 degrees of unsaturation**.\n\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For D) C6H12O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n            This formula corresponds to a molecule with only one degree of unsaturation. This would represent a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), where the only pi bond is the C=O. This contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond.\n        *   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n            This formula corresponds to a molecule with two degrees of unsaturation. This perfectly accommodates one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond, consistent with all the spectral evidence. An example structure would be hexenoic acid.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The evidence from all three characterization techniques points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid.

Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺):\n        *   Carbon (C): ~12 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O): ~16 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O): ~16 amu\n        *   Hydrogen (H): ~1 amu\n        *   Total Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   **Mass Spec Conclusion:** This fragment strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we know the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains an alkene (a C=C double bond).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) by definition contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H10O) and C (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: A) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2.\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation** (DoU), also known as the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n        DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (for formulas containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   Our identified functional groups tell us what the DoU should be:\n        *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) contributes 1 to the DoU.\n        *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) contributes another 1 to the DoU.\n        *   Therefore, the total DoU of the molecule must be 1 + 1 = **2**.\n    *   Now let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O in the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the additional C=C double bond. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n        *   **For D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our required value, accounting for both the carboxylic acid's C=O bond and the alkene's C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule with a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group. This structure requires two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation. Only the chemical formula C6H10O2 satisfies these requirements.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nBased on the spectroscopic data, we can deduce the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ (typically spanning 2500-3300 cm⁻¹) is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid**. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of the C=O stretch, also consistent with a **carboxylic acid** (~1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=C double bond, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The presence of peaks for vinyl-hydrogens confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. The [COOH]⁺ fragment has a mass of 12 (C) + 16 (O) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45.\n\n**Synthesis and Calculation:**\n\nFrom the data, we have established that the molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n*   The carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H10O) and C (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n*   The choice is now between A (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2).\n*   We need to check the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for each formula to see which one can accommodate both a C=O double bond (one degree of unsaturation) and a C=C double bond (a second degree of unsaturation). The total DoU must be at least 2.\n\nThe formula for the degree of unsaturation is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (ignoring N and halogens).\n\n*   **For C6H12O2 (Option A):**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    This formula has only one degree of unsaturation. It can account for the C=O in the carboxylic acid, but not the additional C=C from the alkene.\n\n*   **For C6H10O2 (Option D):**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accounts for one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond.\n\nTherefore, the only molecular formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules. While alcohols also show an O-H stretch, it is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with a very broad O-H stretch, it strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene, which is consistent with the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a plausible chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the suspected carboxylic acid group:\n    *   Fragment: [COOH]⁺\n    *   Mass = (1 × Mass of Carbon) + (2 × Mass of Oxygen) + (1 × Mass of Hydrogen)\n    *   Mass = (1 × 12.01) + (2 × 16.00) + (1 × 1.01) ≈ 45\n    *   This m/z = 45 fragment is a very common and diagnostic cleavage pattern for carboxylic acids, resulting from the loss of the alkyl chain. This strongly confirms the presence of the -COOH functional group.\n\n**4. Synthesis and Calculation of Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n\nThe spectroscopic data reveals that the unknown molecule must contain:\n1.  A C=C double bond (from FTIR and NMR). This accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n2.  A C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid group (from FTIR and MS). This accounts for a **second degree of unsaturation**.\n\nTherefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total of **2 degrees of unsaturation**. It must also contain at least two oxygen atoms to form the carboxylic acid group.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for each of the given options using the formula: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This formula has two oxygen atoms and the required 2 degrees of unsaturation. This is a perfect match.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This formula only has one oxygen and an incorrect DoU.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This formula has an incorrect DoU; it would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. While the DoU is correct, this formula only has one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with the clear evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the provided data (presence of a carboxylic acid, an alkene, and a total of 2 degrees of unsaturation) is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\n**Final Answer Rationale:**\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:** The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ combined with the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The presence of two oxygen atoms is implied. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), meaning the molecule is unsaturated.\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:** The observation of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of the C=C double bond suggested by the FTIR data.\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:** A fragment at m/z = 45 is the mass of the carboxyl cation ([COOH]⁺), providing strong confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n4.  **Formula Determination:**\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must have two oxygen atoms. This narrows the choices down to **A) C₆H₁₀O₂** and **C) C₆H₁₂O₂**.\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) must account for both the C=O bond in the acid and the C=C bond of the alkene. This means the molecule has a DoU of 2.\n    *   Calculating the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This matches the spectroscopic evidence.\n        *   **C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid, which contradicts the evidence of a C=C bond.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the data is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is a hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. For a carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly suggests the presence of both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group in the molecule.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum provides direct confirmation of the alkene functional group that was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH):\n    *   Mass = (1 x mass of C) + (2 x mass of O) + (1 x mass of H)\n    *   Mass = (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n*   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 corresponding to [COOH]⁺ is a very common and diagnostically significant fragment for carboxylic acids.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options**\n\n*   From the combined spectroscopic evidence, we can definitively say that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a C=C double bond.\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid group means the molecule must have **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O).\n*   We are left with two options: C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. To distinguish between them, we calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C - (H/2) + 1` (for a formula containing only C, H, and O).\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **For C6H12O2 (Option C):**\n    *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**\n    *   A DoU of 1 means there is one double bond or one ring. The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group accounts for this single degree of unsaturation. This formula would correspond to a *saturated* carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C double bond.\n\n*   **For C6H10O2 (Option B):**\n    *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**\n    *   A DoU of 2 is required to account for two double bonds. Our spectroscopic analysis identified one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond. This formula perfectly matches all the evidence.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence from all three techniques points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the formula C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere's my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:** I'll analyze each piece of evidence provided.\n\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n        *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for an O-H stretch. The broadness is key; it strongly suggests the O-H is part of a carboxylic acid due to hydrogen bonding, which creates a very wide absorption band. An alcohol O-H stretch is also in this region but is typically less broad.\n        *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Paired with the broad O-H peak, a carboxylic acid (C=O stretch ~1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is the most likely candidate.\n        *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** This explicitly confirms the presence of hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This reinforces the conclusion from the 1650 cm⁻¹ FTIR peak.\n\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n        *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** I need to identify what common fragment has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the functional group we suspect: the carboxyl group (-COOH).\n            *   Carbon (C) ≈ 12 amu\n            *   Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 amu\n            *   Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1 amu\n            *   Mass of -COOH = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n        *   This m/z = 45 peak is a very strong confirmation for a carboxylic acid, as the cleavage of the bond next to the carbonyl group (alpha-cleavage) to lose the -COOH group is a common fragmentation pathway.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This accounts for the broad O-H, the C=O at 1700 cm⁻¹, and the m/z=45 fragment. It also means the molecule must contain at least two oxygen atoms.\n    *   The compound contains a carbon-carbon double bond (alkene). This accounts for the C=C peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ and the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR.\n\n    Therefore, the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formula Options using Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula for a compound with C, H, and O is:\n    DoU = C - (H/2) + 1\n\n    My analysis indicates the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C alkene. Let's calculate the DoU for each option.\n\n    *   **A) C6H10O2:**\n        *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2.\n        *   This fits our requirement for two degrees of unsaturation. It also has two oxygen atoms, which is required for a carboxylic acid. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **B) C6H10O:**\n        *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2.\n        *   While it has the correct DoU, it only has one oxygen. This would make it an unsaturated ketone or aldehyde, which is less consistent with the very broad O-H peak and the m/z=45 fragment characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **C) C6H12O2:**\n        *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1.\n        *   This has only one degree of unsaturation. It could be a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid), but it cannot have the C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n\n    *   **D) C6H12O:**\n        *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1.\n        *   This has only one degree of unsaturation and one oxygen. This could be a saturated ketone/aldehyde or an unsaturated alcohol, neither of which fits all the data.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The formula **C6H10O2** is the only one that satisfies all the experimental evidence:\n    *   It has two oxygens, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   It has two degrees of unsaturation, accommodating one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data:\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:** The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹, coupled with a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, is definitive evidence for a **carboxylic acid** functional group (-COOH). The additional peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (**alkene**, C=C).\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:** The observation of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the existence of the C=C double bond.\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:** The fragment at m/z = 45 is a characteristic fragment for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the `[COOH]+` ion.\n4.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:** The molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and an alkene group (C=C), meaning it must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation**. A carboxylic acid also requires **two oxygen atoms**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options against these requirements:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O:** Has only 1 oxygen atom. Incorrect.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:** Has 2 oxygen atoms but only 1 degree of unsaturation (DoU = 6 - 12/2 + 1 = 1). This would be a saturated carboxylic acid, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data showing a C=C bond. Incorrect.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O:** Has only 1 oxygen atom and 1 degree of unsaturation. Incorrect.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:** Has 2 oxygen atoms and 2 degrees of unsaturation (DoU = 6 - 10/2 + 1 = 2). This formula perfectly accounts for a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group (an alkenoic acid). **Correct.**\n\nThus, the only formula that fits all the evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). It can also indicate an alcohol (-OH), but the broadness is usually more pronounced for carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The combination of a very broad O-H peak and a C=O peak strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The presence of a C=C peak indicates the molecule is unsaturated.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to the carbons of a double bond (H-C=C). This piece of data explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which corroborates the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to determine the possible atomic composition of a fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. We will use the integer masses of the most common isotopes (C=12, H=1, O=16).\n    *   Let's test some combinations:\n        *   C₃H₉⁺: (3 * 12) + 9 = 36 + 9 = 45. This is the propyl cation.\n        *   C₂H₅O⁺: (2 * 12) + 5 + 16 = 24 + 5 + 16 = 45. This is an ethoxy or hydroxyethyl fragment.\n        *   COOH⁺: 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45. This corresponds to the carboxyl group fragment.\n    *   Given the strong evidence for a carboxylic acid from the FTIR data, the fragment at m/z = 45 is almost certainly the [COOH]⁺ fragment. This provides powerful confirmation of the carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize All Information:**\n    *   From FTIR and Mass Spec, we have identified a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**. This functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   From FTIR and 1H NMR, we have identified a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas using the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (or Double Bond Equivalent) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is `DBE = C - H/2 + 1` (for molecules containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   Our molecule contains one C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C bond.\n    *   Total DBE required = 1 (for C=O) + 1 (for C=C) = **2**.\n    *   The molecule must also contain **2 oxygen atoms** to form the carboxylic acid group.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the DBE for each option and check the oxygen count:\n    *   **A) C6H10O2:**\n        *   Oxygen count = 2. (Matches)\n        *   DBE = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. (Matches)\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:**\n        *   Oxygen count = 2. (Matches)\n        *   DBE = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. (Does not match. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid, like hexanoic acid).\n    *   **C) C6H12O:**\n        *   Oxygen count = 1. (Does not match).\n        *   DBE = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1. (Does not match).\n    *   **D) C6H10O:**\n        *   Oxygen count = 1. (Does not match).\n        *   DBE = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2. (DBE matches, but oxygen count is wrong. This would be something like an unsaturated ketone or aldehyde).\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Only the formula **C6H10O2** is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data. It has the correct number of oxygen atoms (2) to be a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carbonyl C=O bond and a C=C double bond. A possible structure for this compound is hexenoic acid (e.g., *trans*-2-hexenoic acid).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is a result of extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the characteristic range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Specifically, a peak at 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ combined with a broad O-H peak is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n### **2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, which supports the conclusion drawn from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass calculation: C (12) + O (16) + O (16) + H (1) = 45 amu.\n*   This fragment provides definitive evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group in the molecule.\n\n### **4. Synthesis and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nFrom the combined spectral data, we have established that the unknown molecule must contain:\n1.  A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which includes a C=O double bond.\n2.  An alkene group (C=C).\n\nThe presence of a double bond or a ring in a molecule corresponds to one degree of unsaturation (DoU). Our unknown has a C=O double bond (1 DoU) and a C=C double bond (1 DoU), so it must have a total of **at least two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DoU for each of the given chemical formulas using the formula:\n**DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)** (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens).\n\n*   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is insufficient. A molecule with this formula (e.g., hexanoic acid) is saturated and does not contain a C=C bond.\n*   **B) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has the correct DoU. However, it only contains one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) that requires two oxygens.\n*   **C) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula has an incorrect DoU and only one oxygen atom.\n*   **D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation and two oxygen atoms. This is perfectly consistent with a molecule containing one alkene (C=C) and one carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. An example would be a hexenoic acid.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe formula C6H10O2 is the only option that satisfies all the evidence from the FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. It has the required two degrees of unsaturation and the necessary two oxygen atoms to be an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\n*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a carboxylic acid dimer, which is broadened due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, specifically one that is part of a carboxylic acid (~1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl-hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic fragmentation pattern for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion.\n\n*   **Synthesis of Spectral Data:**\n    *   The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H, C=O) and Mass Spec (m/z=45) strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   The evidence from FTIR (C=C stretch) and 1H NMR (vinyl-hydrogens) confirms the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (an alkene).\n\n*   **Determining the Correct Formula using Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    Our molecule has:\n    1.  One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid), which accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    2.  One C=C double bond (from the alkene), which accounts for another degree of unsaturation.\n    Therefore, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for the unknown compound is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches the required DoU.\n    *   **C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This does not match. A molecule with this formula and a carboxylic acid group (like hexanoic acid) would be saturated and would not have a C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The molecular formula must contain two oxygen atoms and have two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the carboxylic acid and the alkene functional groups identified in the spectra. Only the formula C6H10O2 meets both of these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis**: The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹, combined with the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C, an alkene).\n2.  **1H NMR Analysis**: The observation of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of the C=C double bond suggested by the FTIR data.\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis**: The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic signature for the carboxyl fragment [COOH]⁺, providing very strong evidence that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n4.  **Putting It Together**: The evidence points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n    *   We are left with B (C6H10O2) and C (C6H12O2). The difference lies in the degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The molecule contains a C=O double bond (from the acid) and a C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means it has **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n5.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation**: The Python script calculated the DoU for the remaining options based on the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   **C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n    *   **C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This does not account for the C=C double bond.\n\n**Conclusion**: The only formula that has two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic feature. A very broad absorption in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is indicative of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is forming hydrogen-bonded dimers. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound very likely contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons (H) directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This piece of data unequivocally confirms the presence of an alkene group, supporting the conclusion from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence for identifying the functional group. We need to determine what chemical fragment has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45.\n        *   Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺:\n            *   Mass = (1 × atomic mass of C) + (2 × atomic mass of O) + (1 × atomic mass of H)\n            *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45.\n        *   This m/z = 45 peak is a classic, very common fragment for carboxylic acids, often formed by alpha-cleavage.\n    *   **Conclusion from Mass Spec:** The presence of a fragment at m/z = 45 strongly supports the identification of the compound as a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize All Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we have strong evidence that the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid** (a molecule containing both an alkene and a carboxylic acid).\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C) `C6H10O` and D) `C6H12O`, which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are now left with two possibilities: A) `C6H10O2` and B) `C6H12O2`.\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we can use the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is:\n        *   `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (for molecules containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   Our spectral data tells us we have one C=C bond (one degree of unsaturation) and one C=O bond (another degree of unsaturation). Therefore, the correct molecule must have a total DoU of 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement for one C=C and one C=O bond.\n        *   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. A compound with this formula would be saturated (no C=C bonds), like hexanoic acid. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data showing an alkene.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The only molecular formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data (carboxylic acid group, alkene group, and a total of two degrees of unsaturation) is `C6H10O2`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct molecular formula.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is caused by hydrogen bonding between molecules. While alcohols also show an O-H stretch, it is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum unequivocally confirms the existence of an alkene functional group in the molecule.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = Mass(C) + Mass(O) + Mass(O) + Mass(H) ≈ 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    This fragmentation strongly reinforces the conclusion that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**4. Determining the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe combined spectral evidence indicates the presence of two key structural features that contribute to the degree of unsaturation:\n*   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid). This accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n*   One C=C double bond (from the alkene). This accounts for a **second degree of unsaturation**.\nTherefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Candidate Formulas:**\nWe can calculate the DoU for each option using the formula:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n(Oxygen atoms do not affect the DoU calculation).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has two oxygen atoms, which is required for a carboxylic acid. The DoU of 2 matches our deductions (one C=O and one C=C). **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is insufficient to account for both a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. While the DoU is correct, this formula only has one oxygen atom. A carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms.\n\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula has both an incorrect DoU and an insufficient number of oxygen atoms.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all provided data, the only molecular formula that accommodates a carboxylic acid group, an alkene group, and the corresponding degree of unsaturation is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe analysis of the spectroscopic data is as follows:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, specifically one found in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for vinyl-hydrogens directly confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) functional group.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at an m/z ratio of 45 is a classic indicator of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺. The mass of COOH is (12 + 16 + 16 + 1) = 45.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\nThe combined data indicates that the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid** (a molecule containing both an alkene and a carboxylic acid).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given molecular formulas:\n\n*   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) requires **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options A (C6H10O) and C (C6H12O).\n*   We are left with B (C6H10O2) and D (C6H12O2). To distinguish between them, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   A carboxylic acid's C=O bond counts as one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   An alkene's C=C bond counts as another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, our target molecule must have **at least two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **For D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This molecule has only one degree of unsaturation. It could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it cannot have the C=C double bond confirmed by the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n*   **For B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This molecule has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accounts for one C=O bond (from the acid) and one C=C bond (from the alkene).\n\nOnly the formula C6H10O2 is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A \"very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers (cm⁻¹)\" is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad unless the sample is very pure and concentrated, and the combination with other peaks points away from a simple alcohol.\n    *   A \"strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹\" is in the characteristic range for a carbonyl (C=O) group. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   A \"strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹\" is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C). Vinyl hydrogens are the protons directly attached to the carbons of the double bond. This corroborates the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A \"fragment peak at m/z = 45\" is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the loss of the carboxyl group as a cation, [COOH]⁺. The mass is calculated as: C (12) + O (16) + O (16) + H (1) = 45.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H, C=O) and Mass Spectrometry (m/z = 45) strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H10O) and C (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: A) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2.\n    *   The evidence from FTIR (C=C stretch) and 1H NMR (vinyl-hydrogens) confirms that the molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond in addition to the carboxylic acid group.\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to Differentiate:**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` for a formula CₓHᵧ (heteroatoms like oxygen don't change the calculation).\n    *   Our molecule has a carboxylic acid group, which contains one C=O double bond. This accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Our molecule also has an alkene group, which contains one C=C double bond. This accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\n6.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation. It would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which does not have a C=C double bond. This contradicts the data.\n    *   **D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which is consistent with having one C=O bond and one C=C bond. A possible structure would be a hexenoic acid.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The spectral data points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The formula C6H10O2 is the only option that contains two oxygen atoms (for the carboxylic acid) and has the correct degree of unsaturation (DoU=2) to account for both the carbonyl (C=O) and alkene (C=C) double bonds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).

This formula has only one degree of unsaturation. While it has two oxygens (enough for a carboxylic acid), a single DBE would be fully accounted for by the C=O in the acid group, leaving no room for the required C=C alkene group. A structure with this formula would be saturated (e.g., hexanoic acid), contradicting the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion:** Only the formula C6H10O2 is consistent with all the provided analytical data, indicating an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\n*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.

It accounts for the two oxygen atoms required for the carboxylic acid, and it has the necessary two degrees of unsaturation to accommodate both the carbonyl group and the alkene group.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid.

The presence of other peaks strongly supports the carboxylic acid assignment.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch of a carboxylic acid (usually 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to \"vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl-hydrogens are the hydrogen atoms directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very strong indicator of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The mass of this fragment is calculated as:\n        *   Carbon (C): ~12 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O): ~16 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O): ~16 amu\n        *   Hydrogen (H): ~1 amu\n        *   Total: 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This fragment, [COOH]⁺, is a classic and stable fragmentation product for carboxylic acids.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H, C=O at 1700) and Mass Spectrometry (m/z = 45 fragment) overwhelmingly points to the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This requires the molecule to have **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   The evidence from FTIR (C=C stretch at 1650) and 1H NMR (vinyl-hydrogens) confirms the presence of at least one **carbon-carbon double bond**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Proposed Formulas using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2). Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n    *   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond. So, we are looking for a formula with DoU ≥ 2.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   **A) C6H12O:** Has only one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. Ruled out. DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is also inconsistent.\n        *   **B) C6H10O:** Has only one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. Ruled out. DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. While the DoU matches, the oxygen count is wrong.\n        *   **C) C6H10O2:** Has two oxygens, consistent with a carboxylic acid. Let's check the DoU: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates one C=C bond and one C=O bond. This option is a perfect match for all the evidence.\n        *   **D) C6H12O2:** Has two oxygens. Let's check the DoU: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 means there is only one pi bond or one ring. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid). This contradicts the evidence for a C=C double bond from FTIR and NMR. Ruled out.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The only formula that fits all the spectral data is C6H10O2. It has the required two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and a degree of unsaturation of 2, which accounts for both the C=C bond and the C=O bond.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid (R-COOH) group. While alcohols also have O-H peaks, they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This frequency is typical for the C=O bond in a carboxylic acid (usually 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n    *Conclusion from FTIR:* The combination of a broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The additional C=C peak indicates the molecule is also unsaturated. Therefore, the unknown compound is likely an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, supporting the conclusion drawn from the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak in the FTIR spectrum.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to find a fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxylic acid group itself:\n        *   Fragment: -COOH\n        *   Mass = (1 x Carbon) + (2 x Oxygen) + (1 x Hydrogen)\n        *   Mass = (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45.\n    *   The observation of a fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very common and strong indicator for a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   Based on all the spectral data, the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms** in its formula. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen.\n    *   Now we must choose between B (C6H10O2) and D (C6H12O2). The difference between them is the presence of an extra C=C double bond or a ring structure, which we can determine using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The formula for DoU for a compound CxHyOz is: `DoU = x + 1 - (y/2)`.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 can account for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid, but it cannot account for the additional C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR. Therefore, this formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the data.\n        *   **For B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. A DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates both the C=O double bond (1 degree of unsaturation) and the C=C double bond (1 degree of unsaturation). This formula is consistent with an unsaturated carboxylic acid containing six carbons (e.g., hexenoic acid).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe evidence from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry all converge to identify the unknown as an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only chemical formula that fits this description by having two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of 2 is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\n*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of an O-H stretching vibration that is undergoing significant hydrogen bonding.

A DoU of 1 is not enough to account for both a C=C bond and a C=O bond. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **C) C6H10O:** This formula has only one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **D) C6H12O:** This formula has only one oxygen atom and a DoU of 1. It is inconsistent with the data for multiple reasons. This option is incorrect.\n\nThe only formula that accommodates all the spectral data—the presence of an unsaturated carboxylic acid—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The peak is very broad due to hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids and appear at higher wavenumbers (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically found at 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The combination of the broad O-H peak and the C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ confirms an alkene is also present.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum explicitly confirms the existence of an alkene in the molecule's structure, which corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to determine the possible composition of a fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. The most common and chemically relevant fragment with m/z = 45 is the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 2*16 + 1 = 45.\n    *   This fragment is very common in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids due to the cleavage of the bond adjacent to the carbonyl group. This finding provides strong support for the conclusion that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Chemical Formulas:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we have deduced that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains both a C=C double bond and a -COOH group.\n    *   Now, we must determine which of the proposed molecular formulas fits this structural description. We can use the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)** for this. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   A C=C double bond accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   A C=O double bond (within the carboxylic acid) accounts for another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, our target molecule must have a total **DoU of at least 2**. It must also have **two oxygen atoms** to form the carboxylic acid group.\n\n5.  **Calculate the DoU for each option:**\n    *   **A) C6H10O2:**\n        *   Contains two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates one C=C bond and one C=O bond. This is a very strong candidate.\n    *   **B) C6H12O:**\n        *   Contains only one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is insufficient for both a C=C and a C=O bond.\n    *   **C) C6H10O:**\n        *   Contains only one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **D) C6H12O2:**\n        *   Contains two oxygen atoms, so it could be a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU only allows for one double bond. If the compound is a carboxylic acid (with a C=O), it cannot also have a C=C double bond. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all spectral data, the only molecular formula that accommodates all the required features—a carboxylic acid group (requiring 2 oxygens and 1 DoU for the C=O) and an alkene group (requiring 1 DoU for the C=C)—is **C6H10O2**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding, which is particularly strong in carboxylic acids (-COOH). It could also be an alcohol (-OH), but the other peaks will help clarify.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.

Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The peak is very broad due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between acid molecules. While alcohols also show an O-H stretch in this region (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹), the extreme broadness combined with the other peaks points more strongly to a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A C=O stretch for a conjugated carboxylic acid typically appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n**FTIR Conclusion:** The data strongly suggests the compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms that the molecule contains an alkene functional group. This corroborates the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to identify a common, stable fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. The most likely candidate is the carboxyl fragment, **[COOH]⁺**.\n    *   Mass = 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45.\n*   This fragment is very characteristic of carboxylic acids upon electron ionization. Its presence provides strong confirmation of the -COOH functional group.\n\n### 4. Synthesis of Evidence and Calculation of Degree of Unsaturation\n\nBased on the combined spectroscopic evidence, we have established that the unknown compound must contain:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH). This functional group contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  An **alkene** group (C=C).\n\nThis allows us to screen the given options:\n*   A) C6H10O (One oxygen) -> Incorrect.\n*   B) C6H10O2 (Two oxygens) -> Possible.\n*   C) C6H12O2 (Two oxygens) -> Possible.\n*   D) C6H12O (One oxygen) -> Incorrect.\n\nNow we must decide between B and C. We can do this by calculating the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**, which tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule. The formula is:\nDoU = C - (H/2) + 1  (for formulas containing only C, H, and O)\n\nOur molecule has a C=C double bond (1 DoU) and a C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid (1 DoU).\nTherefore, the **required DoU is 1 + 1 = 2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n*   **B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n*   **C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This does not match. A compound with this formula could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid, which has one C=O) but cannot also have a C=C double bond.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly the chemical formula **C6H10O2** is consistent with all the analytical data. It accounts for the two oxygen atoms of a carboxylic acid and has the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to include both a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\n*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this peak to be exceptionally broad, often overlapping with C-H stretching absorptions.\n    *   A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Combined with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   A strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) stretch.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (an alkene functional group).\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺. (Atomic masses: C=12, O=16, H=1. So, 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    *   The evidence from all three techniques points to a molecule that is both a carboxylic acid and an alkene. Such a molecule is called an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O), as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with B (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2). To distinguish between these, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The formula for DoU for a compound CxHyOz is `DoU = x - y/2 + 1`.\n        *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains one C=O double bond, which accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n        *   An alkene group (C=C) contains one C=C double bond, which accounts for **another degree of unsaturation**.\n        *   Therefore, our molecule must have a total DoU of at least 2.\n\n*   **Calculating the Degree of Unsaturation for the remaining options:**\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1. This formula represents a saturated molecule with one double bond or one ring. A saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) fits this formula, but it contradicts the NMR and FTIR data showing a C=C bond.\n    *   **C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2. This DoU of 2 is perfectly consistent with a molecule containing one C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C bond (from the alkene).\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The spectroscopic data collectively identifies an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only formula that fits this description is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\n*   **Analysis of FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of an O-H bond stretch, specifically within a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O) stretch. This value is typical for the C=O in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an alkene (C=C) double bond stretch.\n    *   Putting this together, the FTIR data suggests the presence of both a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for vinyl hydrogens directly confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C). Vinyl hydrogens are the protons attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very common and strong indicator for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n*   **Synthesis of Information and Evaluation of Molecular Formulas:**\n    1.  The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen.\n    2.  We are left with C) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2. To distinguish between them, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE), also known as double bond equivalents. The formula for DBE is: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n    3.  From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the carbonyl (C=O) in the carboxylic acid and one for the alkene (C=C). So, we are looking for a formula with a DBE of 2.\n    4.  Let's calculate the DBE for the remaining options:\n        *   For C) C6H12O2: DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This formula only accounts for one double bond (or a ring), which would fit a saturated carboxylic acid, but not one that also contains an alkene.\n        *   For D) C6H10O2: DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This DBE of 2 perfectly matches our findings: one degree of unsaturation for the C=O bond and one for the C=C bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The combined spectroscopic evidence (carboxylic acid + alkene) requires a molecular formula with two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of 2. Only C6H10O2 fits all the criteria. An example of such a compound would be hexenoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of an O-H stretching vibration. The \"very broad\" nature of this peak is highly characteristic of the hydrogen-bonded O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). While alcohols also have O-H groups, their peaks are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The additional peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ shows the compound also contains an alkene group. Therefore, the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the loss of the alkyl chain, leaving behind the positively charged carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺. The mass is calculated as:\n        *   Carbon: 12\n        *   Oxygen: 16\n        *   Oxygen: 16\n        *   Hydrogen: 1\n        *   Total mass = 45\n    *   This provides strong evidence for the carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Data and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   The evidence overwhelmingly points to a molecule that is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the molecule must contain:\n        1.  A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has **two oxygen atoms**.\n        2.  An alkene group (C=C).\n    *   The presence of two oxygen atoms immediately eliminates options C) C6H10O and D) C6H12O.\n    *   We are left with A) C6H10O2 and B) C6H12O2. The difference is the degree of unsaturation (DoU), which reflects the number of rings and/or pi bonds. The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2).\n        *   **For B) C6H12O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n            A DoU of 1 accounts for the one pi bond in the carbonyl (C=O) of the carboxylic acid. This formula represents a **saturated** carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid). It would not have a C=C bond, contradicting the FTIR and NMR data.\n        *   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n            A DoU of 2 is required to have both a carbonyl pi bond (C=O) and an alkene pi bond (C=C). This formula represents an **unsaturated** carboxylic acid, which is perfectly consistent with all the provided spectral data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound must be an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The molecular formula that matches this structural requirement is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n*   **Analysis of FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid.

To distinguish between these two, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each formula and compare it to the unsaturation indicated by the functional groups. The formula for DoU is `C - H/2 + 1` for a compound containing only C, H, and O.\n    4.

Its \"very broad\" nature is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic absorption for a carbonyl (C=O) group.

This strongly confirms the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Findings and Evaluate the Formulas\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence unequivocally indicates that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This single conclusion is reached by all 45 candidate answers, showing extremely high consistency in reasoning.\n\nBased on this conclusion, the molecular formula must satisfy two criteria:\n1.  It must contain **two oxygen atoms** to form the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n2.

Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic feature. A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is the classic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding (dimerization). While alcohols also have a broad O-H peak, it is typically centered higher (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹) and is usually less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the C=O group of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the molecule is also an alkene (i.e., it is unsaturated).\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n\n*   **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the conclusion from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial clue. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45.\n    *   Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   The fragment at m/z = 45 is a very common and diagnostically important fragment for carboxylic acids.\n\n**4. Synthesize All Evidence and Determine the Formula:**\n\n*   The evidence from all three techniques points towards the molecule being an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n*   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C (C₆H₁₀O) and D (C₆H₁₂O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n*   We are left with two possibilities: **C₆H₁₀O₂** and **C₆H₁₂O₂**.\n*   To decide between these two, we use the concept of the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   DoU Formula = C + 1 - (H/2)\n*   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain:\n    1.  One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid). This accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    2.  One C=C double bond (from the alkene group). This accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct formula must have a total DoU of at least 2.\n*   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **For C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This perfectly matches our required two degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   **For C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula only accounts for the C=O bond of a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid) and contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C double bond from both FTIR and NMR.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. It must contain two oxygen atoms and have at least two degrees of unsaturation. Only the formula C₆H₁₀O₂ fits all the experimental data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic absorption for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad unless the sample is very concentrated, and the combination with other peaks points away from a simple alcohol.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, carboxylic acids show a C=O stretch around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a double bond. The presence of these peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, which corroborates the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. We can calculate its mass: Carbon (12) + Oxygen (16) + Oxygen (16) + Hydrogen (1) = 45. This corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ fragment ion. The presence of this fragment is very strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   From FTIR and Mass Spec, we have confirmed a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH). This group contains two oxygen atoms and one C=O double bond.\n    *   From FTIR and 1H NMR, we have confirmed a **C=C double bond** (alkene).\n\n5.  **Determine the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   A molecule's structure must account for all the identified features. The presence of one C=O double bond contributes one degree of unsaturation. The presence of one C=C double bond contributes another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for the molecule is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formula Options:**\n    *   The general formula for calculating the Degree of Unsaturation is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect this calculation.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for each option and see if it has two oxygens (for the carboxylic acid) and a DoU of 2.\n\n    *   **A) C6H10O:**\n        *   Oxygens: 1. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. The DoU is correct, but the number of oxygens is not.\n\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:**\n        *   Oxygens: 2. This is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This is inconsistent. A DoU of 1 would mean only one double bond (the C=O of the acid) and no C=C bond, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n    *   **C) C6H12O:**\n        *   Oxygens: 1. Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.

It has the correct number of oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carboxylic acid's C=O bond and the alkene's C=C bond. An example of such a compound would be hexenoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The \"very broad\" nature of this peak is highly characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH), where hydrogen bonding causes significant peak broadening.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically found around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n*Conclusion from FTIR:* The combination of a very broad O-H peak, a C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, and a C=C peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ strongly suggests the compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl-hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n*Conclusion from ¹H NMR:* The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass of C = ~12 amu\n    *   Mass of O = ~16 amu\n    *   Mass of H = ~1 amu\n    *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   This fragmentation provides strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n*Conclusion from Mass Spec:* The compound contains a -COOH group.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   From the analysis, we have established that the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecular formula must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O).\n*   We are left with two options: A) C₆H₁₀O₂ and C) C₆H₁₂O₂.\n*   The presence of a C=C double bond (an alkene) means the molecule is unsaturated. We can confirm which formula is correct by calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The formula for DoU is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n*   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **For C₆H₁₀O₂ (Option A):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. A DoU of 2 is consistent with one C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C bond (from the alkene). This fits all our spectral evidence.\n    *   **For C₆H₁₂O₂ (Option C):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. This would mean the carbon chain is saturated (no C=C bond or rings), which contradicts the FTIR and ¹H NMR data showing an alkene is present.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only molecular formula that accounts for all the spectral evidence—a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond—is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAll the analytical data point to the same conclusion. Let's summarize the evidence:\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ combined with the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is definitive evidence for a **carboxylic acid** functional group (-COOH).\n    *   The strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (**alkene**, C=C).\n\n2.  **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of the **alkene** group suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The fragment peak at m/z = 45 corresponds to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong confirmation of the **carboxylic acid** group.\n\n**Putting it all together:**\n*   The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the formula must contain two oxygen atoms, eliminating options C (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n*   We must now decide between **A) C6H10O2** and **B) C6H12O2**.\n*   The molecule has one double bond from the carbonyl (C=O) in the carboxylic acid and a second double bond from the alkene (C=C). This means the molecule has a **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2**.\n\nThe code calculated the DoU for the remaining options:\n*   **C6H10O2:** DoU = 2\n*   **C6H12O2:** DoU = 1\n\nThe molecular formula C6H10O2 has a Degree of Unsaturation of 2, which perfectly matches the required two double bonds (one C=O and one C=C). The formula C6H12O2 has a DoU of 1, which could only account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond, not the additional C=C bond.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating that the molecule is an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The presence of these signals in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene group, which corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n    *   The observation of a fragment at m/z = 45 is strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group, which readily fragments to form the stable [COOH]⁺ cation.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Information and Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   From the combined data, we can conclude that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This allows us to immediately eliminate options A (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are now left with two possibilities: B (C₆H₁₀O₂) and C (C₆H₁₂O₂).\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), also known as the Double Bond Equivalent (DBE). The formula for a compound with C carbons and H hydrogens is: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1.\n    *   Our structural analysis showed the presence of one C=C double bond (1 degree of unsaturation) and one C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid group (1 degree of unsaturation). Therefore, the total DoU for the molecule must be 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   For **B) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**.\n        *   For **C) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**.\n    *   The calculated DoU for C₆H₁₀O₂ is 2, which perfectly matches the structural features identified from the spectra (one C=C and one C=O). The DoU for C₆H₁₂O₂ is 1, which would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid), contradicting the evidence for a C=C double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The combination of this C=O peak and the broad O-H peak is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens (hydrogens attached to the carbons of a double bond) confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic and very common fragment for carboxylic acids. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ cation (Carbon = 12, Oxygen = 16, Hydrogen = 1; Total mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n4.  **Integration of the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   The combined data from all three techniques strongly indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains a C=C double bond.\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains two oxygen atoms. This information allows us to immediately eliminate options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), as they only contain one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are now left with two possibilities: B) C6H10O2 and C) C6H12O2.\n\n5.  **Using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of pi bonds and rings within a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n    *   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain at least one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond. This means the molecule must have a Degree of Unsaturation of at least 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This value is consistent with the presence of one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n        *   **For C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This value is not consistent with the presence of both a C=O and a C=C bond. A molecule with this formula could be a carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it could not also contain a C=C double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only chemical formula that accounts for all the experimental evidence (a carboxylic acid group and a C=C double bond) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe reasoning and thinking process has already been generated in the previous turn.

This eliminates options A and B.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The molecule has one C=O double bond (DoU=1) and one C=C double bond (DoU=1), for a total required DoU of 2.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Remaining Options:**\n    *   **C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This only accounts for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond, not the alkene C=C bond. This is incorrect.\n    *   **D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This accounts for both the C=O and the C=C double bonds. This is correct.\n\nThe code output confirms this analysis, showing that only option D has both 2 oxygen atoms and a Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1.

A peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group within a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The additional C=C peak indicates the molecule is unsaturated.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum unequivocally confirms the existence of an alkene group in the molecule, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the most likely candidate, the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺).\n    *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + (2 * 16) + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This is a perfect match and a very common and diagnostically significant fragment for carboxylic acids. This provides strong confirmation for the presence of a -COOH group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we have definitively identified two functional groups in the unknown compound: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options C) C6H10O and D) C6H12O, which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with A) C6H10O2 and B) C6H12O2.\n    *   To differentiate between these two, we can use the concept of the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   Our identified functional groups require at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=C double bond and one for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid. So, we expect DoU = 2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our requirement for one C=C bond and one C=O bond.\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This DoU of 1 would correspond to a molecule with only one double bond (the C=O of the carboxylic acid), meaning it would be a saturated carboxylic acid. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data, which prove the existence of a C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence (presence of a carboxylic acid, presence of an alkene, and the corresponding degree of unsaturation) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. While alcohols also have a broad O-H stretch, it's typically centered higher (around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹) and is less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The position is consistent with the carbonyl stretch in a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch, a C=O stretch, and a C=C stretch strongly suggests that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the conclusion drawn from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to identify a common fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. The mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as:\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This m/z = 45 peak is a characteristic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ ion. This provides very strong confirmation that the molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Combine the Evidence and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the analysis, we know the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options **C) C6H10O** and **D) C6H12O**, as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with **A) C6H10O2** and **B) C6H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 (for compounds with C, H, and O).\n    *   Our spectroscopic data tells us we have:\n        *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid). This contributes 1 to the DoU.\n        *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene). This contributes another 1 to the DoU.\n    *   Therefore, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for our molecule is 1 + 1 = **2**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n    *   **For B) C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which only has the C=O double bond. It does not account for the C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to a molecule with a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond. This requires two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of 2. Only the formula **C6H10O2** satisfies all these conditions.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between acid molecules. An alcohol O-H is also in this region but is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically observed around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n    *Conclusion from FTIR:* The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).

Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group, -COOH.\n        *   Mass = (1 x Carbon) + (2 x Oxygen) + (1 x Hydrogen)\n        *   Mass ≈ (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   The [COOH]⁺ fragment is a very common and stable fragment observed in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids. This piece of data provides strong confirmation for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we have concluded that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B) C6H12O and C) C6H10O, which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with A) C6H10O2 and D) C6H12O2. To distinguish between these, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n    *   Our molecule has one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means it must have a total of **2 degrees of unsaturation**.\n\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For D) C6H12O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n            This formula corresponds to a molecule with only one degree of unsaturation. This would represent a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), where the only pi bond is the C=O. This contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond.\n        *   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n            This formula corresponds to a molecule with two degrees of unsaturation. This perfectly accommodates one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond, consistent with all the spectral evidence. An example structure would be hexenoic acid.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The evidence from all three characterization techniques points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid. Only the formula C6H10O2 has the required two oxygen atoms and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carbonyl and the alkene functional groups.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

This supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is observed. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with this mass.\n    *   Let's calculate the mass of the carboxylic acid functional group, -COOH:\n        *   Mass = (1 x Carbon) + (2 x Oxygen) + (1 x Hydrogen)\n        *   Mass = (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n    *   The fragment `[COOH]+` has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, providing strong evidence for this functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined data, we know the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid** (it has an alkene and a carboxylic acid).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group requires **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), which only have one oxygen.\n    *   We now need to decide between A (C₆H₁₂O₂) and B (C₆H₁₀O₂). We can use the **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)** to do this. The DBE indicates the total number of rings and/or double bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DBE is: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)` (for molecules containing C, H, and O).\n    *   Our molecule has a C=O double bond (from the acid) and a C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means it must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation (DBE = 2)**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DBE for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DBE value only accounts for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid but not the required C=C double bond.\n        *   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DBE value perfectly accounts for both the C=O double bond and the C=C double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemical formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** is the only one that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence: it has two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid and two degrees of unsaturation for the required C=O and C=C double bonds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.

Analysis of Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules. While alcohols also show an O-H stretch, it is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with a very broad O-H stretch, it strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene, which is consistent with the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a plausible chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45.

This strongly confirms the presence of the -COOH functional group.\n\n**4. Synthesis and Calculation of Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n\nThe spectroscopic data reveals that the unknown molecule must contain:\n1.  A C=C double bond (from FTIR and NMR). This accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n2.  A C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid group (from FTIR and MS). This accounts for a **second degree of unsaturation**.\n\nTherefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total of **2 degrees of unsaturation**. It must also contain at least two oxygen atoms to form the carboxylic acid group.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for each of the given options using the formula: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This formula has two oxygen atoms and the required 2 degrees of unsaturation. This is a perfect match.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This formula only has one oxygen and an incorrect DoU.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This formula has an incorrect DoU; it would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. While the DoU is correct, this formula only has one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with the clear evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the provided data (presence of a carboxylic acid, an alkene, and a total of 2 degrees of unsaturation) is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\n**Final Answer Rationale:**\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:** The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ combined with the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The presence of two oxygen atoms is implied. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), meaning the molecule is unsaturated.\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:** The observation of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of the C=C double bond suggested by the FTIR data.\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:** A fragment at m/z = 45 is the mass of the carboxyl cation ([COOH]⁺), providing strong confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n4.  **Formula Determination:**\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must have two oxygen atoms. This narrows the choices down to **A) C₆H₁₀O₂** and **C) C₆H₁₂O₂**.\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) must account for both the C=O bond in the acid and the C=C bond of the alkene. This means the molecule has a DoU of 2.\n    *   Calculating the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This matches the spectroscopic evidence.\n        *   **C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid, which contradicts the evidence of a C=C bond.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the data is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is a hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. For a carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly suggests the presence of both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group in the molecule.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum provides direct confirmation of the alkene functional group that was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH):\n    *   Mass = (1 x mass of C) + (2 x mass of O) + (1 x mass of H)\n    *   Mass = (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n*   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 corresponding to [COOH]⁺ is a very common and diagnostically significant fragment for carboxylic acids.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options**\n\n*   From the combined spectroscopic evidence, we can definitively say that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a C=C double bond.\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid group means the molecule must have **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O).\n*   We are left with two options: C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. To distinguish between them, we calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C - (H/2) + 1` (for a formula containing only C, H, and O).\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **For C6H12O2 (Option C):**\n    *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**\n    *   A DoU of 1 means there is one double bond or one ring. The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group accounts for this single degree of unsaturation. This formula would correspond to a *saturated* carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C double bond.\n\n*   **For C6H10O2 (Option B):**\n    *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**\n    *   A DoU of 2 is required to account for two double bonds. Our spectroscopic analysis identified one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond. This formula perfectly matches all the evidence.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence from all three techniques points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the formula C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere's my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:** I'll analyze each piece of evidence provided.\n\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n        *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for an O-H stretch. The broadness is key; it strongly suggests the O-H is part of a carboxylic acid due to hydrogen bonding, which creates a very wide absorption band. An alcohol O-H stretch is also in this region but is typically less broad.\n        *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Paired with the broad O-H peak, a carboxylic acid (C=O stretch ~1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is the most likely candidate.\n        *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** This explicitly confirms the presence of hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This reinforces the conclusion from the 1650 cm⁻¹ FTIR peak.\n\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n        *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** I need to identify what common fragment has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the functional group we suspect: the carboxyl group (-COOH).\n            *   Carbon (C) ≈ 12 amu\n            *   Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 amu\n            *   Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1 amu\n            *   Mass of -COOH = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n        *   This m/z = 45 peak is a very strong confirmation for a carboxylic acid, as the cleavage of the bond next to the carbonyl group (alpha-cleavage) to lose the -COOH group is a common fragmentation pathway.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This accounts for the broad O-H, the C=O at 1700 cm⁻¹, and the m/z=45 fragment. It also means the molecule must contain at least two oxygen atoms.\n    *   The compound contains a carbon-carbon double bond (alkene). This accounts for the C=C peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ and the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR.\n\n    Therefore, the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formula Options using Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula for a compound with C, H, and O is:\n    DoU = C - (H/2) + 1\n\n    My analysis indicates the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C alkene. Let's calculate the DoU for each option.\n\n    *   **A) C6H10O2:**\n        *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2.\n        *   This fits our requirement for two degrees of unsaturation. It also has two oxygen atoms, which is required for a carboxylic acid. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **B) C6H10O:**\n        *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2.\n        *   While it has the correct DoU, it only has one oxygen. This would make it an unsaturated ketone or aldehyde, which is less consistent with the very broad O-H peak and the m/z=45 fragment characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **C) C6H12O2:**\n        *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1.\n        *   This has only one degree of unsaturation. It could be a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid), but it cannot have the C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n\n    *   **D) C6H12O:**\n        *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1.\n        *   This has only one degree of unsaturation and one oxygen. This could be a saturated ketone/aldehyde or an unsaturated alcohol, neither of which fits all the data.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The formula **C6H10O2** is the only one that satisfies all the experimental evidence:\n    *   It has two oxygens, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   It has two degrees of unsaturation, accommodating one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data:\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:** The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹, coupled with a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, is definitive evidence for a **carboxylic acid** functional group (-COOH). The additional peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (**alkene**, C=C).\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:** The observation of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the existence of the C=C double bond.\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:** The fragment at m/z = 45 is a characteristic fragment for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the `[COOH]+` ion.\n4.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:** The molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and an alkene group (C=C), meaning it must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation**. A carboxylic acid also requires **two oxygen atoms**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options against these requirements:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O:** Has only 1 oxygen atom. Incorrect.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:** Has 2 oxygen atoms but only 1 degree of unsaturation (DoU = 6 - 12/2 + 1 = 1). This would be a saturated carboxylic acid, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data showing a C=C bond. Incorrect.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O:** Has only 1 oxygen atom and 1 degree of unsaturation. Incorrect.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:** Has 2 oxygen atoms and 2 degrees of unsaturation (DoU = 6 - 10/2 + 1 = 2). This formula perfectly accounts for a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group (an alkenoic acid). **Correct.**\n\nThus, the only formula that fits all the evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). It can also indicate an alcohol (-OH), but the broadness is usually more pronounced for carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The combination of a very broad O-H peak and a C=O peak strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The presence of a C=C peak indicates the molecule is unsaturated.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to the carbons of a double bond (H-C=C). This piece of data explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which corroborates the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to determine the possible atomic composition of a fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. We will use the integer masses of the most common isotopes (C=12, H=1, O=16).\n    *   Let's test some combinations:\n        *   C₃H₉⁺: (3 * 12) + 9 = 36 + 9 = 45. This is the propyl cation.\n        *   C₂H₅O⁺: (2 * 12) + 5 + 16 = 24 + 5 + 16 = 45. This is an ethoxy or hydroxyethyl fragment.\n        *   COOH⁺: 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45. This corresponds to the carboxyl group fragment.\n    *   Given the strong evidence for a carboxylic acid from the FTIR data, the fragment at m/z = 45 is almost certainly the [COOH]⁺ fragment. This provides powerful confirmation of the carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize All Information:**\n    *   From FTIR and Mass Spec, we have identified a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**. This functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   From FTIR and 1H NMR, we have identified a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas using the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (or Double Bond Equivalent) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is `DBE = C - H/2 + 1` (for molecules containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   Our molecule contains one C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C bond.\n    *   Total DBE required = 1 (for C=O) + 1 (for C=C) = **2**.\n    *   The molecule must also contain **2 oxygen atoms** to form the carboxylic acid group.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the DBE for each option and check the oxygen count:\n    *   **A) C6H10O2:**\n        *   Oxygen count = 2. (Matches)\n        *   DBE = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. (Matches)\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:**\n        *   Oxygen count = 2. (Matches)\n        *   DBE = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. (Does not match. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid, like hexanoic acid).\n    *   **C) C6H12O:**\n        *   Oxygen count = 1. (Does not match).\n        *   DBE = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1. (Does not match).\n    *   **D) C6H10O:**\n        *   Oxygen count = 1. (Does not match).\n        *   DBE = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2. (DBE matches, but oxygen count is wrong. This would be something like an unsaturated ketone or aldehyde).\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Only the formula **C6H10O2** is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data. It has the correct number of oxygen atoms (2) to be a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carbonyl C=O bond and a C=C double bond. A possible structure for this compound is hexenoic acid (e.g., *trans*-2-hexenoic acid).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is a result of extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the characteristic range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Specifically, a peak at 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ combined with a broad O-H peak is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n### **2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, which supports the conclusion drawn from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass calculation: C (12) + O (16) + O (16) + H (1) = 45 amu.\n*   This fragment provides definitive evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group in the molecule.\n\n### **4. Synthesis and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nFrom the combined spectral data, we have established that the unknown molecule must contain:\n1.  A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which includes a C=O double bond.\n2.  An alkene group (C=C).\n\nThe presence of a double bond or a ring in a molecule corresponds to one degree of unsaturation (DoU). Our unknown has a C=O double bond (1 DoU) and a C=C double bond (1 DoU), so it must have a total of **at least two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DoU for each of the given chemical formulas using the formula:\n**DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)** (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens).\n\n*   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is insufficient. A molecule with this formula (e.g., hexanoic acid) is saturated and does not contain a C=C bond.\n*   **B) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has the correct DoU. However, it only contains one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) that requires two oxygens.\n*   **C) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula has an incorrect DoU and only one oxygen atom.\n*   **D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation and two oxygen atoms. This is perfectly consistent with a molecule containing one alkene (C=C) and one carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. An example would be a hexenoic acid.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe formula C6H10O2 is the only option that satisfies all the evidence from the FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. It has the required two degrees of unsaturation and the necessary two oxygen atoms to be an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\n*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a carboxylic acid dimer, which is broadened due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, specifically one that is part of a carboxylic acid (~1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl-hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic fragmentation pattern for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion.\n\n*   **Synthesis of Spectral Data:**\n    *   The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H, C=O) and Mass Spec (m/z=45) strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   The evidence from FTIR (C=C stretch) and 1H NMR (vinyl-hydrogens) confirms the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (an alkene).\n\n*   **Determining the Correct Formula using Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    Our molecule has:\n    1.  One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid), which accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    2.  One C=C double bond (from the alkene), which accounts for another degree of unsaturation.\n    Therefore, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for the unknown compound is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches the required DoU.\n    *   **C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This does not match. A molecule with this formula and a carboxylic acid group (like hexanoic acid) would be saturated and would not have a C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The molecular formula must contain two oxygen atoms and have two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the carboxylic acid and the alkene functional groups identified in the spectra. Only the formula C6H10O2 meets both of these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis**: The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹, combined with the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C, an alkene).\n2.  **1H NMR Analysis**: The observation of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of the C=C double bond suggested by the FTIR data.\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis**: The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic signature for the carboxyl fragment [COOH]⁺, providing very strong evidence that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n4.  **Putting It Together**: The evidence points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n    *   We are left with B (C6H10O2) and C (C6H12O2). The difference lies in the degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The molecule contains a C=O double bond (from the acid) and a C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means it has **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n5.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation**: The Python script calculated the DoU for the remaining options based on the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   **C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n    *   **C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This does not account for the C=C double bond.\n\n**Conclusion**: The only formula that has two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic feature. A very broad absorption in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is indicative of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is forming hydrogen-bonded dimers. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound very likely contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons (H) directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This piece of data unequivocally confirms the presence of an alkene group, supporting the conclusion from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence for identifying the functional group. We need to determine what chemical fragment has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45.\n        *   Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺:\n            *   Mass = (1 × atomic mass of C) + (2 × atomic mass of O) + (1 × atomic mass of H)\n            *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45.\n        *   This m/z = 45 peak is a classic, very common fragment for carboxylic acids, often formed by alpha-cleavage.\n    *   **Conclusion from Mass Spec:** The presence of a fragment at m/z = 45 strongly supports the identification of the compound as a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize All Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we have strong evidence that the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid** (a molecule containing both an alkene and a carboxylic acid).\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C) `C6H10O` and D) `C6H12O`, which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are now left with two possibilities: A) `C6H10O2` and B) `C6H12O2`.\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we can use the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is:\n        *   `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (for molecules containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   Our spectral data tells us we have one C=C bond (one degree of unsaturation) and one C=O bond (another degree of unsaturation). Therefore, the correct molecule must have a total DoU of 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement for one C=C and one C=O bond.\n        *   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. A compound with this formula would be saturated (no C=C bonds), like hexanoic acid. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data showing an alkene.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The only molecular formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data (carboxylic acid group, alkene group, and a total of two degrees of unsaturation) is `C6H10O2`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct molecular formula.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is caused by hydrogen bonding between molecules. While alcohols also show an O-H stretch, it is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum unequivocally confirms the existence of an alkene functional group in the molecule.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = Mass(C) + Mass(O) + Mass(O) + Mass(H) ≈ 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    This fragmentation strongly reinforces the conclusion that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**4. Determining the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe combined spectral evidence indicates the presence of two key structural features that contribute to the degree of unsaturation:\n*   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid). This accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n*   One C=C double bond (from the alkene). This accounts for a **second degree of unsaturation**.\nTherefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Candidate Formulas:**\nWe can calculate the DoU for each option using the formula:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n(Oxygen atoms do not affect the DoU calculation).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has two oxygen atoms, which is required for a carboxylic acid. The DoU of 2 matches our deductions (one C=O and one C=C). **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is insufficient to account for both a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. While the DoU is correct, this formula only has one oxygen atom. A carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms.\n\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula has both an incorrect DoU and an insufficient number of oxygen atoms.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all provided data, the only molecular formula that accommodates a carboxylic acid group, an alkene group, and the corresponding degree of unsaturation is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe analysis of the spectroscopic data is as follows:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, specifically one found in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for vinyl-hydrogens directly confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) functional group.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at an m/z ratio of 45 is a classic indicator of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺. The mass of COOH is (12 + 16 + 16 + 1) = 45.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\nThe combined data indicates that the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid** (a molecule containing both an alkene and a carboxylic acid).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given molecular formulas:\n\n*   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) requires **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options A (C6H10O) and C (C6H12O).\n*   We are left with B (C6H10O2) and D (C6H12O2). To distinguish between them, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   A carboxylic acid's C=O bond counts as one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   An alkene's C=C bond counts as another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, our target molecule must have **at least two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **For D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This molecule has only one degree of unsaturation. It could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it cannot have the C=C double bond confirmed by the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n*   **For B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This molecule has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accounts for one C=O bond (from the acid) and one C=C bond (from the alkene).\n\nOnly the formula C6H10O2 is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A \"very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers (cm⁻¹)\" is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad unless the sample is very pure and concentrated, and the combination with other peaks points away from a simple alcohol.\n    *   A \"strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹\" is in the characteristic range for a carbonyl (C=O) group. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   A \"strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹\" is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C). Vinyl hydrogens are the protons directly attached to the carbons of the double bond. This corroborates the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A \"fragment peak at m/z = 45\" is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the loss of the carboxyl group as a cation, [COOH]⁺. The mass is calculated as: C (12) + O (16) + O (16) + H (1) = 45.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H, C=O) and Mass Spectrometry (m/z = 45) strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H10O) and C (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: A) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2.\n    *   The evidence from FTIR (C=C stretch) and 1H NMR (vinyl-hydrogens) confirms that the molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond in addition to the carboxylic acid group.\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to Differentiate:**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` for a formula CₓHᵧ (heteroatoms like oxygen don't change the calculation).\n    *   Our molecule has a carboxylic acid group, which contains one C=O double bond. This accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Our molecule also has an alkene group, which contains one C=C double bond. This accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\n6.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation. It would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which does not have a C=C double bond. This contradicts the data.\n    *   **D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which is consistent with having one C=O bond and one C=C bond. A possible structure would be a hexenoic acid.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The spectral data points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The formula C6H10O2 is the only option that contains two oxygen atoms (for the carboxylic acid) and has the correct degree of unsaturation (DoU=2) to account for both the carbonyl (C=O) and alkene (C=C) double bonds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).

This formula has only one degree of unsaturation. While it has two oxygens (enough for a carboxylic acid), a single DBE would be fully accounted for by the C=O in the acid group, leaving no room for the required C=C alkene group. A structure with this formula would be saturated (e.g., hexanoic acid), contradicting the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion:** Only the formula C6H10O2 is consistent with all the provided analytical data, indicating an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\n*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.

While the DoU matches, the oxygen count is wrong.\n        *   **C) C6H10O2:** Has two oxygens, consistent with a carboxylic acid. Let's check the DoU: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates one C=C bond and one C=O bond. This option is a perfect match for all the evidence.\n        *   **D) C6H12O2:** Has two oxygens. Let's check the DoU: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 means there is only one pi bond or one ring. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid). This contradicts the evidence for a C=C double bond from FTIR and NMR. Ruled out.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The only formula that fits all the spectral data is C6H10O2. It has the required two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and a degree of unsaturation of 2, which accounts for both the C=C bond and the C=O bond.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid (R-COOH) group. While alcohols also have O-H peaks, they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This frequency is typical for the C=O bond in a carboxylic acid (usually 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n    *Conclusion from FTIR:* The combination of a broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The additional C=C peak indicates the molecule is also unsaturated. Therefore, the unknown compound is likely an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, supporting the conclusion drawn from the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak in the FTIR spectrum.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to find a fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxylic acid group itself:\n        *   Fragment: -COOH\n        *   Mass = (1 x Carbon) + (2 x Oxygen) + (1 x Hydrogen)\n        *   Mass = (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45.\n    *   The observation of a fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very common and strong indicator for a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   Based on all the spectral data, the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms** in its formula. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen.\n    *   Now we must choose between B (C6H10O2) and D (C6H12O2). The difference between them is the presence of an extra C=C double bond or a ring structure, which we can determine using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The formula for DoU for a compound CxHyOz is: `DoU = x + 1 - (y/2)`.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 can account for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid, but it cannot account for the additional C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR. Therefore, this formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the data.\n        *   **For B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. A DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates both the C=O double bond (1 degree of unsaturation) and the C=C double bond (1 degree of unsaturation). This formula is consistent with an unsaturated carboxylic acid containing six carbons (e.g., hexenoic acid).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe evidence from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry all converge to identify the unknown as an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only chemical formula that fits this description by having two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of 2 is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\n*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of an O-H stretching vibration that is undergoing significant hydrogen bonding. This is most characteristic of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), although alcohols can also show broad peaks here.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carboxylic acid's carbonyl group.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), i.e., an alkene.\n    *   Combining these three peaks strongly suggests the presence of an unsaturated carboxylic acid (a molecule containing both a C=C bond and a -COOH group).\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which supports the conclusion drawn from the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak in the FTIR spectrum.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very strong indicator of the presence of a carboxyl group. The [COOH]⁺ fragment has a mass of approximately 45 amu (Atomic Mass Units).\n    *   Mass calculation: Carbon (≈12) + Oxygen (≈16) + Oxygen (≈16) + Hydrogen (≈1) = 45.\n\n*   **Putting it all together (Degree of Unsaturation):**\n    *   The evidence points to a molecule containing two key features: a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group.\n    *   A double bond (C=C) or a ring counts as one degree of unsaturation (DoU).\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) also counts as one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, our molecule must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation**: one for the C=C bond and one for the C=O bond within the carboxylic acid.\n    *   The carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   Let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each formula using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n    *   **A) C6H10O2:** This formula has two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 matches our requirement for one C=C bond and one C=O bond. This is a perfect fit for the data.\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:** This formula has two oxygen atoms.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. A DoU of 1 is not enough to account for both a C=C bond and a C=O bond. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **C) C6H10O:** This formula has only one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **D) C6H12O:** This formula has only one oxygen atom and a DoU of 1. It is inconsistent with the data for multiple reasons. This option is incorrect.\n\nThe only formula that accommodates all the spectral data—the presence of an unsaturated carboxylic acid—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The peak is very broad due to hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids and appear at higher wavenumbers (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically found at 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The combination of the broad O-H peak and the C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ confirms an alkene is also present.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum explicitly confirms the existence of an alkene in the molecule's structure, which corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to determine the possible composition of a fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. The most common and chemically relevant fragment with m/z = 45 is the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 2*16 + 1 = 45.\n    *   This fragment is very common in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids due to the cleavage of the bond adjacent to the carbonyl group. This finding provides strong support for the conclusion that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Chemical Formulas:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we have deduced that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains both a C=C double bond and a -COOH group.\n    *   Now, we must determine which of the proposed molecular formulas fits this structural description. We can use the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)** for this. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   A C=C double bond accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   A C=O double bond (within the carboxylic acid) accounts for another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, our target molecule must have a total **DoU of at least 2**. It must also have **two oxygen atoms** to form the carboxylic acid group.\n\n5.  **Calculate the DoU for each option:**\n    *   **A) C6H10O2:**\n        *   Contains two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates one C=C bond and one C=O bond. This is a very strong candidate.\n    *   **B) C6H12O:**\n        *   Contains only one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is insufficient for both a C=C and a C=O bond.\n    *   **C) C6H10O:**\n        *   Contains only one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **D) C6H12O2:**\n        *   Contains two oxygen atoms, so it could be a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU only allows for one double bond. If the compound is a carboxylic acid (with a C=O), it cannot also have a C=C double bond. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all spectral data, the only molecular formula that accommodates all the required features—a carboxylic acid group (requiring 2 oxygens and 1 DoU for the C=O) and an alkene group (requiring 1 DoU for the C=C)—is **C6H10O2**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding, which is particularly strong in carboxylic acids (-COOH). It could also be an alcohol (-OH), but the other peaks will help clarify.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This, combined with the broad O-H stretch, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This information confirms the presence of an alkene group, supporting the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of information. We need to identify a common, stable fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. The most likely candidate is the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Let's calculate its mass: Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + (2 * 16) + 1 = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45.\n    *   The presence of a fragment at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   From FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, we have strong evidence for a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH).\n    *   From FTIR and ¹H NMR, we have confirmed the presence of an **alkene** group (C=C).\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid group contains **two** oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options C) C₆H₁₂O and D) C₆H₁₀O, as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with A) C₆H₁₂O₂ and B) C₆H₁₀O₂.\n    *   Now, we must use the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to differentiate between them. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in the molecule. Our analysis indicates the molecule must contain at least two double bonds: one C=O from the acid and one C=C from the alkene. This means the molecule must have a DoU of at least 2.\n    *   The formula for Degree of Unsaturation is: DoU = C - H/2 + 1 (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens).\n    *   Let's check the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12 / 2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1.\n        *   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10 / 2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The experimental data requires a molecule with a Degree of Unsaturation of 2 (one for the C=O and one for the C=C). Only the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** has a DoU of 2. Therefore, this is the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is a hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is unsaturated.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum provides definitive proof of a C=C double bond, confirming the conclusion from the FTIR spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of a carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as:\n    *   Mass of Carbon (C) = 12 amu\n    *   Mass of two Oxygens (O x 2) = 16 x 2 = 32 amu\n    *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) = 1 amu\n    *   **Total Mass = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu**\n    *   The observation of a fragment at m/z = 45 is extremely strong evidence that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The compound contains a -COOH group.\n\n### **4. Synthesis and Evaluation of Molecular Formulas**\n\nBased on the combined evidence, the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Identify the necessary atoms:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options **A) C6H10O** and **C) C6H12O**, which only contain one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with **B) C6H12O2** and **D) C6H10O2**.\n\n*   **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to differentiate:**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DBE is: `DBE = C - (H/2) + 1` (for a formula containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule contains at least **two** sources of unsaturation: one from the carbonyl (C=O) in the carboxylic acid and one from the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). Therefore, the correct formula must have a **DBE of at least 2**.\n\n*   **Calculate DBE for the remaining options:**\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:** DBE = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This DBE value only accounts for the C=O in the carboxylic acid, implying the carbon chain is saturated. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n    *   **D) C6H10O2:** DBE = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This DBE value perfectly matches our findings: one degree of unsaturation for the C=O bond and a second for the C=C bond.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe formula C6H10O2 is the only one that fits all the spectral data: a six-carbon molecule containing a carboxylic acid group (2 oxygens, 1 DBE) and a C=C double bond (1 DBE), for a total of 2 degrees of unsaturation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nMy apologies, there was an indentation typo in the generated Python script which caused it to fail. However, the reasoning leading to the conclusion remains valid and can be completed without the script. Let me briefly restate the core logic.\n\n1.  **Functional Groups Identified:**\n    *   FTIR (broad ~3000 cm⁻¹, strong 1700 cm⁻¹) + Mass Spec (m/z=45) strongly indicate a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group. This group contains one C=O double bond. The presence of a -COOH group means the molecule must have **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   FTIR (1650 cm⁻¹) + ¹H NMR (vinyl-hydrogens) indicate a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**.\n\n2.  **Required Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   A C=O double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   A C=C double bond counts as another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total of **DoU = 2**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on DoU:**\n    The formula for DoU (for CxHyOz) is: `DoU = x - (y/2) + 1`\n\n    *   A) C6H12O2: DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. (Incorrect, not enough unsaturation)\n    *   B) C6H12O: Has only one oxygen. (Incorrect, needs two for -COOH)\n    *   C) C6H10O: Has only one oxygen. (Incorrect, needs two for -COOH)\n    *   D) C6H10O2: DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. (Correct, matches the required DoU for a C=O and a C=C bond).\n\nThis calculation confirms that only the formula C6H10O2 fits all the analytical data provided.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The peak is very broad due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between acid molecules. While alcohols also show an O-H stretch in this region (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹), the extreme broadness combined with the other peaks points more strongly to a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A C=O stretch for a conjugated carboxylic acid typically appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n**FTIR Conclusion:** The data strongly suggests the compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms that the molecule contains an alkene functional group. This corroborates the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to identify a common, stable fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. The most likely candidate is the carboxyl fragment, **[COOH]⁺**.\n    *   Mass = 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45.\n*   This fragment is very characteristic of carboxylic acids upon electron ionization. Its presence provides strong confirmation of the -COOH functional group.\n\n### 4. Synthesis of Evidence and Calculation of Degree of Unsaturation\n\nBased on the combined spectroscopic evidence, we have established that the unknown compound must contain:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH). This functional group contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  An **alkene** group (C=C).\n\nThis allows us to screen the given options:\n*   A) C6H10O (One oxygen) -> Incorrect.\n*   B) C6H10O2 (Two oxygens) -> Possible.\n*   C) C6H12O2 (Two oxygens) -> Possible.\n*   D) C6H12O (One oxygen) -> Incorrect.\n\nNow we must decide between B and C. We can do this by calculating the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**, which tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule. The formula is:\nDoU = C - (H/2) + 1  (for formulas containing only C, H, and O)\n\nOur molecule has a C=C double bond (1 DoU) and a C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid (1 DoU).\nTherefore, the **required DoU is 1 + 1 = 2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n*   **B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n*   **C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This does not match. A compound with this formula could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid, which has one C=O) but cannot also have a C=C double bond.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly the chemical formula **C6H10O2** is consistent with all the analytical data. It accounts for the two oxygen atoms of a carboxylic acid and has the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to include both a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\n*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this peak to be exceptionally broad, often overlapping with C-H stretching absorptions.\n    *   A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Combined with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   A strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) stretch.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (an alkene functional group).\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺. (Atomic masses: C=12, O=16, H=1. So, 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    *   The evidence from all three techniques points to a molecule that is both a carboxylic acid and an alkene. Such a molecule is called an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O), as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with B (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2). To distinguish between these, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The formula for DoU for a compound CxHyOz is `DoU = x - y/2 + 1`.\n        *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains one C=O double bond, which accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n        *   An alkene group (C=C) contains one C=C double bond, which accounts for **another degree of unsaturation**.\n        *   Therefore, our molecule must have a total DoU of at least 2.\n\n*   **Calculating the Degree of Unsaturation for the remaining options:**\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1. This formula represents a saturated molecule with one double bond or one ring. A saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) fits this formula, but it contradicts the NMR and FTIR data showing a C=C bond.\n    *   **C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2. This DoU of 2 is perfectly consistent with a molecule containing one C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C bond (from the alkene).\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The spectroscopic data collectively identifies an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only formula that fits this description is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\n*   **Analysis of FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of an O-H bond stretch, specifically within a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O) stretch. This value is typical for the C=O in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an alkene (C=C) double bond stretch.\n    *   Putting this together, the FTIR data suggests the presence of both a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for vinyl hydrogens directly confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C). Vinyl hydrogens are the protons attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very common and strong indicator for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n*   **Synthesis of Information and Evaluation of Molecular Formulas:**\n    1.  The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen.\n    2.  We are left with C) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2. To distinguish between them, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE), also known as double bond equivalents. The formula for DBE is: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n    3.  From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the carbonyl (C=O) in the carboxylic acid and one for the alkene (C=C). So, we are looking for a formula with a DBE of 2.\n    4.  Let's calculate the DBE for the remaining options:\n        *   For C) C6H12O2: DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This formula only accounts for one double bond (or a ring), which would fit a saturated carboxylic acid, but not one that also contains an alkene.\n        *   For D) C6H10O2: DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This DBE of 2 perfectly matches our findings: one degree of unsaturation for the C=O bond and one for the C=C bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The combined spectroscopic evidence (carboxylic acid + alkene) requires a molecular formula with two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of 2. Only C6H10O2 fits all the criteria. An example of such a compound would be hexenoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of an O-H stretching vibration. The \"very broad\" nature of this peak is highly characteristic of the hydrogen-bonded O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). While alcohols also have O-H groups, their peaks are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The additional peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ shows the compound also contains an alkene group. Therefore, the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the loss of the alkyl chain, leaving behind the positively charged carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺. The mass is calculated as:\n        *   Carbon: 12\n        *   Oxygen: 16\n        *   Oxygen: 16\n        *   Hydrogen: 1\n        *   Total mass = 45\n    *   This provides strong evidence for the carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Data and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   The evidence overwhelmingly points to a molecule that is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the molecule must contain:\n        1.  A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has **two oxygen atoms**.\n        2.  An alkene group (C=C).\n    *   The presence of two oxygen atoms immediately eliminates options C) C6H10O and D) C6H12O.\n    *   We are left with A) C6H10O2 and B) C6H12O2. The difference is the degree of unsaturation (DoU), which reflects the number of rings and/or pi bonds. The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2).\n        *   **For B) C6H12O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n            A DoU of 1 accounts for the one pi bond in the carbonyl (C=O) of the carboxylic acid. This formula represents a **saturated** carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid). It would not have a C=C bond, contradicting the FTIR and NMR data.\n        *   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n            A DoU of 2 is required to have both a carbonyl pi bond (C=O) and an alkene pi bond (C=C). This formula represents an **unsaturated** carboxylic acid, which is perfectly consistent with all the provided spectral data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound must be an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The molecular formula that matches this structural requirement is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n*   **Analysis of FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, specifically that of a carboxylic acid (which is often around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n    *   The combination of the broad O-H and the C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens (hydrogens attached to a C=C bond) confirms the presence of an alkene functional group in the molecule.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group itself, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass calculation: Carbon (≈12) + Oxygen (≈16) + Oxygen (≈16) + Hydrogen (≈1) = 45.\n\n*   **Combining the Evidence and Evaluating Options:**\n    1.  The evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group is overwhelming. A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen.\n    2.  We are left with two possibilities: B) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2.\n    3.  To distinguish between these two, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each formula and compare it to the unsaturation indicated by the functional groups. The formula for DoU is `C - H/2 + 1` for a compound containing only C, H, and O.\n    4.  From the spectroscopic data, we know there are two sources of unsaturation:\n        *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid).\n        *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene).\n        *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\n    5.  Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   For **B) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1. This formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (or an ester). It does not account for the C=C double bond.\n        *   For **D) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches the presence of one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the molecular formula C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group, specifically one found in a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n    *   Conclusion from FTIR: The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This supports the FTIR data indicating an alkene functional group.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic indicator for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12.01 for C + 16.00 for O + 16.00 for O + 1.01 for H ≈ 45).\n\n*   **Synthesis of Data and Evaluation of Formulas:**\n    *   The combined spectral data strongly indicate that the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid (it contains both -COOH and C=C groups).\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms, which immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O).\n    *   Now we must choose between B (C6H10O2) and D (C6H12O2). We can use the degree of unsaturation (DBE) to distinguish them. The formula for DBE is: DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   The presence of a C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) contributes 1 to the DBE.\n    *   The presence of a C=C double bond (from the alkene) contributes another 1 to the DBE.\n    *   Therefore, the total DBE of the molecule must be at least 2.\n\n*   **DBE Calculation for the remaining options:**\n    *   **For C6H10O2 (B):** DBE = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2. This matches our required DBE.\n    *   **For C6H12O2 (D):** DBE = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1. This would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which does not have a C=C bond and would not show vinyl-hydrogen peaks in the 1H NMR.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The only formula that is consistent with all the provided data (unsaturated carboxylic acid) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
