The core principle is that the maximum measured wavelength shift of a star's spectral line (`Δλ`) is directly proportional to the star's maximum line-of-sight velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude (`K`).\n\n    *   **Relationship:** `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   **Given Data:** We have `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstroms and `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstroms.\n    *   **Ratio:** This allows us to establish the ratio of the stars' velocities:\n        $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity to the Planet's Orbital Period**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude `K` is related to the planet's orbital period `P` by the laws of orbital mechanics. The full formula is `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`. The problem states several conditions that simplify this relationship:\n    *   The stars have the same mass (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   For the problem to be solvable with a unique answer, we must make the standard assumption that the orbital inclinations `i` are also similar, making the term `m_p * sin(i)` effectively constant.\n\n    With all other terms in the equation being constant, the relationship simplifies to a crucial proportionality:\n\n    *   **Relationship:** `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` or `K ∝ 1 / (P^(1/3))`.\n\n3.  **Combine Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`). We can use the proportionality from the previous step to set up an equation:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(P_1)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} $$\n    Using the rules of exponents, this simplifies to:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To solve for the desired period ratio (`P₂ / P₁`), we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    Substitute the known velocity ratio from Step 1 into the final equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n    Rounding this result gives approximately **0.36**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Key Proportionality:** The most critical step is identifying the correct physical relationship `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. This inverse relationship signifies that a higher stellar velocity implies a shorter planetary period.\n*   **The Final Mathematical Operation:** It is crucial to recognize that isolating `P₂ / P₁` requires *cubing* the velocity ratio, not taking its cube root or using a different power. This follows directly from the exponent in the proportionality.\n*   **Handling the Ratios:** The question specifically asks for `P₂ / P₁`. It is essential to keep the indices (1 and 2) consistent throughout the derivation to avoid accidentally calculating the inverse ratio, `P₁ / P₂ = (7/5)³ ≈ 2.74`.\n*   **Implicit Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption in such problems that unknown factors (like orbital inclination `i`) are similar for both systems, allowing the other parameters to be compared directly.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** This is a vital step to validate the result. Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 vs. 5 mÅ), so its host star moves faster (`K₂ > K₁`). For planets of similar mass, a stronger gravitational tug is required, which implies the planet is in a closer orbit. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we must expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, meaning the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. Our result of `~0.36` is consistent with this physical intuition, whereas options greater than 1 would be incorrect.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately **0.36**.

The minor discrepancies in the final letter chosen are due to the agents being presented with differently ordered lists of options, not any error in their reasoning. The following step-by-step process confirms the correct numerical result and highlights important points of consideration.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Relate Observational Data to Stellar Velocity**\nThe problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The core principle of this method is that the measured maximum periodic shift in a star's spectral line wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's maximum line-of-sight velocity, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$).\n\n*   **Relationship:** $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n*   **Data:** We are given $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n*   **Ratio:** The ratio of the stars' velocities is therefore the same as the ratio of their wavelength shifts:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n**2. Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to the Planet's Orbital Period (P)**\nThe formula for a star's velocity semi-amplitude caused by a planet in a circular orbit is:\n$$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\nThe problem states that star masses ($M_{star}$) are identical and planet masses ($m_p$) are similar. For the problem to be solvable, a standard assumption is made that the term representing the detected mass, $m_p \\sin(i)$, is also the same for both systems. With these parameters being constant, the formula simplifies to a crucial proportionality between the star's velocity and the planet's period:\n\n*   **Relationship:** $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\nThis means that a higher stellar velocity is caused by a planet with a shorter orbital period.\n\n**3. Combine Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio ($P_2/P_1$)**\nWe can use the proportionality from the previous step to establish an equation relating the two systems:\n$$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(P_1)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3} $$\nThe question asks for the ratio of the period of planet #2 to planet #1 ($P_2/P_1$). To solve for this, we cube both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 $$\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Value**\nSubstitute the known velocity ratio into the final equation. The code output confirms the calculation:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\nThe numerical result is approximately **0.36**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Core Proportionality:** The most critical step is recognizing the relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$. A mistake in the exponent or the inverse nature of the relationship (i.e., that a larger K implies a smaller P) would lead to an incorrect conclusion.\n2.  **Correct Ratio Direction:** The question asks for $P_2 / P_1$. It is crucial to set up the algebra correctly to solve for this specific ratio, which results in using $(K_1 / K_2)^3$. Accidentally inverting the ratio to $(K_2 / K_1)^3$ would give a result greater than 1, which is physically incorrect in this scenario.\n3.  **Final Mathematical Operation:** The derivation requires *cubing* the velocity ratio to find the period ratio. A common error could be to take the cube root instead.\n4.  **Implicit Assumptions:** The solution depends on the necessary assumption that unstated parameters, specifically the orbital inclination `i`, are similar for both systems. This allows the measured quantity, $m_p \\sin(i)$, to be treated as a constant.\n5.  **Physical Sanity Check:** This is a vital step to verify the result.\n    *   Planet #2 causes a *larger* wavelength shift (7 > 5), so its host star must be moving *faster* ($K_2 > K_1$).\n    *   For similar planet masses, a faster stellar \"wobble\" is caused by a planet in a *closer* orbit.\n    *   By Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a *shorter* period.\n    *   Therefore, we must expect $P_2 < P_1$, which means the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this check, whereas options like 1.40 or 1.96 are not.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation yields a result of ~0.36.

The only difference in the agents' final answers is the letter choice, which is explained by the options being presented in a different random order to each agent. The core reasoning is sound and consistent across all candidates.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to confirm the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift (Observable) to Stellar Velocity (Physical Quantity)**\n    The problem utilizes the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The foundational principle is that the maximum measured wavelength shift of a star's spectral line, `Δλ`, is directly proportional to the star's maximum line-of-sight velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude, `K`.\n    *   **Relationship:** `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   **Given Data:** `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstroms, `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstroms.\n    *   **Ratio:** This direct proportionality allows us to establish the ratio of the stars' velocities:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n    The formula for a star's velocity semi-amplitude `K` caused by a planet in a circular orbit is `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`.

This means a higher stellar velocity implies a shorter orbital period.\n\n3.  **Combine Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, which is `P₂ / P₁`.\n    *   Using the proportionality from Step 2, we can set up the equation:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    *   Using the rules of exponents, this simplifies to:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁/P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂/P₁)^(1/3)`\n    *   To solve for the desired ratio `P₂ / P₁`, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n        `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n    Substitute the known velocity ratio from Step 1 into the final equation:\n    ```python\n    # Calculate the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1.\n    # This is equal to the cube of the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes (K1/K2),\n    # which in turn is equal to the cube of the ratio of the wavelength shifts (5/7).\n    ratio = (5/7)**3\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n    The calculation yields:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5/7)³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Sanity Check:** It is essential to check if the answer makes physical sense. Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 vs. 5), so its host star moves faster (`K₂ > K₁`). For planets of similar mass, a faster stellar \"wobble\" is caused by a planet in a closer orbit. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit corresponds to a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we must expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, which means the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1.

Mistaking this for a different operation (like taking a cube root) is a common potential error.\n*   **Ratio Direction:** The question asks for `P₂ / P₁`. It is crucial to maintain the correct indices throughout the derivation to avoid calculating the inverse ratio, `P₁ / P₂`, which would give `(7/5)³ ≈ 2.74`.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 vs. 5 mÅ), so its host star moves faster (`K₂ > K₁`). For similar-mass planets, a stronger gravitational tug from a planet in a closer orbit causes a faster wobble. By Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit corresponds to a shorter period. Therefore, we should expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, making the ratio `P₂ / P₁` less than 1.

Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to the Planet's Orbital Period (P)**\nThe formula for a star's velocity semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`. The problem provides several simplifying conditions: the stars have the same mass, the planets have similar masses, and it's a standard assumption for solvability that the unseen orbital inclinations (`i`) are also similar. This allows us to treat all terms except `K` and `P` as constant for both systems.\n\n*   **Simplified Principle:** The formula simplifies to the crucial proportionality `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. This means that a star's velocity is inversely proportional to the cube root of its planet's orbital period.\n\n**3. Combine Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`). We can use the proportionality from the previous step:\n$$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} $$\nUsing the laws of exponents, this expression becomes:\n$$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nTo isolate the desired ratio `P₂ / P₁`, we cube both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Value**\nWe substitute the known ratio of velocities from Step 1 into our final equation. The provided code execution confirms the calculation:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 vs. 5), so its host star moves faster (`K₂ > K₁`). For planets of similar mass, a faster stellar \"wobble\" is caused by a planet in a closer orbit. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, meaning the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. Our result of `~0.36` is consistent with this physical reasoning, which immediately eliminates options like 1.96 and 1.40.\n*   **Mathematical Operations:** It is critical to recognize that solving for the period ratio requires cubing the velocity ratio, not taking the cube root or any other operation.\n*   **Final Answer Selection:** The universally calculated numerical value is approximately **0.36**. We now match this to the specific list of options provided in the original question:\n\n    A) ~ 1.96\n    B) ~ 0.36\n    C) ~ 0.85\n    D) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value of `~0.36` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers from other agents, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the correct physical principles and mathematical derivation required to solve the problem. The discrepancy in the final letter choices among the agents stems from the fact that the multiple-choice options were presented to them in different random orders.\n\nThe following is a definitive step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Observational Data to Stellar Velocity:** The problem is based on the Radial Velocity (RV) method, which uses the Doppler effect. The maximum observed shift in a star's spectral line wavelength, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's maximum line-of-sight velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude, $K$.\n    *   **Physical Principle:** $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n    *   **Given Data:** For planet #1, $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms. For planet #2, $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n    *   **Ratio:** This proportionality allows us to find the ratio of the stars' velocities:\n        $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity to Planet's Orbital Period:** The formula for the star's velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) induced by a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\n    The problem provides simplifying conditions: the stars have identical masses ($M_{\\text{star}}$ is constant) and the planets have similar masses ($m_p$ is constant). For the problem to be solvable, it is a necessary and standard assumption that the orbital inclination ($i$) is also similar for both systems, meaning $\\sin(i)$ is constant.\n    *   **Physical Principle:** With all other terms in the equation being constant, the relationship simplifies to an inverse proportionality between the star's velocity and the cube root of the planet's orbital period ($P$):\n        $$ K \\propto P^{-1/3} $$\n\n3.  **Combine Ratios and Solve:** The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 ($\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$). We use the proportionality from the previous step:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(P_1)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To isolate the desired period ratio, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:** We substitute the known ratio of velocities from Step 1 into our final formula.\n    ```python\n    # Calculate the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1\n    period_ratio = (5/7)**3\n    print(period_ratio)\n    ```\n    The calculation yields:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n    This rounds to approximately 0.36.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Underlying Assumptions:** The solution requires the standard assumption that unstated parameters, particularly the orbital inclination ($i$), are similar for both systems. This allows for a direct comparison based on the given data.\n*   **Correct Proportionality:** The core of the problem is recognizing the relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$. A larger stellar velocity ($K$) corresponds to a shorter orbital period ($P$).\n*   **Mathematical Operation:** The final step involves **cubing** the velocity ratio, not taking the cube root or any other power. This follows directly from the exponent in the proportionality.\n*   **Ratio Direction:** The question asks for $P_2/P_1$. Care must be taken to set up the ratios correctly to avoid calculating the inverse, $(7/5)^3 \\approx 1.96$, which corresponds to option B but is physically incorrect.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 > 5), so star #2 moves faster ($K_2 > K_1$). For planets of the same mass, a faster wobble is caused by a planet in a closer orbit. By Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we must expect $P_2 < P_1$, which means the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1.

We use the proportionality from the previous step to set up an equation:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(P_1)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} $$\n    Using the rules of exponents, this becomes:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To solve for the desired period ratio, $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n    Substitute the known velocity ratio from Step 1 into the equation derived in Step 3:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n    Rounding to two decimal places, the result is **0.36**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Key Proportionality:** The most critical step is understanding that stellar velocity `K` is proportional to `P^(-1/3)`. This inverse relationship dictates that a larger velocity implies a shorter period.\n*   **The Final Calculation Step:** The derivation shows that the period ratio is the *cube* of the velocity ratio. A common mistake could be taking a cube root or using an incorrect power.\n*   **Correct Ratio Direction:** The question specifically asks for `P₂ / P₁`.

For the problem to be solvable, a standard assumption is made that the term representing the detected mass, $m_p \\sin(i)$, is also the same for both systems. With these parameters being constant, the formula simplifies to a crucial proportionality between the star's velocity and the planet's period:\n\n*   **Relationship:** $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\nThis means that a higher stellar velocity is caused by a planet with a shorter orbital period.\n\n**3.

A mistake in the exponent or the inverse nature of the relationship (i.e., that a larger K implies a smaller P) would lead to an incorrect conclusion.\n2.  **Correct Ratio Direction:** The question asks for $P_2 / P_1$. It is crucial to set up the algebra correctly to solve for this specific ratio, which results in using $(K_1 / K_2)^3$. Accidentally inverting the ratio to $(K_2 / K_1)^3$ would give a result greater than 1, which is physically incorrect in this scenario.\n3.  **Final Mathematical Operation:** The derivation requires *cubing* the velocity ratio to find the period ratio. A common error could be to take the cube root instead.\n4.  **Implicit Assumptions:** The solution depends on the necessary assumption that unstated parameters, specifically the orbital inclination `i`, are similar for both systems. This allows the measured quantity, $m_p \\sin(i)$, to be treated as a constant.\n5.  **Physical Sanity Check:** This is a vital step to verify the result.\n    *   Planet #2 causes a *larger* wavelength shift (7 > 5), so its host star must be moving *faster* ($K_2 > K_1$).\n    *   For similar planet masses, a faster stellar \"wobble\" is caused by a planet in a *closer* orbit.\n    *   By Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a *shorter* period.\n    *   Therefore, we must expect $P_2 < P_1$, which means the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1.

This means a higher stellar velocity implies a shorter orbital period.\n\n3.  **Combine Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, which is `P₂ / P₁`.\n    *   Using the proportionality from Step 2, we can set up the equation:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    *   Using the rules of exponents, this simplifies to:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁/P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂/P₁)^(1/3)`\n    *   To solve for the desired ratio `P₂ / P₁`, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n        `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n    Substitute the known velocity ratio from Step 1 into the final equation:\n    ```python\n    # Calculate the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1.\n    # This is equal to the cube of the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes (K1/K2),\n    # which in turn is equal to the cube of the ratio of the wavelength shifts (5/7).\n    ratio = (5/7)**3\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n    The calculation yields:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5/7)³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Sanity Check:** It is essential to check if the answer makes physical sense. Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 vs. 5), so its host star moves faster (`K₂ > K₁`). For planets of similar mass, a faster stellar \"wobble\" is caused by a planet in a closer orbit. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit corresponds to a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we must expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, which means the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1.

The maximum observed shift corresponds to the star's velocity semi-amplitude (`K`).\n    *   **Relationship:** `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   **Given Data:** `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstroms and `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstroms.\n    *   **Ratio:** This direct proportionality allows us to establish a ratio of the stellar velocities: `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to the Planet's Orbital Period (P)**\n    The formula for a star's velocity semi-amplitude, caused by a planet in a circular orbit, is `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`. The problem states several conditions that simplify this relationship:\n    *   The stars have the same mass (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   For the problem to be solvable, a standard assumption is that the unseen orbital inclination (`i`) is also similar, making the term `m_p * sin(i)` effectively constant.\n    *   **Key Proportionality:** With these terms being constant, the formula simplifies to `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. This means the star's velocity is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's orbital period.\n\n3.  **Combine the Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`). Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n    *   `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    *   This can be rearranged using exponent rules: `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`.\n    *   To solve for the desired period ratio, `P₂ / P₁`, we must cube both sides of the equation: `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n    Substitute the known ratio of velocities into the final formula:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Key Proportionality:** The most critical step is recognizing the relationship `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. This inverse relationship is fundamental; a larger stellar velocity (`K`) implies a shorter planetary period (`P`).\n*   **The Final Mathematical Step:** The derivation logically leads to cubing the velocity ratio to find the period ratio. A common mistake would be to take the cube root or use a different power.\n*   **Handling Ratios:** It is crucial to keep the indices (1 and 2) consistent throughout the calculation. The question asks for `P₂ / P₁`, which correctly corresponds to `(K₁ / K₂)^3`. Inverting the ratio would yield an incorrect answer of `(7/5)³ ≈ 2.74`.\n*   **Sanity Check:** A physical check confirms the result. Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 > 5), so its star moves faster (`K₂ > K₁`). For similar planet and star masses, a faster stellar \"wobble\" is caused by a planet in a closer orbit. By Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit corresponds to a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, meaning the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1.

Taking the cube root or using any other power would be incorrect.\n*   **Correct Ratio Direction:** The question asks for the period of planet #2 relative to planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`). The derivation must be set up carefully to solve for this specific ratio (`P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`) and not its inverse.\n*   **Implicit Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption that unknown parameters, such as the orbital inclination `i`, are similar for both systems. This is necessary to create a solvable problem from the given information.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** This is a vital step to ensure the answer makes sense.\n    *   Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (`Δλ₂ > Δλ₁`), which means star #2 moves faster (`K₂ > K₁`).\n    *   For a planet of similar mass, a faster star implies a stronger gravitational tug from a planet in a closer orbit.\n    *   According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit means a shorter period (`P₂ < P₁`).\n    *   Therefore, the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1.

For the problem to be solvable, it is a necessary and standard assumption that the orbital inclination ($i$) is also similar for both systems, meaning $\\sin(i)$ is constant.\n    *   **Physical Principle:** With all other terms in the equation being constant, the relationship simplifies to an inverse proportionality between the star's velocity and the cube root of the planet's orbital period ($P$):\n        $$ K \\propto P^{-1/3} $$\n\n3.  **Combine Ratios and Solve:** The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 ($\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$). We use the proportionality from the previous step:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(P_1)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To isolate the desired period ratio, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:** We substitute the known ratio of velocities from Step 1 into our final formula.\n    ```python\n    # Calculate the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1\n    period_ratio = (5/7)**3\n    print(period_ratio)\n    ```\n    The calculation yields:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n    This rounds to approximately 0.36.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Underlying Assumptions:** The solution requires the standard assumption that unstated parameters, particularly the orbital inclination ($i$), are similar for both systems. This allows for a direct comparison based on the given data.\n*   **Correct Proportionality:** The core of the problem is recognizing the relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$. A larger stellar velocity ($K$) corresponds to a shorter orbital period ($P$).\n*   **Mathematical Operation:** The final step involves **cubing** the velocity ratio, not taking the cube root or any other power. This follows directly from the exponent in the proportionality.\n*   **Ratio Direction:** The question asks for $P_2/P_1$. Care must be taken to set up the ratios correctly to avoid calculating the inverse, $(7/5)^3 \\approx 1.96$, which corresponds to option B but is physically incorrect.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 > 5), so star #2 moves faster ($K_2 > K_1$). For planets of the same mass, a faster wobble is caused by a planet in a closer orbit. By Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we must expect $P_2 < P_1$, which means the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this physical intuition.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately 0.36.

The maximum observed shift in a spectral line's wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity along the line of sight ($K$).\n\n    *   **Physical Principle:** $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n    *   **Given Data:** We have $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms for planet #1 and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms for planet #2.\n    *   **Derived Ratio:** This proportionality allows us to establish the ratio of the stellar velocities:\n        $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Planet's Orbital Period (P)**\n    The formula for a star's velocity semi-amplitude caused by a planet in a circular orbit is derived from the conservation of momentum and Kepler's Third Law:\n    $$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\n    The problem provides crucial information that simplifies this relationship:\n    *   The stars have the same mass ($M_{\\text{star1}} = M_{\\text{star2}}$).\n    *   The planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$).\n    *   For the problem to be solvable with a unique answer, it is a standard and necessary assumption that the orbital inclination angle ($i$) is also similar for both systems.\n\n    With these parameters being effectively constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a key proportionality:\n    *   **Simplified Principle:** $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$. This means that the star's velocity is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's period.\n\n3.  **Combine the Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 ($\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$). We use the proportionality from the previous step to set up an equation:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(P_1)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} $$\n    Using the rules of exponents, this becomes:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To solve for the desired period ratio, $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n    Substitute the known velocity ratio from Step 1 into the equation derived in Step 3:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n    Rounding to two decimal places, the result is **0.36**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Key Proportionality:** The most critical step is understanding that stellar velocity `K` is proportional to `P^(-1/3)`. This inverse relationship dictates that a larger velocity implies a shorter period.\n*   **The Final Calculation Step:** The derivation shows that the period ratio is the *cube* of the velocity ratio. A common mistake could be taking a cube root or using an incorrect power.\n*   **Correct Ratio Direction:** The question specifically asks for `P₂ / P₁`. Setting up the algebra carefully to solve for this and not its inverse (`P₁ / P₂`) is crucial. The final expression must be `(K₁ / K₂)^3`.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** This is a vital step to ensure the answer makes physical sense.\n    1.  Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 > 5), which means its host star is moving faster (`K₂ > K₁`).\n    2.  For similar-mass planets, a faster stellar \"wobble\" is caused by a stronger gravitational tug from a planet in a closer orbit.\n    3.  According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter orbital period.\n    4.  Therefore, we must expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, meaning the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. Our calculated result of ~0.36 is consistent with this check. Options like 1.40 or 1.96 would be physically incorrect.\n*   **Implicit Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption in such problems that unknown factors (like orbital inclination `i`) are similar for both systems, allowing the other parameters to be compared directly.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe step-by-step analysis and sanity check consistently show that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Matching this numerical value to the list of options provided in the question:\n\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 0.85\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.36 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a complete and unanimous consensus on the correct physical principles, the necessary mathematical derivations, and the final numerical result. The variations in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are explicitly noted by the candidates to be a result of them receiving the multiple-choice options in a randomized order, not a disagreement on the correct answer. The following analysis validates the unanimous reasoning and matches the result to the specific option list provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Relate the Observable Data (Wavelength Shift) to the Star's Velocity**\n\nThe problem relies on the Radial Velocity (RV) method, which uses the Doppler effect. The maximum observed shift in a spectral line's wavelength, `Δλ`, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity along the line of sight, `K`.\n\n*   **Physical Principle:** `K ∝ Δλ`\n*   **Given Data:**\n    *   `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstroms\n    *   `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstroms\n*   **Derived Ratio:** From the direct proportionality, the ratio of the stars' velocities is equal to the ratio of their observed wavelength shifts:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Star's Velocity (K) to the Planet's Orbital Period (P)**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the star's velocity semi-amplitude is derived from Kepler's Laws of planetary motion:\n\n`K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`\n\nThe problem states that star masses (`M_star`) are the same and planet masses (`m_p`) are similar. For the problem to be solvable with a unique answer, it's a standard and necessary assumption that the unseen orbital inclinations (`i`) are also similar. This means the entire term `(m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))` can be treated as a constant for both systems.\n\n*   **Simplified Principle:** The formula simplifies to a crucial proportionality between the star's velocity `K` and the planet's orbital period `P`:\n    `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` or `K ∝ 1 / ³√P`\n\n**Step 3: Combine Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`). We can use the proportionality from Step 2 to set up an equation.\n\n*   **Derivation:**\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₁/P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂/P₁)^(1/3)`\n*   To solve for the desired period ratio, we must isolate `P₂ / P₁` by cubing both sides of the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n\nSubstitute the velocity ratio from Step 1 into the final equation. The provided code output confirms this calculation.\n\n*   **Calculation:** `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³ ≈ 0.3644`\n*   This result rounds to **~0.36**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Key Proportionality:** The most critical step is recognizing that the stellar velocity amplitude `K` is proportional to the inverse cube root of the orbital period `P` (`K ∝ P^(-1/3)`). Any other relationship would yield a wrong answer.\n*   **The Final Operation:** It is essential to cube the velocity ratio to find the period ratio (`P ∝ K⁻³`). A common mistake would be to take the cube root or use a simple linear relationship.\n*   **Handling Ratios:** The question asks for `P₂ / P₁`. It is crucial to maintain the correct order of indices (1 and 2) throughout the derivation to avoid accidentally calculating the inverse ratio, `P₁ / P₂ ≈ 2.74`.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Star #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (`7 > 5`), which means it moves faster (`K₂ > K₁`). For planets of similar mass, a faster \"wobble\" is caused by a stronger gravitational tug from a closer planet. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we should expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, meaning the ratio `P₂/P₁` must be less than 1. Our result of `~0.36` is consistent with this physical intuition.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe unanimously agreed-upon numerical result is `~0.36`. We must match this to the authoritative list of options provided in the question:\n\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 0.36\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value of `~0.36` corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
