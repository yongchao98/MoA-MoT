Identification of Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**\n*   **The Clue:** Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Analysis:** First, convert the temperature to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C. This value is nearly identical to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C, and significantly different from that of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C.\n*   **Conclusion:** Substance B is confidently identified as D₂O. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" central to the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This initial identification is the critical lynchpin for solving the rest of the problem.\n\n**2. Identification of Gas W**\n*   **The Clue:** The molecule of gas W contains an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   **Analysis:** In a chemical system now known to contain Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the most logical gaseous product is di-deuterium gas (D₂). A molecule of D₂ consists of two deuterium atoms, for a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂.\n\n**3. Identification of Substance X**\n*   **The Clues:**\n    1.  Substance X's \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\".\n    2.  This reagent reacts with a \"keto acid\" to yield a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n*   **Analysis:** A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., in a ketone group >C=O and a carboxylic acid group -COOH). For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol group (-COOH → -CH₂OH). This specific transformation requires a very powerful reducing agent. The canonical reagent for this task is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Milder reagents are not strong enough.\n*   **Conclusion:** The \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains the heavy isotope Deuterium, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Knowledge of the relative strengths of common organic reducing agents (LiAlH₄ vs. NaBH₄) is essential here.\n\n**4. Verification of the Entire Reaction**\n*   The proposed identities must fit the complete reaction description: `LiAlD₄ (X) + Y → G + W`.\n*   Since the products are deuterated, the liquid reactant Y must be D₂O. The full reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n*   This reaction is consistent with all clues: it is known to be violent, it releases D₂ gas (W), and it forms an insoluble precipitate G (Aluminium deuteroxide), which upon heating would decompose and release D₂O (B).\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present:** The elements are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (identified by the lowest atomic number).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium (identified by the highest atomic number).\n*   **Calculation:** The task requires summing the integer mass numbers of *all* atoms of these two elements, using their specific isotopes.\n    *   Mass contribution from the **heaviest element** (Aluminium): There is one atom of Aluminium. Its stable isotope is ²⁷Al, so its mass number is **27**.\n    *   Mass contribution from the **lightest element** (Hydrogen): There are four atoms, all present as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is **2**. The total mass is `4 × 2 = 8`.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** `27 + 8 = 35`.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35. Comparing this to the original options provided:\nA) 25\nB) 35\nC) 31\nD) 29\n\nThe calculated result of 35 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and the problem statement, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the step-by-step reasoning required to solve the question. The logic is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heavier Isotope and Substance B**\n*   **Clue:** Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Analysis:** Converting the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius (`277 K - 273.15 K`) gives 3.85 °C. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C, which is significantly different from the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O).\n*   **Conclusion:** This identifies Substance B as **D₂O** and establishes the \"heavier isotope\" as **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly identify the melting point of D₂O as being anomalously higher than H₂O, a well-known chemical fact.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\n*   **Clue:** The molecule of gas W contains \"the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n*   **Analysis:** A Deuterium atom contains 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a molecule of Deuterium gas (D₂) contains a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly satisfying the condition.\n*   **Conclusion:** Gas W is **D₂**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X**\n*   **Clues:** X's \"very close analog\" is a common organic reagent that reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with 2 oxygen atoms.\n*   **Analysis:** A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., one from a ketone group >C=O, and two from a carboxylic acid group -COOH). For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol group (-COOH → -CH₂OH), which removes one oxygen atom. This is a powerful reduction.\n*   **Conclusion:** The standard reagent for this strong reduction is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (**LiAlH₄**). Milder reagents like NaBH₄ are not capable of this. Since Substance X contains Deuterium, it must be the deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Differentiating the reactivity of powerful reducing agents (like LiAlH₄) from milder ones (like NaBH₄) is key to identifying the analog.\n\n**Step 4: Final Calculation**\n*   **Task:** Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Elements Present:** Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (present as Deuterium).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium.\n*   **Calculation:** The question asks for a cumulative sum, meaning we must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using their specific isotopic mass numbers.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is **one** atom of the stable isotope of Aluminium (²⁷Al). Its mass number is **27**.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are **four** atoms of Hydrogen, present as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). Its mass number is **2**. The total mass is `4 × 2 = 8`.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** `27 + 8 = 35`.\n*   **Careful Point:** Ensure you sum the mass for *all* atoms of the relevant elements (four Deuterium atoms, not one) and use the correct mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved (²H, not ¹H).\n\nThe calculated result is 35. This matches option C in the list provided in the question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers, a clear and consistent logical path emerges to solve the problem. All candidates correctly identified the core chemical principles and reached the same numerical conclusion, with discrepancies only arising from the random ordering of the multiple-choice options they were presented with.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis incorporating the necessary careful points:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heavier Isotope and Substance B**\nThe initial and most important clue is the melting point of substance B, given as \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Careful Point 1: Temperature Conversion.** The temperature must be converted from Kelvin to Celsius to be easily compared with common substances: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Isotopic Effects on Physical Properties.** The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C, while the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. The given value is a near-perfect match for heavy water.\n*   **Conclusion:** This step definitively identifies Substance B as D₂O and establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\nThe gas W released has molecules that \"contain the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n*   **Careful Point 3: Contextual Application.** This clue must be interpreted within the context that the system contains Deuterium. A single Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   **Conclusion:** The only logical gaseous molecule that can form is di-deuterium gas, **D₂**. A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly satisfying the condition.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X**\nThe identity of X is revealed through several organic chemistry clues.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Analyzing the Organic Reaction.** A \"keto acid\" has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group and two in the carboxylic acid group). The reaction product has only 2 oxygens. This means a single oxygen atom was removed. This happens when a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol group (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Careful Point 5: Differentiating Reagent Strengths.** This specific reduction is a powerful one. A common reagent like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is not strong enough. The canonical reagent for this transformation is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). This must be the \"very close analog\".\n*   **Conclusion:** Since Substance X contains Deuterium, it must be the deuterated version: **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Entire Reaction Sequence**\nThe reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`. This is consistent with all clues: the reaction is famously violent, it produces a precipitate (G, Aluminium Deuteroxide), and heating G releases B (D₂O).\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   **Careful Point 6: Identifying Lightest/Heaviest Elements.** This is determined by atomic number (Z). In LiAlD₄, the elements are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13). Therefore, the lightest is Hydrogen and the heaviest is Aluminium.\n*   **Careful Point 7: Summing all Relevant Atoms.** The term \"cumulative\" means we must sum the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements. This includes all four Deuterium atoms.\n*   **Careful Point 8: Using Isotopic Masses.** Since the answer choices are integers and the problem specifies an isotope, the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes must be used, not the average atomic masses from the periodic table.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is one atom of ²⁷Al. Mass = **27**.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium): There are four atoms of ²H. Total mass = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**.\n\nThe calculation yields a final answer of 35. This matches option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong and unanimous consensus on the chemical reasoning and the final calculated value. The discrepancies in the letter choices among the candidates are due to the shuffling of the options, but the core logic remains identical and sound. Here is a definitive step-by-step analysis incorporating the critical points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**\n*   The first critical clue is the melting point of substance B, \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Careful Point:** It is essential to convert this temperature to Celsius to compare it with known melting points: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C. This value is a nearly perfect match for the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is 3.82 °C. This is distinctly different from normal water (H₂O) which melts at 0 °C.\n*   **Conclusion:** This identifies Substance B as D₂O and, crucially, establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" is **Deuterium (D, or ²H)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\n*   The gas W, released during the reaction, has molecules with \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n*   **Careful Point:** This clue must be interpreted within the established context that the system contains Deuterium. A Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a diatomic molecule of Deuterium gas (**D₂**) will contain 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X**\n*   This step requires synthesizing multiple clues, particularly from organic chemistry. X (or its \"very close analog\") reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n*   **Careful Point:** A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (in the ketone `>C=O` and carboxylic acid `-COOH` groups). For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-COOH → -CH₂OH`), a reaction that removes one oxygen atom. This is a difficult transformation that requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n*   **Conclusion:** The famous reagent capable of this is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Since Substance X contains the isotope Deuterium, **Substance X must be the deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Entire Reaction**\n*   **Careful Point:** Good practice dictates confirming that all identified substances fit the overall reaction narrative: `X reacts violently with liquid Y ... with the release of a gas W ... and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B`.\n*   The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑` is consistent with all clues: it is violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms an insoluble precipitate G (Aluminium deuteroxide), which upon heating correctly releases B (D₂O). The chemical puzzle is internally consistent.\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Final Calculation**\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Identify the elements first by atomic number: Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13). The lightest is Hydrogen, and the heaviest is Aluminium. Lithium is not part of the calculation.\n*   **Careful Point:** The term \"cumulative\" means summing the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements. The molecule has four atoms of Hydrogen and one atom of Aluminium.\n*   **Careful Point:** Use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved in LiAlD₄, as implied by the integer answer choices. These are ²H (Deuterium, mass = 2) and ²⁷Al (Aluminium, mass = 27).\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass from heaviest element (Aluminium): 1 atom × 27 = 27\n    *   Mass from lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium): 4 atoms × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**\n\nThe calculated result is 35. This must be matched with the options provided in the original question:\nA) 29\nB) 31\nC) 35\nD) 25\n\nThe value 35 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the step-by-step reasoning required to solve this problem. The final numerical answer is consistent across all analyses. Here is a breakdown of the logical path, highlighting the careful points required for a correct solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**\n    *   The first concrete clue is that Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** It is crucial to correctly convert this temperature and compare it to known values. 277 K is equal to 3.85 °C (277 - 273.15). This value is an almost perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C, and is significantly different from normal water's (H₂O) melting point of 0 °C.\n    *   This establishes that **Substance B is D₂O**, and therefore the \"heavier isotope\" central to the problem is **Deuterium (D, or ²H)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W**\n    *   Gas W's molecules are described as containing an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** This must be interpreted in the context of the newly identified isotope, Deuterium, which contains 1 proton and 1 neutron. A molecule of Deuterium gas (**D₂**) consists of two such atoms, for a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly fitting the description. Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X**\n    *   This step relies on interpreting the organic chemistry clues correctly. A \"keto acid\" has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group and two in the carboxylic acid group). The reaction with X's \"analog\" results in a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** This requires a powerful reduction of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), which removes one oxygen atom. This specific transformation is a hallmark of the powerful reducing agent **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)** and cannot be achieved by milder reagents.\n    *   Since X is the deuterated analog, we can confidently identify **Substance X as Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Entire Reaction Sequence**\n    *   The proposed identities must fit the full reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    *   This reaction is famously violent, it releases D₂ gas (W), and it forms a precipitate, Aluminium Deuteroxide (G). Heating this precipitate would correctly release D₂O (B). All clues align perfectly.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\" (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Careful Point 4:** The lightest element is determined by atomic number (Z), which is Hydrogen (Z=1), and the heaviest is Aluminium (Z=13).\n    *   **Careful Point 5:** The calculation must sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two types, using the mass numbers for their specific isotopes.\n        *   **Heaviest (Aluminium):** There is one atom of ²⁷Al. Mass = **27**.\n        *   **Lightest (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms, all of which are the isotope Deuterium (²H), which has a mass number of 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**.\n\nMatching the calculated value of 35 to the options provided:\nA) 25\nB) 29\nC) 35\nD) 31\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals an exceptionally strong and unanimous consensus on the core reasoning and the final numerical calculation. The differences in the final letter choices are merely an artifact of shuffled multiple-choice options for each agent. The definitive solution can be synthesized by following a clear, logical path, paying attention to several key details.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the \"Heavier Isotope\"**\n    *   **Clue:** Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   **Careful Point:** The first step is to accurately convert this temperature. 277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C (277 K - 273.15 K). This is a crucial data point.\n    *   **Analysis:** This value is an almost perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C, and distinctly different from normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substance B is definitively identified as D₂O. This establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" central to the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W**\n    *   **Clue:** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This must be interpreted in the context of the already-identified Deuterium isotope (1 proton, 1 neutron).\n    *   **Analysis:** The most logical candidate for a gas in this system is di-deuterium, D₂. A D₂ molecule contains two deuterium atoms, resulting in a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Gas W is **D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X**\n    *   **Clue:** X, or its \"very close analog,\" reduces a keto acid to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A deep understanding of the organic reaction is necessary. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., from one ketone group >C=O and one carboxylic acid group -COOH). To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH). This is a powerful reduction.\n    *   **Analysis:** This specific transformation is characteristic of a strong reducing agent. **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)** is the standard laboratory reagent for this, as weaker reagents (like NaBH₄) are insufficient.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The analog is LiAlH₄. Therefore, Substance X, which contains deuterium, must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Entire Reaction**\n    *   **Clues:** `X reacts violently with liquid Y → gas W + precipitate G`, and `G → B` upon heating.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The entire proposed scheme must be chemically consistent.\n    *   **Analysis:** The reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`. This is known to be a violent reaction, it correctly identifies Y as D₂O, produces W (D₂), and forms a precipitate G (insoluble Aluminium Deuteroxide). Heating G (`2Al(OD)₃`) would decompose it to release B (D₂O). The chemical puzzle fits together perfectly.\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n    *   **Question:** Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Careful Point:** Identify the elements based on atomic number (Z): Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13). Therefore, the lightest is Hydrogen and the heaviest is Aluminium. The term \"cumulative\" requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two types. Integer answer choices imply using integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is one atom of ²⁷Al. Mass = **27**.\n        *   Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen, as Deuterium): There are four atoms of ²H. Total mass = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n        *   **Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe rigorous chemical analysis unanimously leads to a calculated value of 35. Matching this result with the provided options:\nA) 31\nB) 35\nC) 29\nD) 25\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers reveals a unanimous and correct line of reasoning to solve this multi-step chemical problem. The final numerical answer is consistent across all analyses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances and the Isotope**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Interpreting the Melting Point.** The first clue is the melting point of substance B, \"very close to 277 K.\" Converting this to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 K) gives 3.85 °C. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)** at 3.82 °C, and is significantly different from normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C. This identifies substance B as D₂O and reveals the \"heavier isotope\" to be **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Deducing the Gas.** The gas W's molecules have an equal number of protons and neutrons. Within a chemical system now known to contain Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the only logical gas is **di-deuterium (D₂)**, as a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Recognizing the Organic Reaction.** Identifying substance X requires specific knowledge of organic chemistry. X's \"very close analog\" reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., from >C=O and -COOH groups). To lose an oxygen atom, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) must be reduced to a primary alcohol group (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Reagent Specificity.** This powerful reduction is a characteristic reaction of **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)** and cannot be achieved by milder reagents. Therefore, the analog is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains Deuterium, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verification of the Overall Process**\n\nThe entire sequence of events confirms these identifications. The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑` is famously violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate (G, Aluminium Deuteroxide) that, upon heating, would release D₂O (B). All clues are consistent.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Identifying the Correct Elements.** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest** and **heaviest** elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄). The elements present are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13). Based on atomic number (Z), Hydrogen is the lightest and Aluminium is the heaviest.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Summing the Isotopic Masses.** The calculation requires summing the integer mass numbers for all atoms of the relevant elements, using their specific isotopes found in the molecule.\n    *   Heaviest element (Aluminium): There is one atom of ²⁷Al. Mass contribution = **27**.\n    *   Lightest element (Hydrogen): There are four atoms of the isotope Deuterium (²H). Mass contribution = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n*   **Final Sum:** 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\nThe calculated value is 35. Comparing this result with the options provided in the problem description:\nA) 25\nB) 29\nC) 35\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning found in the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points for a correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B and the \"Heavier Isotope\"**\n\nThis is the critical first step that unlocks the entire problem.\n*   **The Clue:** Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Analysis:** We must convert the temperature to the more familiar Celsius scale: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   **Identification:** This temperature is distinctly different from the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O) but is a near-perfect match for the 3.82 °C melting point of heavy water (D₂O).\n*   **Conclusion:** This confidently identifies **Substance B as D₂O**. It also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" central to the problem is **Deuterium (D, or ²H)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Failing to recognize the significance of the 277 K melting point as referring to D₂O would make the rest of the problem impossible to solve correctly.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\n\n*   **The Clue:** The molecule of Gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n*   **Analysis:** This clue must be interpreted within the context established in Step 1—that the system involves Deuterium. A single Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a molecule of Deuterium gas (**D₂**) consists of two such atoms, for a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂, as the number of protons and neutrons are equal (2 of each).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X using all available clues**\n\n*   **The Clue:** The most important clue is that Substance X, or its \"very close analog,\" reduces a \"certain keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n*   **Analysis:** A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group, >C=O, and two in the carboxylic acid group, -COOH). To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH). This is a powerful reduction that not all reducing agents can perform.\n*   **Identification of the Reagent:** This specific reaction is characteristic of the powerful reducing agent **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Milder, more common reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot reduce carboxylic acids. Thus, the \"analog\" is LiAlH₄.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since Substance X contains the Deuterium isotope, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Specific knowledge of the reactivity of common organic reagents is required here. Mistaking the reagent for something weaker would lead to an incorrect identification of X.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Entire Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** `X (LiAlD₄) + Y (liquid) → G (precipitate) + W (D₂)`\n*   **Verification:** For all the products to be deuterated, the liquid Y must also be deuterated, making it **D₂O**. The full reaction `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → Al(OD)₃ + LiOD + 4D₂` is consistent with all clues. It is famously violent, produces D₂ gas, and forms an insoluble precipitate of Aluminium Deuteroxide (`Al(OD)₃`), which when heated releases D₂O. The logical chain is complete and sound.\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Final Calculation**\n\n*   **The Task:** Calculate the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present:** Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13). The lightest is Hydrogen, and the heaviest is Aluminium.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Identify the **heaviest element**: Aluminium (Al). There is **one** atom of Al in the formula. Its stable isotope is ²⁷Al, so its mass number is **27**.\n    2.  Identify the **lightest element**: Hydrogen (H). It is present as the isotope Deuterium (²H). There are **four** atoms of D in the formula. Its mass number is **2**.\n    3.  Sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements: (Mass of Al) + (Total mass of D) = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n*   **Careful Point:** The question requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements. It is also crucial to use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved (²H and ²⁷Al), not the average atomic masses from the periodic table.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35. This corresponds to option D in the provided list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on the unanimous and correct reasoning presented across all candidate answers, the solution can be finalized through a careful, step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**\n*   **Clue:** Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Analysis:** Converting the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C, and significantly different from the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O).\n*   **Conclusion:** This confidently identifies Substance B as D₂O. Consequently, the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D, or ²H).\n*   **Careful Point:** This initial deduction is the cornerstone of the entire solution. Correctly identifying D₂O from its melting point is the critical first step.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\n*   **Clue:** The molecule of gas W contains \"the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n*   **Analysis:** A single Deuterium atom (identified in Step 1) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a diatomic gas molecule of Deuterium (D₂) would contain 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is the only logical candidate that can be formed from the established reactants.\n*   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is important to consider the chemical context. While other molecules might have an equal number of protons and neutrons (e.g., Helium-4), only D₂ can be formed in this specific reaction system.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X**\n*   **Clue:** The \"very close analog\" of Substance X is a common organic reagent that reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n*   **Analysis:** A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group and two in the carboxylic acid group). For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), which removes one oxygen atom. This transformation requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n*   **Conclusion:** The canonical reagent capable of this reduction is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Since Substance X contains the Deuterium isotope, it must be the deuterated version, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Differentiating between the strength of reducing agents is crucial. A milder agent like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot reduce carboxylic acids, so knowing this detail is key to identifying LiAlH₄ as the analog.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Complete Reaction Sequence**\n*   **Clue:** X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W, and forming a precipitate G, which upon heating releases B.\n*   **Analysis:** The full reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑` is consistent with all clues. The reaction is famously violent; liquid Y must be D₂O to supply the deuterium for the products; it forms an insoluble precipitate G (Aluminium deuteroxide); and heating this precipitate would decompose it and release B (D₂O). All parts fit perfectly.\n\n### Final Calculation\nThe final task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Identify Elements:** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13). The lightest is Hydrogen, and the heaviest is Aluminium.\n*   **Sum Masses:** The question asks for a cumulative sum, using the specific isotopic masses.\n    *   **Mass of Heaviest Element (Aluminium):** There is one atom of ²⁷Al. Mass = **27**.\n    *   **Mass of Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms, present as the isotope Deuterium (²H). Mass = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis consistently and robustly leads to a final calculated value of 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is a unanimous and correct consensus on the chemical reasoning and the final calculated value. The discrepancies in the letter choices among the agents are due to the shuffling of the multiple-choice options, but the core logic is identical and sound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identification of the Key Isotope and Substances**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The clue is the melting point of substance B, \"very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   **Careful Point**: It is crucial to correctly convert the Kelvin temperature to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C) and compare it to known melting points. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C, and not normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C. This single clue establishes that Substance B is D₂O and the \"heavier isotope\" is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n*   **Gas W**: The gas molecule W has an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This clue must be interpreted within the established context that the system contains Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron). The most logical gaseous molecule is **D₂**, which contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly fitting the description.\n*   **Substance X and its Analog**: X's \"very close analog\" is an organic reagent that reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one from the ketone group and two from the carboxylic acid group). The reaction removes one oxygen atom.\n    *   **Careful Point**: It is essential to recognize the chemical transformation being described: the reduction of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). This requires a powerful reducing agent. The well-known reagent for this is **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Milder agents are not strong enough.\n    *   This identifies the analog. Since Substance X contains the heavy isotope Deuterium, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 2: Verification of the Overall Reaction**\n\n*   The complete reaction sequence confirms the deductions: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This reaction is famously violent, it produces the identified gas W (D₂), and it forms an insoluble precipitate G (Aluminium deuteroxide). When G is heated, it releases B (D₂O). All parts of the puzzle fit perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**. The elements present are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   **Careful Point**: The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium), and the heaviest is Aluminium. Lithium is ignored for this calculation.\n*   **Careful Point**: We must use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved and sum the masses for all atoms of those elements.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is one atom of ²⁷Al. Mass = **27**.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are four atoms, present as the isotope Deuterium (²H). Mass = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe robust and unanimously agreed-upon analysis leads to the calculated value of 35. This value must be matched with the specific options provided in the prompt.\n\n**Question's Options**:\nA) 35\nB) 29\nC) 25\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating careful points identified from the candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B and the \"Heavier Isotope\"**\n\nThe first clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Reasoning:** Convert the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius: `277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C`. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This is distinctly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C.\n*   **Conclusion:** Substance B is heavy water, D₂O. This establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the reaction is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n*   **Careful Point 1:** Correctly converting the Kelvin temperature is the essential first step to identifying the substance.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\n\nThe gas W is described as having molecules that contain an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   **Reasoning:** Since the reaction system contains Deuterium, which is an isotope with 1 proton and 1 neutron, the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas, D₂. A D₂ molecule contains two such atoms, for a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The clue applies to the entire molecule (2 protons, 2 neutrons), not the individual atoms, reinforcing the identification of the gas as D₂.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X**\n\nThe identity of X is revealed by several clues, primarily its role in an organic reaction.\n*   **Reasoning:** X's \"very close analog\" reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid possesses at least 3 oxygen atoms (one from a ketone group >C=O, and two from a carboxylic acid group -COOH). For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH). This is a difficult reaction that requires a very strong reducing agent. The canonical reagent for this transformation is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Since Substance X contains the heavy isotope Deuterium, it must be the deuterated version.\n*   **Conclusion:** Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Recognizing that reducing a carboxylic acid requires a powerful agent like LiAlH₄ (and not a milder one like NaBH₄) is a critical piece of chemical knowledge needed to solve the puzzle.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Entire Reaction**\n\nThe complete reaction scheme must be consistent with all given information.\n*   **Reasoning:** The violent reaction of X (LiAlD₄) with liquid Y produces W (D₂) and precipitate G. The liquid Y must be D₂O to yield deuterated products. The full reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`. This reaction is famously violent. The precipitate G is Aluminium Deuteroxide, which when heated decomposes to release D₂O (B).\n*   **Conclusion:** All clues align perfectly with the identified substances.\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present:** The constituent elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   **Lightest & Heaviest Elements:** The lightest element is Hydrogen (by lowest atomic number, Z=1). The heaviest element is Aluminium (by highest atomic number, Z=13).\n*   **Mass Summation:** The calculation requires summing the integer mass numbers of *all* atoms of these two elements, using their specific isotopes.\n    *   Mass of heaviest element (Aluminium): There is one atom of ²⁷Al. Mass contribution = **27**.\n    *   Mass of lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium): There are four atoms of ²H. Mass contribution = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 27 + 8 = **35**.\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The \"lightest\" and \"heaviest\" elements are determined by atomic number (Z), not the mass number of the specific isotope.\n*   **Careful Point 5:** The word \"cumulative\" and the plural \"masses\" indicate that the mass of *all four* atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen) must be included.\n*   **Careful Point 6:** It is critical to use the mass number of the specific isotope involved (2 for Deuterium), not the mass of the most common hydrogen isotope (1) or the average atomic weight from the periodic table.\n\nThe calculation consistently and robustly yields the number 35.

The solution is derived by methodically piecing together a series of chemical clues. Here is a step-by-step breakdown highlighting the careful points required for an accurate solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heavier Isotope via Substance B**\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The temperature is in Kelvin. It must be converted to Celsius for easier comparison with common substances: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   **Analysis:** This melting point is significantly different from that of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C. It is, however, an almost perfect match for the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is 3.82 °C.\n*   **Conclusion:** This key piece of information identifies Substance B as D₂O and, crucially, establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" central to the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\nThe gas W released during the reaction has molecules that \"contain the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The clue applies to the entire molecule of the gas, not just a single atom.\n*   **Analysis:** In a system confirmed to contain Deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron), the logical gaseous molecule to form is di-deuterium gas, **D₂**. A D₂ molecule contains a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly satisfying the condition.\n*   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X using Organic Chemistry Clues**\nSubstance X is identified by its chemical reactivity, specifically through a \"very close analog\" used in organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction:** This analog reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one from a ketone group >C=O and two from a carboxylic acid group -COOH). To reduce the total oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol group (-COOH → -CH₂OH).\n*   **Careful Point:** One must know the relative power of different reducing agents. This specific reduction is a difficult transformation that requires a very strong reducing agent. The classic reagent for this is **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**.

Crucially, this reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned throughout the problem is **Deuterium (D, or ²H)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\nThe gas W released has molecules that \"contain the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n*   **Careful Point 2: Interpret \"Molecule\".** The clue applies to the entire molecule of the gas, not just a single atom.\n*   **Analysis:** Since the system involves Deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron per atom), the most logical gaseous product is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A D₂ molecule contains two deuterium atoms, resulting in a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This perfectly fits the description.\n*   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X**\nThe identification of X requires combining multiple clues, especially from organic chemistry.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Understand the Organic Reaction.** X's \"very close analog\" is an organic reagent that reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has a minimum of 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group >C=O and two in the carboxylic acid group -COOH). To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH). This transformation is a powerful reduction.\n*   **Analysis:** This specific and difficult reduction is characteristic of a very strong reducing agent. **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)** is the standard laboratory reagent for this, whereas milder reagents (like NaBH₄) are not strong enough.

Identification of Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**\n*   **The Clue:** Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Analysis:** First, convert the temperature to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C.

Substance X's \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\".\n    2.  This reagent reacts with a \"keto acid\" to yield a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n*   **Analysis:** A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., in a ketone group >C=O and a carboxylic acid group -COOH). For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol group (-COOH → -CH₂OH). This specific transformation requires a very powerful reducing agent. The canonical reagent for this task is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Milder reagents are not strong enough.\n*   **Conclusion:** The \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains the heavy isotope Deuterium, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Knowledge of the relative strengths of common organic reducing agents (LiAlH₄ vs. NaBH₄) is essential here.\n\n**4. Verification of the Entire Reaction**\n*   The proposed identities must fit the complete reaction description: `LiAlD₄ (X) + Y → G + W`.\n*   Since the products are deuterated, the liquid reactant Y must be D₂O. The full reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n*   This reaction is consistent with all clues: it is known to be violent, it releases D₂ gas (W), and it forms an insoluble precipitate G (Aluminium deuteroxide), which upon heating would decompose and release D₂O (B).\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present:** The elements are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (identified by the lowest atomic number).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium (identified by the highest atomic number).\n*   **Calculation:** The task requires summing the integer mass numbers of *all* atoms of these two elements, using their specific isotopes.\n    *   Mass contribution from the **heaviest element** (Aluminium): There is one atom of Aluminium.

This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C, which is significantly different from the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O).\n*   **Conclusion:** This identifies Substance B as **D₂O** and establishes the \"heavier isotope\" as **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly identify the melting point of D₂O as being anomalously higher than H₂O, a well-known chemical fact.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\n*   **Clue:** The molecule of gas W contains \"the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n*   **Analysis:** A Deuterium atom contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.

For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol group (-COOH → -CH₂OH), which removes one oxygen atom. This is a powerful reduction.\n*   **Conclusion:** The standard reagent for this strong reduction is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (**LiAlH₄**). Milder reagents like NaBH₄ are not capable of this. Since Substance X contains Deuterium, it must be the deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Differentiating the reactivity of powerful reducing agents (like LiAlH₄) from milder ones (like NaBH₄) is key to identifying the analog.\n\n**Step 4: Final Calculation**\n*   **Task:** Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Elements Present:** Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (present as Deuterium).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium.\n*   **Calculation:** The question asks for a cumulative sum, meaning we must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using their specific isotopic mass numbers.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is **one** atom of the stable isotope of Aluminium (²⁷Al).

All candidates correctly identified the core chemical principles and reached the same numerical conclusion, with discrepancies only arising from the random ordering of the multiple-choice options they were presented with.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis incorporating the necessary careful points:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heavier Isotope and Substance B**\nThe initial and most important clue is the melting point of substance B, given as \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Careful Point 1: Temperature Conversion.** The temperature must be converted from Kelvin to Celsius to be easily compared with common substances: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Isotopic Effects on Physical Properties.** The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C, while the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C.

A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly satisfying the condition.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X**\nThe identity of X is revealed through several organic chemistry clues.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Analyzing the Organic Reaction.** A \"keto acid\" has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group and two in the carboxylic acid group). The reaction product has only 2 oxygens. This means a single oxygen atom was removed. This happens when a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol group (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Careful Point 5: Differentiating Reagent Strengths.** This specific reduction is a powerful one. A common reagent like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is not strong enough. The canonical reagent for this transformation is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). This must be the \"very close analog\".\n*   **Conclusion:** Since Substance X contains Deuterium, it must be the deuterated version: **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Entire Reaction Sequence**\nThe reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.

Therefore, the lightest is Hydrogen and the heaviest is Aluminium.\n*   **Careful Point 7: Summing all Relevant Atoms.** The term \"cumulative\" means we must sum the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.

This matches option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong and unanimous consensus on the chemical reasoning and the final calculated value. The discrepancies in the letter choices among the candidates are due to the shuffling of the options, but the core logic remains identical and sound. Here is a definitive step-by-step analysis incorporating the critical points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**\n*   The first critical clue is the melting point of substance B, \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Careful Point:** It is essential to convert this temperature to Celsius to compare it with known melting points: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C. This value is a nearly perfect match for the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is 3.82 °C. This is distinctly different from normal water (H₂O) which melts at 0 °C.\n*   **Conclusion:** This identifies Substance B as D₂O and, crucially, establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" is **Deuterium (D, or ²H)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\n*   The gas W, released during the reaction, has molecules with \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n*   **Careful Point:** This clue must be interpreted within the established context that the system contains Deuterium. A Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a diatomic molecule of Deuterium gas (**D₂**) will contain 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X**\n*   This step requires synthesizing multiple clues, particularly from organic chemistry. X (or its \"very close analog\") reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n*   **Careful Point:** A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (in the ketone `>C=O` and carboxylic acid `-COOH` groups). For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-COOH → -CH₂OH`), a reaction that removes one oxygen atom. This is a difficult transformation that requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n*   **Conclusion:** The famous reagent capable of this is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Since Substance X contains the isotope Deuterium, **Substance X must be the deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Entire Reaction**\n*   **Careful Point:** Good practice dictates confirming that all identified substances fit the overall reaction narrative: `X reacts violently with liquid Y ... with the release of a gas W ... and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B`.\n*   The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑` is consistent with all clues: it is violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms an insoluble precipitate G (Aluminium deuteroxide), which upon heating correctly releases B (D₂O). The chemical puzzle is internally consistent.\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Final Calculation**\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Identify the elements first by atomic number: Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13). The lightest is Hydrogen, and the heaviest is Aluminium. Lithium is not part of the calculation.\n*   **Careful Point:** The term \"cumulative\" means summing the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements. The molecule has four atoms of Hydrogen and one atom of Aluminium.\n*   **Careful Point:** Use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved in LiAlD₄, as implied by the integer answer choices. These are ²H (Deuterium, mass = 2) and ²⁷Al (Aluminium, mass = 27).\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass from heaviest element (Aluminium): 1 atom × 27 = 27\n    *   Mass from lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium): 4 atoms × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**\n\nThe calculated result is 35. This must be matched with the options provided in the original question:\nA) 29\nB) 31\nC) 35\nD) 25\n\nThe value 35 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the step-by-step reasoning required to solve this problem. The final numerical answer is consistent across all analyses. Here is a breakdown of the logical path, highlighting the careful points required for a correct solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**\n    *   The first concrete clue is that Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** It is crucial to correctly convert this temperature and compare it to known values. 277 K is equal to 3.85 °C (277 - 273.15). This value is an almost perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C, and is significantly different from normal water's (H₂O) melting point of 0 °C.\n    *   This establishes that **Substance B is D₂O**, and therefore the \"heavier isotope\" central to the problem is **Deuterium (D, or ²H)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W**\n    *   Gas W's molecules are described as containing an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** This must be interpreted in the context of the newly identified isotope, Deuterium, which contains 1 proton and 1 neutron. A molecule of Deuterium gas (**D₂**) consists of two such atoms, for a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly fitting the description. Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X**\n    *   This step relies on interpreting the organic chemistry clues correctly. A \"keto acid\" has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group and two in the carboxylic acid group). The reaction with X's \"analog\" results in a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** This requires a powerful reduction of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), which removes one oxygen atom. This specific transformation is a hallmark of the powerful reducing agent **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)** and cannot be achieved by milder reagents.\n    *   Since X is the deuterated analog, we can confidently identify **Substance X as Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Entire Reaction Sequence**\n    *   The proposed identities must fit the full reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    *   This reaction is famously violent, it releases D₂ gas (W), and it forms a precipitate, Aluminium Deuteroxide (G). Heating this precipitate would correctly release D₂O (B). All clues align perfectly.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\" (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Careful Point 4:** The lightest element is determined by atomic number (Z), which is Hydrogen (Z=1), and the heaviest is Aluminium (Z=13).\n    *   **Careful Point 5:** The calculation must sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two types, using the mass numbers for their specific isotopes.\n        *   **Heaviest (Aluminium):** There is one atom of ²⁷Al.

Total mass = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**.\n\nMatching the calculated value of 35 to the options provided:\nA) 25\nB) 29\nC) 35\nD) 31\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals an exceptionally strong and unanimous consensus on the core reasoning and the final numerical calculation. The differences in the final letter choices are merely an artifact of shuffled multiple-choice options for each agent. The definitive solution can be synthesized by following a clear, logical path, paying attention to several key details.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the \"Heavier Isotope\"**\n    *   **Clue:** Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   **Careful Point:** The first step is to accurately convert this temperature. 277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C (277 K - 273.15 K). This is a crucial data point.\n    *   **Analysis:** This value is an almost perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C, and distinctly different from normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substance B is definitively identified as D₂O. This establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" central to the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W**\n    *   **Clue:** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This must be interpreted in the context of the already-identified Deuterium isotope (1 proton, 1 neutron).\n    *   **Analysis:** The most logical candidate for a gas in this system is di-deuterium, D₂. A D₂ molecule contains two deuterium atoms, resulting in a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Gas W is **D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X**\n    *   **Clue:** X, or its \"very close analog,\" reduces a keto acid to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A deep understanding of the organic reaction is necessary. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., from one ketone group >C=O and one carboxylic acid group -COOH). To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH). This is a powerful reduction.\n    *   **Analysis:** This specific transformation is characteristic of a strong reducing agent. **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)** is the standard laboratory reagent for this, as weaker reagents (like NaBH₄) are insufficient.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The analog is LiAlH₄. Therefore, Substance X, which contains deuterium, must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Entire Reaction**\n    *   **Clues:** `X reacts violently with liquid Y → gas W + precipitate G`, and `G → B` upon heating.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The entire proposed scheme must be chemically consistent.\n    *   **Analysis:** The reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`. This is known to be a violent reaction, it correctly identifies Y as D₂O, produces W (D₂), and forms a precipitate G (insoluble Aluminium Deuteroxide). Heating G (`2Al(OD)₃`) would decompose it to release B (D₂O). The chemical puzzle fits together perfectly.\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n    *   **Question:** Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Careful Point:** Identify the elements based on atomic number (Z): Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13). Therefore, the lightest is Hydrogen and the heaviest is Aluminium. The term \"cumulative\" requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two types. Integer answer choices imply using integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is one atom of ²⁷Al. Mass = **27**.\n        *   Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen, as Deuterium): There are four atoms of ²H. Total mass = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n        *   **Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe rigorous chemical analysis unanimously leads to a calculated value of 35. Matching this result with the provided options:\nA) 31\nB) 35\nC) 29\nD) 25\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers reveals a unanimous and correct line of reasoning to solve this multi-step chemical problem. The final numerical answer is consistent across all analyses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances and the Isotope**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Interpreting the Melting Point.** The first clue is the melting point of substance B, \"very close to 277 K.\" Converting this to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 K) gives 3.85 °C. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)** at 3.82 °C, and is significantly different from normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C. This identifies substance B as D₂O and reveals the \"heavier isotope\" to be **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Deducing the Gas.** The gas W's molecules have an equal number of protons and neutrons. Within a chemical system now known to contain Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the only logical gas is **di-deuterium (D₂)**, as a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Recognizing the Organic Reaction.** Identifying substance X requires specific knowledge of organic chemistry. X's \"very close analog\" reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., from >C=O and -COOH groups). To lose an oxygen atom, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) must be reduced to a primary alcohol group (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Reagent Specificity.** This powerful reduction is a characteristic reaction of **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)** and cannot be achieved by milder reagents. Therefore, the analog is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains Deuterium, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verification of the Overall Process**\n\nThe entire sequence of events confirms these identifications. The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑` is famously violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate (G, Aluminium Deuteroxide) that, upon heating, would release D₂O (B). All clues are consistent.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Identifying the Correct Elements.** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest** and **heaviest** elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄). The elements present are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13). Based on atomic number (Z), Hydrogen is the lightest and Aluminium is the heaviest.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Summing the Isotopic Masses.** The calculation requires summing the integer mass numbers for all atoms of the relevant elements, using their specific isotopes found in the molecule.\n    *   Heaviest element (Aluminium): There is one atom of ²⁷Al. Mass contribution = **27**.\n    *   Lightest element (Hydrogen): There are four atoms of the isotope Deuterium (²H). Mass contribution = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n*   **Final Sum:** 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\nThe calculated value is 35. Comparing this result with the options provided in the problem description:\nA) 25\nB) 29\nC) 35\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning found in the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points for a correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B and the \"Heavier Isotope\"**\n\nThis is the critical first step that unlocks the entire problem.\n*   **The Clue:** Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Analysis:** We must convert the temperature to the more familiar Celsius scale: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   **Identification:** This temperature is distinctly different from the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O) but is a near-perfect match for the 3.82 °C melting point of heavy water (D₂O).\n*   **Conclusion:** This confidently identifies **Substance B as D₂O**. It also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" central to the problem is **Deuterium (D, or ²H)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Failing to recognize the significance of the 277 K melting point as referring to D₂O would make the rest of the problem impossible to solve correctly.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\n\n*   **The Clue:** The molecule of Gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n*   **Analysis:** This clue must be interpreted within the context established in Step 1—that the system involves Deuterium. A single Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a molecule of Deuterium gas (**D₂**) consists of two such atoms, for a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂, as the number of protons and neutrons are equal (2 of each).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X using all available clues**\n\n*   **The Clue:** The most important clue is that Substance X, or its \"very close analog,\" reduces a \"certain keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n*   **Analysis:** A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group, >C=O, and two in the carboxylic acid group, -COOH). To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH). This is a powerful reduction that not all reducing agents can perform.\n*   **Identification of the Reagent:** This specific reaction is characteristic of the powerful reducing agent **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Milder, more common reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot reduce carboxylic acids. Thus, the \"analog\" is LiAlH₄.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since Substance X contains the Deuterium isotope, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Specific knowledge of the reactivity of common organic reagents is required here. Mistaking the reagent for something weaker would lead to an incorrect identification of X.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Entire Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** `X (LiAlD₄) + Y (liquid) → G (precipitate) + W (D₂)`\n*   **Verification:** For all the products to be deuterated, the liquid Y must also be deuterated, making it **D₂O**. The full reaction `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → Al(OD)₃ + LiOD + 4D₂` is consistent with all clues. It is famously violent, produces D₂ gas, and forms an insoluble precipitate of Aluminium Deuteroxide (`Al(OD)₃`), which when heated releases D₂O. The logical chain is complete and sound.\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Final Calculation**\n\n*   **The Task:** Calculate the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present:** Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13). The lightest is Hydrogen, and the heaviest is Aluminium.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Identify the **heaviest element**: Aluminium (Al). There is **one** atom of Al in the formula. Its stable isotope is ²⁷Al, so its mass number is **27**.\n    2.  Identify the **lightest element**: Hydrogen (H). It is present as the isotope Deuterium (²H). There are **four** atoms of D in the formula. Its mass number is **2**.\n    3.  Sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements: (Mass of Al) + (Total mass of D) = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n*   **Careful Point:** The question requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements. It is also crucial to use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved (²H and ²⁷Al), not the average atomic masses from the periodic table.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35. This corresponds to option D in the provided list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on the unanimous and correct reasoning presented across all candidate answers, the solution can be finalized through a careful, step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**\n*   **Clue:** Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Analysis:** Converting the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C, and significantly different from the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O).\n*   **Conclusion:** This confidently identifies Substance B as D₂O. Consequently, the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D, or ²H).\n*   **Careful Point:** This initial deduction is the cornerstone of the entire solution. Correctly identifying D₂O from its melting point is the critical first step.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\n*   **Clue:** The molecule of gas W contains \"the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n*   **Analysis:** A single Deuterium atom (identified in Step 1) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a diatomic gas molecule of Deuterium (D₂) would contain 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is the only logical candidate that can be formed from the established reactants.\n*   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is important to consider the chemical context. While other molecules might have an equal number of protons and neutrons (e.g., Helium-4), only D₂ can be formed in this specific reaction system.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X**\n*   **Clue:** The \"very close analog\" of Substance X is a common organic reagent that reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n*   **Analysis:** A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group and two in the carboxylic acid group). For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), which removes one oxygen atom. This transformation requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n*   **Conclusion:** The canonical reagent capable of this reduction is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Since Substance X contains the Deuterium isotope, it must be the deuterated version, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Differentiating between the strength of reducing agents is crucial. A milder agent like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot reduce carboxylic acids, so knowing this detail is key to identifying LiAlH₄ as the analog.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Complete Reaction Sequence**\n*   **Clue:** X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W, and forming a precipitate G, which upon heating releases B.\n*   **Analysis:** The full reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑` is consistent with all clues. The reaction is famously violent; liquid Y must be D₂O to supply the deuterium for the products; it forms an insoluble precipitate G (Aluminium deuteroxide); and heating this precipitate would decompose it and release B (D₂O). All parts fit perfectly.\n\n### Final Calculation\nThe final task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Identify Elements:** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13). The lightest is Hydrogen, and the heaviest is Aluminium.\n*   **Sum Masses:** The question asks for a cumulative sum, using the specific isotopic masses.\n    *   **Mass of Heaviest Element (Aluminium):** There is one atom of ²⁷Al. Mass = **27**.\n    *   **Mass of Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms, present as the isotope Deuterium (²H). Mass = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis consistently and robustly leads to a final calculated value of 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is a unanimous and correct consensus on the chemical reasoning and the final calculated value. The discrepancies in the letter choices among the agents are due to the shuffling of the multiple-choice options, but the core logic is identical and sound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identification of the Key Isotope and Substances**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The clue is the melting point of substance B, \"very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   **Careful Point**: It is crucial to correctly convert the Kelvin temperature to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C) and compare it to known melting points. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C, and not normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C. This single clue establishes that Substance B is D₂O and the \"heavier isotope\" is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n*   **Gas W**: The gas molecule W has an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This clue must be interpreted within the established context that the system contains Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron). The most logical gaseous molecule is **D₂**, which contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly fitting the description.\n*   **Substance X and its Analog**: X's \"very close analog\" is an organic reagent that reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one from the ketone group and two from the carboxylic acid group). The reaction removes one oxygen atom.\n    *   **Careful Point**: It is essential to recognize the chemical transformation being described: the reduction of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). This requires a powerful reducing agent. The well-known reagent for this is **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Milder agents are not strong enough.\n    *   This identifies the analog. Since Substance X contains the heavy isotope Deuterium, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 2: Verification of the Overall Reaction**\n\n*   The complete reaction sequence confirms the deductions: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This reaction is famously violent, it produces the identified gas W (D₂), and it forms an insoluble precipitate G (Aluminium deuteroxide). When G is heated, it releases B (D₂O). All parts of the puzzle fit perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.

Lithium is ignored for this calculation.\n*   **Careful Point**: We must use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved and sum the masses for all atoms of those elements.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is one atom of ²⁷Al. Mass = **27**.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are four atoms, present as the isotope Deuterium (²H). Mass = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe robust and unanimously agreed-upon analysis leads to the calculated value of 35. This value must be matched with the specific options provided in the prompt.\n\n**Question's Options**:\nA) 35\nB) 29\nC) 25\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating careful points identified from the candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B and the \"Heavier Isotope\"**\n\nThe first clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Reasoning:** Convert the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius: `277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C`. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This is distinctly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C.\n*   **Conclusion:** Substance B is heavy water, D₂O. This establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the reaction is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n*   **Careful Point 1:** Correctly converting the Kelvin temperature is the essential first step to identifying the substance.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\n\nThe gas W is described as having molecules that contain an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   **Reasoning:** Since the reaction system contains Deuterium, which is an isotope with 1 proton and 1 neutron, the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas, D₂. A D₂ molecule contains two such atoms, for a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The clue applies to the entire molecule (2 protons, 2 neutrons), not the individual atoms, reinforcing the identification of the gas as D₂.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X**\n\nThe identity of X is revealed by several clues, primarily its role in an organic reaction.\n*   **Reasoning:** X's \"very close analog\" reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid possesses at least 3 oxygen atoms (one from a ketone group >C=O, and two from a carboxylic acid group -COOH). For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH). This is a difficult reaction that requires a very strong reducing agent. The canonical reagent for this transformation is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Since Substance X contains the heavy isotope Deuterium, it must be the deuterated version.\n*   **Conclusion:** Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Recognizing that reducing a carboxylic acid requires a powerful agent like LiAlH₄ (and not a milder one like NaBH₄) is a critical piece of chemical knowledge needed to solve the puzzle.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Entire Reaction**\n\nThe complete reaction scheme must be consistent with all given information.\n*   **Reasoning:** The violent reaction of X (LiAlD₄) with liquid Y produces W (D₂) and precipitate G.

The solution is derived by methodically piecing together a series of chemical clues. Here is a step-by-step breakdown highlighting the careful points required for an accurate solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heavier Isotope via Substance B**\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The temperature is in Kelvin. It must be converted to Celsius for easier comparison with common substances: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   **Analysis:** This melting point is significantly different from that of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C. It is, however, an almost perfect match for the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is 3.82 °C.\n*   **Conclusion:** This key piece of information identifies Substance B as D₂O and, crucially, establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" central to the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\nThe gas W released during the reaction has molecules that \"contain the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The clue applies to the entire molecule of the gas, not just a single atom.\n*   **Analysis:** In a system confirmed to contain Deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron), the logical gaseous molecule to form is di-deuterium gas, **D₂**. A D₂ molecule contains a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly satisfying the condition.\n*   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X using Organic Chemistry Clues**\nSubstance X is identified by its chemical reactivity, specifically through a \"very close analog\" used in organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction:** This analog reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one from a ketone group >C=O and two from a carboxylic acid group -COOH). To reduce the total oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol group (-COOH → -CH₂OH).\n*   **Careful Point:** One must know the relative power of different reducing agents. This specific reduction is a difficult transformation that requires a very strong reducing agent. The classic reagent for this is **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Milder, common reagents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot do this.\n*   **Conclusion:** The analog is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X is noted for containing the heavier isotope, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** The constituent elements are Hydrogen (H, Z=1), Lithium (Li, Z=3), and Aluminium (Al, Z=13). Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen and the heaviest is Aluminium.\n*   **Careful Point:** The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using their specific isotopic mass numbers (implied by the integer answer choices).\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element: There is **one** atom of the stable isotope of Aluminium, ²⁷Al. Its mass number is **27**.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element: There are **four** atoms of Hydrogen, all present as the isotope Deuterium, ²H. Its mass number is **2**.\n*   **Summation:**\n    (Total mass of Al atoms) + (Total mass of H atoms)\n    = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2)\n    = 27 + 8\n    = **35**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe unanimous reasoning across all candidate agents leads to a calculated value of 35. Comparing this to the provided options in the question:\nA) 35\nB) 25\nC) 31\nD) 29\n\nThe calculated result of 35 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem, synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers and highlighting the careful points required at each stage.\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances and the Isotope**\n\n*   **Clue Analysis:** The starting point is Substance B, with a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Careful Point 1: Temperature Conversion.** It is crucial to accurately convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   **Identification:** This value (3.85 °C) is nearly identical to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C, and significantly different from the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O).\n*   **Conclusion:** This identifies **Substance B as D₂O**, which in turn establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" in the problem is **Deuterium (D, or ²H)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Gas W**\n\n*   **Clue Analysis:** Gas W has molecules containing an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Contextual Interpretation.** This clue must be solved within the established context that the system contains Deuterium. A Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   **Identification:** The simplest gaseous molecule that fits is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A D₂ molecule contains two deuterium atoms, for a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the clue.\n\n**3. Identification of Substance X**\n\n*   **Clue Analysis:** X's \"very close analog\" is a powerful organic reagent that reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with 2 oxygen atoms.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Understanding the Organic Reaction.** A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., from a ketone group >C=O and a carboxylic acid group -COOH). To reduce the product's oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH), which removes one oxygen atom.\n*   **Identification:** This specific and powerful reduction is a characteristic reaction of **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Milder, common reagents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot perform this reduction. Therefore, the \"analog\" is LiAlH₄.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since Substance X contains the deuterium isotope, it must be the deuterated analog: **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**4. Verification of the Overall Reaction**\n\n*   **Clue Analysis:** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W ... and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"\n*   **Careful Point 4: Assembling the Full Picture.** All pieces must fit together.\n    *   **Reaction:** `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`\n    *   This confirms: the reaction is violent; liquid Y must be D₂O; gas W is D₂; a precipitate G (Aluminium Deuteroxide, analogous to insoluble Al(OH)₃) is formed; and heating G (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) releases B (D₂O). The chemical narrative is entirely consistent.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\n*   **The Task:** Calculate the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄.\n*   **Careful Point 5: Identifying Lightest/Heaviest Elements.** The elements are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13). The lightest element is Hydrogen (by atomic number), and the heaviest is Aluminium.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Using Correct Isotope Masses and Quantities.** The calculation must use the specific mass numbers for the isotopes present (²H for Deuterium, ²⁷Al for Aluminium) and account for the number of atoms of each.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is **one** atom of ²⁷Al. Its mass number is **27**.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium): There are **four** atoms of ²H. The mass number is **2**. Total mass = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n*   **Final Sum:** 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\nThe consistent and robust reasoning across all steps leads to the final calculated value of 35. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct solution. The reasoning across all candidate answers is unanimous and chemically sound.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heavier Isotope and Substance B**\nThe first concrete clue is the melting point of substance B, stated to be \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Careful Point 1: Temperature Conversion.** It is crucial to correctly convert the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius to compare it with known melting points: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   **Analysis:** This value is significantly different from the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O) but is a near-perfect match for the 3.82 °C melting point of heavy water (D₂O).\n*   **Conclusion:** This identifies Substance B as D₂O. Crucially, this reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned throughout the problem is **Deuterium (D, or ²H)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\nThe gas W released has molecules that \"contain the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n*   **Careful Point 2: Interpret \"Molecule\".** The clue applies to the entire molecule of the gas, not just a single atom.\n*   **Analysis:** Since the system involves Deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron per atom), the most logical gaseous product is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A D₂ molecule contains two deuterium atoms, resulting in a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This perfectly fits the description.\n*   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X**\nThe identification of X requires combining multiple clues, especially from organic chemistry.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Understand the Organic Reaction.** X's \"very close analog\" is an organic reagent that reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has a minimum of 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group >C=O and two in the carboxylic acid group -COOH). To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH). This transformation is a powerful reduction.\n*   **Analysis:** This specific and difficult reduction is characteristic of a very strong reducing agent. **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)** is the standard laboratory reagent for this, whereas milder reagents (like NaBH₄) are not strong enough. This identifies the \"analog\".\n*   **Conclusion:** Since Substance X contains the isotope Deuterium, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe task is to calculate the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄.\n*   **Elements Present:** Hydrogen (Z=1, as isotope D), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13). The lightest element is Hydrogen, and the heaviest is Aluminium (determined by atomic number, Z).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Cumulative Summation.** The word \"cumulative\" and the phrase \"all the heavier and lighter isotopes\" imply we must sum the masses of all atoms of these two types present in the molecule.\n*   **Careful Point 5: Use Specific Isotope Masses.** The integer answer choices imply that we must use the integer mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved (²H and ²⁷Al), not the average atomic masses from the periodic table.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is **one** atom of the stable isotope of Aluminium (²⁷Al). Its mass number is **27**.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are **four** atoms, all present as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). Its mass number is **2**. The total mass is 4 × 2 = **8**.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 27 (from Aluminium) + 8 (from Deuterium) = **35**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe comprehensive and logically consistent analysis leads to a calculated value of 35. This matches option C in the provided question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a meta-analysis of the reasoning provided by the various agents, a consistent and robust logical pathway to the solution emerges. All candidate answers agree on the chemical identifications and the final numerical result, with discrepancies only arising from the random ordering of the multiple-choice options for each instance.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis incorporating all necessary careful points.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**\n    *   **Clue:** The melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** First, we convert the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** It is crucial to recognize that this value is not the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O) but is a near-perfect match for the 3.82 °C melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This confidently identifies Substance B as D₂O and reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" central to the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W**\n    *   **Clue:** The molecules of Gas W contain \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** A single Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** The clue refers to the *molecule*. The simplest gaseous molecule in this system would be **di-deuterium gas (D₂)**. A D₂ molecule contains a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂.\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance X**\n    *   **Clues:** The \"very close analog\" of X is a common organic reagent that reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Analysis:** A typical keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in a ketone group, >C=O, and two in a carboxylic acid group, -COOH). To reduce the product's oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH).\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** This specific and powerful reduction requires a very strong reducing agent. Knowledge of organic chemistry reagents is needed to identify that **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)** is the standard choice, while milder reagents (like NaBH₄) are insufficient.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The analog is LiAlH₄. Since substance X is known to contain the heavy isotope, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Verification of the Entire Reaction**\n    *   The overall reaction must be consistent: `LiAlD₄ (X) + Y → G + W`. We have identified X as LiAlD₄ and W as D₂. Since the products are deuterated, the liquid reactant **Y must be heavy water, D₂O**. The full reaction is:\n        `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`\n    *   **Careful Point 4:** This chemical equation validates all remaining clues. The reaction is famously violent; it forms an insoluble precipitate **G (Aluminium deuteroxide)**; and heating G (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) correctly releases **B (D₂O)**.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**\n    *   **Task:** Calculate the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X.\"\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Elements Present:** Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13).\n    *   **Careful Point 5:** The \"lightest\" and \"heaviest\" elements are determined by their atomic numbers (Z), making them Hydrogen and Aluminium, respectively.\n    *   **Careful Point 6:** \"Cumulative\" means we must sum the masses of *all* atoms of these specific elements in the molecule. The integer answer choices suggest using integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is one atom of ²⁷Al. Mass = **27**.\n        *   Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen, as Deuterium): There are four atoms of ²H. Mass = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n        *   Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\nThe unanimous and logically derived numerical answer is **35**.
