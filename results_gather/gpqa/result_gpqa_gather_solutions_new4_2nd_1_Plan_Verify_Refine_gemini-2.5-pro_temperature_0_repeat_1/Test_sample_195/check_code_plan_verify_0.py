    Checks the correctness of the answer for the relativistic harmonic oscillator problem.
    The final consolidated answer claims that Option A is the correct one.

    This function verifies this claim by:
    1. Deriving the expression for v_max from first principles (conservation of energy).
    2. Comparing the derived expression with the formula in Option A.
    3. Checking if Option A satisfies physical constraints (classical limit, v < c).
    4. Noting the inconsistencies in other options.
