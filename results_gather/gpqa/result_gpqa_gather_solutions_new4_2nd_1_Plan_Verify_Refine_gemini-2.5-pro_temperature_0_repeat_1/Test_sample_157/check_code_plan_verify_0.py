def check_dominant_negative_mutation_phenotype():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer about the molecular
    phenotype of a dominant-negative mutation in a dimeric transcription factor.

    It codifies the key biological principles:
    1.  **Dominant-Negative Definition**: A mutant protein that interferes with the
        wild-type (WT) protein, causing a loss-of-function phenotype even in a
        heterozygote.
    2.  **Mechanism for Dimeric Proteins**: Interference requires the mutant protein
        to be able to dimerize with the WT protein, forming a non-functional
        "poisoned" complex. A complete loss of dimerization would result in a
        recessive mutation.
    3.  **Genetic Effect**: The interference is precisely described as causing a
        "loss-of-function of the wild-type allele's" protein product.
    4.  **Cellular Response**: A common fate for such non-functional or aberrant
        protein complexes is to be recognized by cellular quality control and
        targeted for degradation.
