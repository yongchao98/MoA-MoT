This problem requires determining the major stereoisomer formed in a Diels-Alder reaction. The solution depends on a careful analysis of several stereochemical principles. The candidate answers show significant disagreement, particularly on the final IUPAC name assignment, making a step-by-step derivation essential.

### Step-by-step Analysis

**1. Identify the Reaction and Key Stereochemical Principles**

*   **Reaction Type**: The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder reaction) between 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene and maleic anhydride.
*   **Key Principles**: The stereochemistry of the major product, which is the kinetic product, is determined by two main factors:
    1.  **Endo vs. Exo Selectivity**: The orientation of the dienophile (maleic anhydride) relative to the diene.
    2.  **Syn vs. Anti Facial Selectivity**: The face of the diene that the dienophile attacks, relative to the fluorine substituent.

**2. Careful Point 1: Endo vs. Exo Selectivity**

*   **The Rule**: The Diels-Alder reaction is governed by the **Alder-Endo Rule**, which states that the kinetic product is the *endo* adduct. This preference arises from stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the π-system of the diene and the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile in the transition state. The small fluorine substituent does not override this strong electronic preference.
*   **Identifying the Adducts**: We must identify which IUPAC names correspond to the *endo* adduct. For this bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system, the relative stereochemistry of the bridgehead carbons and the carbons where the anhydride is attached defines the adduct type.
    *   Options A and B have the core stereochemistry `(3aR,4R,7S,7aS)`. This corresponds to the **exo** adduct.
    *   Options C and D have the core stereochemistry `(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)`. This corresponds to the **endo** adduct.
*   **Conclusion**: Since the *endo* product is major, we can eliminate the *exo* products, options **A** and **B**. The correct answer must be either C or D.

**3. Careful Point 2: Syn vs. Anti Facial Selectivity**

*   **The Principle**: This is the most subtle point. The dienophile can attack from the same side as the fluorine (*syn*-attack) or the opposite side (*anti*-attack). While a simple steric argument would favor *anti*-attack, it is a well-established principle that for small, electronegative substituents at the C5 position of cyclopentadiene (like F, OMe), electronic effects dominate. These effects stabilize the transition state for **syn-facial attack**.
*   **Conclusion**: The major reaction pathway involves the dienophile approaching the diene from the **same side** as the fluorine atom.

**4. Careful Point 3: Relating Attack Pathway to Final Product Structure**

*   **The Geometry**: It is crucial to correctly visualize how the favored attack pathway translates to the final product's structure. When the dienophile approaches from the *syn* face and the diene folds up to form the *endo* product, the C5-F group is pushed into a position that is **anti** relative to the anhydride ring.
*   **Conclusion**: The major product is the **endo, anti-adduct**.

**5. Careful Point 4: Assigning the Final IUPAC Stereodescriptor**

*   **The Task**: We have determined the major product is the *endo, anti-adduct*. We must now find its correct name, choosing between C and D, which only differ in the descriptor for the fluorine at C8.
    *   C) (3aR,4S,7R,7aS,**8s**)-...
    *   D) (3aR,4S,7R,7aS,**8r**)-...
*   **CIP Assignment**: We must assign the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) configuration for the C8 carbon in the *endo, anti-adduct*.
    1.  **Assign Priorities**: The substituents on C8 are F, H, C4, and C7.
        *   Priority 1: **F** (highest atomic number).
        *   Priority 4: **H** (lowest atomic number).
        *   To rank the two carbon paths (C4 vs. C7), we use the existing stereodescriptors of the *endo* framework: C4 is **S** and C7 is **R**. According to CIP rules, an R-center has priority over an S-center.
        *   The final priority order is: **(1) F > (2) C7(R) > (3) C4(S) > (4) H**.
    2.  **Determine R/S**: In the *anti*-adduct, the fluorine atom (priority 1) is on the opposite side of the anhydride ring. In a standard visualization, this places the C8-F bond pointing "up" and the C8-H bond pointing "down" (away from the viewer). Viewing the molecule along the C8-H bond (with the lowest priority group in the back), the sequence from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (F → C7 → C4) traces a **clockwise** path.
    3.  **Conclusion**: A clockwise path corresponds to the **R** configuration. Therefore, the correct descriptor for the *anti*-fluorine at C8 is **`8r`**.

### Final Conclusion

The major product is the **endo, anti-adduct**. This corresponds to the IUPAC name with the `(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)` skeleton for the *endo* structure and the `8r` descriptor for the *anti*-fluorine.

This matches option D.
