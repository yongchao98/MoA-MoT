    # --- Apply Conservation of Energy and Momentum ---
    # The derivation for the angle is as follows:
    # 1. Total initial energy: E_i = (gamma_e + gamma_p) * m * c^2 = 6 * m * c^2
    # 2. This energy is split between two photons of equal energy E_gamma: 2 * E_gamma = E_i
    #    Therefore, E_gamma = 3 * m * c^2
    # 3. The momentum of each photon is p_gamma = E_gamma / c = 3 * m * c
    # 4. Total initial momentum (vector sum): P_i = (sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1)) * m * c
    # 5. Total final momentum: P_f = 2 * p_gamma * cos(theta) = 2 * (3 * m * c) * cos(theta) = 6 * m * c * cos(theta)
    #    where theta is the angle of one photon to the horizontal axis.
    # 6. Equating P_i and P_f and cancelling m*c gives:
    #    cos(theta) = (sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1)) / 6
