    This function checks the correctness of the physics calculation for the given problem.
    
    The problem involves an electron-positron annihilation. The solution is found by
    applying conservation of energy and momentum using special relativity formulas.

    The derivation leads to the following formula for half the angle (theta) between the photons:
    cos(theta) = (sqrt(gamma_electron^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_positron^2 - 1)) / (gamma_electron + gamma_positron)
    
    The angle between the photons is 2 * theta.
