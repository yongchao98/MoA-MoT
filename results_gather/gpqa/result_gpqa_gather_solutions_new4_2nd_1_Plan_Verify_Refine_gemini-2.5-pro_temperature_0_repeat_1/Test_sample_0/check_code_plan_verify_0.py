    Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, including careful points to consider.

    ### Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Principle
    The core of this problem lies in the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. This principle establishes a fundamental limit on the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:

    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2

    where:
    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, also known as the **natural energy width** or **linewidth** of the quantum state.
    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state (τ).
    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).

    For practical calculations, we can use the approximation **ΔE ≈ ħ / τ**.

    **Careful Point:** A key takeaway is that a state with a *shorter* lifetime has a *larger* uncertainty in its energy. This means its energy level is "broader" or more "smeared out".

    ### Step 2: Calculate the Energy Width for Each State
    We must calculate the energy width (ΔE) for both quantum states to understand how "fuzzy" each energy level is.

    *   **State 1:**
        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s
        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**

    *   **State 2:**
        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s
        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**

    ### Step 3: Determine the Condition for "Clear Resolution"
    To "clearly distinguish" or "resolve" two energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the separation is smaller than the widths, the two broadened energy levels will overlap too much to be seen as distinct.

    **Careful Point:** The limiting factor for resolution is the state with the **larger energy width**. In this case, that is State 1 (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV), which has the shorter lifetime. Therefore, the condition for clear resolution is:

    |E₁ - E₂| >> ΔE₁
    |E₁ - E₂| >> 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV

    ### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options
    We must now compare the options provided in the original question against this condition.

    **Original Options:**
    A) 10⁻⁸ eV
    B) 10⁻¹¹ eV
    C) 10⁻⁹ eV
    D) 10⁻⁴ eV

    Let's check each one:
    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is **smaller** than the required separation of ~6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.
    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV. This is much **smaller** than the required separation.
    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is much **smaller** than the required separation.
    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is much **larger** than the required separation of ~6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.

    ### Conclusion
    The analysis shows that the energy uncertainty of the shorter-lived state is approximately 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. To clearly resolve the two levels, their energy difference must be significantly greater than this value. Of the choices provided, only 10⁻⁴ eV meets this condition.

    **Careful Point on Candidate Answers:** A review of the candidate answers shows that nearly all of them correctly perform the physics calculation and arrive at the correct numerical value (10⁻⁴ eV). However, many of them incorrectly map this value to the final lettered option (A, B, or C) because they seem to have used a different or re-ordered list of options in their internal reasoning. Based on the original question's option list, the value 10⁻⁴ eV corresponds to option D.
