    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, followed by a list of careful points to consider, leading to the final answer.

    ### Step-by-Step Analysis

    1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The problem states that the two-electron system is in the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle$. This state is an eigenstate of the total z-component of the orbital angular momentum operator, $L_z$. The crucial piece of information is that the quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum is **m = -1**.

    2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both individual z-components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, as $-\hbar$.
        *   The eigenvalue of an $L_z$ operator is given by $m_l\hbar$.
        *   An eigenvalue of $-\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number **m₁ = -1**.
        *   An eigenvalue of $-\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number **m₂ = -1**.
        *   This desired measurement outcome corresponds to the system being found in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\rangle$.

    3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the operator equation $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:
        $m = m_1 + m_2$

    4.  **Check if the Selection Rule is Satisfied:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is compatible with the initial state of the system.
        *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: $m = -1$.
        *   For the desired measurement outcome, we calculate the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.

    5.  **Conclusion:** The selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, as **-1 ≠ -2**. This means that the uncoupled state $|1, -1; 1, -1\rangle$ is not a component of the coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle$. The probability of measuring an outcome that violates a conservation law is zero.

    ### Careful Points

    *   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem requires understanding the relationship between the coupled basis ($|l, m\rangle$), which describes the total angular momentum, and the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\rangle$), which describes the individual components. The measurement of individual components projects the state from the coupled basis to the uncoupled basis.
    *   **The `m = m₁ + m₂` Selection Rule:** This is the most critical point. The probability is formally calculated as the square of the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. This coefficient is non-zero *only if* the selection rule is met. Since the rule is violated, the coefficient is zero, and thus the probability is zero.
    *   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** An alternative way to see this is to note that the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\hbar$. The final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with a different eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\hbar = -2\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. The probability of a system in one such state being measured in the other is zero.
    *   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** The reasoning presented in nearly all candidate answers (16 out of 17) correctly identifies that the probability is 0 due to the violation of the $m = m_1 + m_2$ rule. However, many of these answers then select an incorrect letter choice (A, B, or C), indicating a flaw in their final output step rather than their physical reasoning. The overwhelming consensus on the reasoning is that the probability is 0.

    Based on the unanimous physical reasoning, the probability is 0. This corresponds to option D.
