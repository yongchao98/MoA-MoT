    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the exoplanet density question.

    It performs two main steps:
    1.  Applies the physical principle of gravitational compression to determine which planet description (a, b, c, d) corresponds to the highest density.
    2.  Uses the specific mapping given in the question (A -> b, B -> a, C -> c, D -> d) to find the correct final letter choice.
