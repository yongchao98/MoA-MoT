    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the given chemistry question.
    
    The question asks for the EXO product of the [4+2] cycloaddition between
    2,5-dimethylthiophene and Furan-2,5-dione with heat.
    
    This function verifies the answer based on three key chemical principles:
    1.  The core structure derived from the reactants.
    2.  The type of stereoisomer formed under thermodynamic control (Heat).
    3.  The correct IUPAC stereochemical descriptor for that isomer.

    # --- Constraint 1: Correct Bridge Atom ---
    # The diene is 2,5-dimethylthiophene, which contains sulfur (S).
    # The resulting bridge in the Diels-Alder adduct must be a sulfur bridge.

        return "Incorrect. The answer does not satisfy the bridge atom constraint. The diene is thiophene, so the product must have a sulfur bridge ('epithio'), not an oxygen bridge ('epoxy')."

    # --- Constraint 2: Correct Base Name ---
