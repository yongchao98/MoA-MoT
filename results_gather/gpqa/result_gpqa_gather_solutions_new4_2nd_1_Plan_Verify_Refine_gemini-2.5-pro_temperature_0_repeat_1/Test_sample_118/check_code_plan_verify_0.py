Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.

### **1. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**

The problem describes a four-step organic synthesis. The key is to understand the transformation at each step.

*   **Step 1: Starting Material + H₂O → A**
    *   **Reaction:** Solvolysis (Sₙ1) of a bromoalkane.
    *   **Transformation:** The bromo group (-Br) is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH).
    *   **Product A:** An alcohol.

*   **Step 2: A + PDC → B**
    *   **Reaction:** Oxidation. PDC (Pyridinium dichromate) is an oxidizing agent.
    *   **Transformation:** The secondary alcohol (A) is oxidized to a ketone.
    *   **Product B:** A ketone.

*   **Step 3: B + H₂CPPh₃ → C**
    *   **Reaction:** Wittig reaction.
    *   **Transformation:** The ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) is replaced by a methylene group (=CH₂).
    *   **Product C:** An alkene with an exocyclic double bond.

*   **Step 4: C + TsOH → D**
    *   **Reaction:** Acid-catalyzed rearrangement. TsOH is a strong acid.
    *   **Transformation:** This is the most complex and decisive step.
        1.  The acid protonates the exocyclic double bond to form the most stable carbocation. Following Markovnikov's rule, the proton adds to the terminal CH₂ carbon, creating a new methyl group and a tertiary carbocation on the ring.
        2.  This carbocation then undergoes rearrangement to form a more stable structure.
        3.  A proton is eliminated to form the final, most stable alkene product, D.

### **2. Careful Points and Checkpoints**

Based on the reaction analysis, we can establish two critical checkpoints for the final product D.

*   **Checkpoint 1: Methyl Group Count**
    *   The starting material is a `dimethyl` compound (it has two methyl groups).
    *   The sequence of the Wittig reaction (Step 3) and acid-catalyzed protonation (Step 4) effectively converts a C=O group into a C(CH₃) group within a carbocation intermediate. This process adds a **third methyl group** to the molecule.
    *   Therefore, the final product **D must be a trimethyl derivative**.

*   **Checkpoint 2: Carbon Skeleton Rearrangement**
    *   The carbocation formed in Step 4 is adjacent to the highly strained four-membered `cyclobuta` ring.
    *   In carbocation chemistry, the relief of ring strain is a powerful thermodynamic driving force. A simple 1,2-methyl shift would be less favorable than a skeletal rearrangement that expands the strained 4-membered ring into a more stable 5-membered ring.
    *   Therefore, the final product **D is expected to have a rearranged carbon skeleton** where the initial [6,4,5] fused ring system has been converted into a more stable [5,5,5] fused ring system (a pentalene derivative).

### **3. Evaluation of the Options**

Let's evaluate the given options against our two checkpoints.

*   **A) 3a,5,5-trimethyl-1,2,3,3a,5,6,7,8-octahydrocyclopenta[1,4]cyclobuta[1,2]benzene**
    *   **Methyl Count:** `trimethyl` (3). Correct.
    *   **Skeleton:** `cyclobuta`. This is the original, unrearranged, and strained skeleton. This is the product of a less favorable methyl shift. Incorrect.

*   **B) 3a,4,5a-trimethyl-1,2,3,3a,5a,6,7,8-octahydrocyclopenta[c]pentalene**
    *   **Methyl Count:** `trimethyl` (3). Correct.
    *   **Skeleton:** `cyclopenta[c]pentalene`. This is a rearranged [5,5,5] skeleton, which is the expected, more stable product from the relief of ring strain. Correct.

*   **C) 3a,4a,5,5-tetramethyl-2,3,3a,4,4a,5-hexahydro-1H-cyclobuta[1,2:1,4]di[5]annulene**
    *   **Methyl Count:** `tetramethyl` (4). Incorrect.

*   **D) 3a,5-dimethyldecahydrocyclopenta[1,4]cyclobuta[1,2]benzene**
    *   **Methyl Count:** `dimethyl` (2). Incorrect.

### **Conclusion**

The only option that satisfies both critical requirements—having three methyl groups and the rearranged, more stable pentalene skeleton—is Option B. While many of the candidate answers arrive at the correct chemical reasoning, they often mislabel the final option letter. The sound chemical analysis points unequivocally to the structure described in B.
