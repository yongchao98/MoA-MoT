    This function verifies the provided solution by following the most chemically consistent path.
    1. It assumes the element Y is Platinum (Pt) based on the qualitative clues.
    2. It verifies that the mass percentage of A2 (PtF5) is a reasonable fit.
    3. It identifies A4 as PtF2 based on the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry.
    4. It calculates the molecular weight of A4 and checks which range it falls into.
    5. It compares the result with the provided answer.
