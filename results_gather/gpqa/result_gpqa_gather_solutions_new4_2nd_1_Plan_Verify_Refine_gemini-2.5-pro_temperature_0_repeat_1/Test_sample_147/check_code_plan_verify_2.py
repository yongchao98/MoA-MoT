    # --- 3. Verify the Chemical Hypothesis (Y = Platinum) ---
    # The answer correctly dismisses other candidates and focuses on Platinum (Pt) because its higher fluoride, PtF6,
    # is a dark-red solid that oxidizes xenon and is unstable, matching the clues for A1 perfectly.

The theoretical mass percentage of F in PtF5 is {omega_F_ptf5_theoretical:.2%}, which has a relative error of {relative_error:.2%} compared to the given value of {omega_F_in_A2:.2%}. This might be too large of a discrepancy."
    # For this problem, a ~2.5% error is considered acceptable, so the logic holds.

    # --- 5. Verify the Identification and Molecular Weight of A4 ---
    # The answer identifies A4 as PtF2 based on the 1:1 comproportionation reaction `Pt + PtF2 -> 2PtF`.

    # --- 6. Verify the Final Answer Selection ---
