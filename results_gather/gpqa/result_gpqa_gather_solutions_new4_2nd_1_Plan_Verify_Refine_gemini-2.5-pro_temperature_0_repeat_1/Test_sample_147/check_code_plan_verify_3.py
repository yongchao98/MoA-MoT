    # The answer's primary hypothesis is that Y = Platinum (Pt).

                f"molecular weight of {mw_ptf2:.2f} g/mol. However, the chosen answer '{llm_final_answer}' "
                f"corresponds to the range {chosen_range}, which does not contain this value. "
                f"The reasoning and the final answer are inconsistent.")

    # --- 4. (Optional) Check the "reasonableness" of the initial assumption ---
    # The answer assumes A2 is PtF5. Let's check its mass percentage.

    # The answer correctly identifies that this is a "reasonable fit" (~2.4% error),
    # and prioritizes the strong qualitative clues over a perfect numerical match from other candidates.
    # This is a valid approach in solving such problems.

    # --- 5. Final Verdict ---
