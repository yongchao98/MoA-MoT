Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate responses.

### Step 1: Analyze the Chemical Reaction
The core task is to identify the correct sequence of reagents (A) and the final product (B) for the α-alkylation of an iminium salt derived from pentan-2-one.

1.  **Starting Material**: `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, an intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. The key reactive part is the pentan-2-one skeleton (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).
2.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Stork enamine alkylation, a multi-step process.

### Step 2: Determine the Correct Reagent Sequence (A)
A multi-step synthesis requires a specific, logical order of reagent addition. All the detailed candidate answers agree on this fundamental principle.
*   **Step (i) - Deprotonation**: A strong base is needed to remove an α-proton and create a nucleophile (an enamine). `LDA` (Lithium diisopropylamide) is the strong base, and `DME` is the solvent. This must be the first step.
*   **Step (ii) - Alkylation**: The nucleophile created in step (i) attacks an electrophile. `CH₃CH₂I` (ethyl iodide) is the alkylating agent. This must be the second step.
*   **Step (iii) - Hydrolysis**: An acidic workup with `H₃O⁺` is required to hydrolyze the intermediate iminium salt back to the final ketone product. This must be the last step.

**Conclusion for A**: The only chemically valid sequence is the stepwise addition: `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`. Any option that groups reagents from different steps (e.g., adding the base and acid simultaneously) is synthetically incorrect. This eliminates options C and D from the prompt.

### Step 3: Determine the Final Product (B)
All detailed candidate answers correctly identify the regioselectivity of the reaction.
*   **Regioselectivity**: The starting ketone, pentan-2-one, has two different α-carbons: C1 (a methyl group) and C3 (a methylene group). `LDA` is a sterically hindered (bulky) base. Under kinetic control, it will preferentially remove a proton from the less sterically hindered position. The C1 methyl group is less hindered than the C3 methylene group.
*   **Alkylation**: Alkylation with the ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) will therefore occur at the C1 position.
*   **Structure Determination**:
    *   Original skeleton: `CH₃(C1)-C(=O)-CH₂(C3)-CH₂CH₃`
    *   Add an ethyl group to C1: `(CH₃CH₂)-CH₂(C1)-C(=O)-CH₂(C3)-CH₂CH₃`
    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.
*   **Nomenclature**: The longest carbon chain containing the carbonyl is seven carbons long (heptane). The carbonyl group is at position 4.

**Conclusion for B**: The final product is **heptan-4-one**.

### Step 4: Final Evaluation
We must find the option that matches our conclusions for both A and B.
*   **Correct Sequence (A)**: `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`
*   **Correct Product (B)**: `heptan-4-one`

Let's evaluate the options provided in the question:
*   A) `A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺` (Correct Sequence), `B = pentan-2-one...` (Incorrect Product).
*   B) `A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺` (Correct Sequence), `B = heptan-4-one` (Correct Product).
*   C) `A = (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O+...` (Incorrect Sequence), `B = pentan-2-one...` (Incorrect Product).
*   D) `A = (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O+...` (Incorrect Sequence), `B = heptan-4-one` (Correct Product).

Only option B correctly identifies both the valid, stepwise sequence of reagents and the correct final product. The discrepancies in the candidate answers' final letter choices likely stem from being presented with differently ordered multiple-choice options, but their underlying chemical reasoning is consistent and points to this conclusion.
