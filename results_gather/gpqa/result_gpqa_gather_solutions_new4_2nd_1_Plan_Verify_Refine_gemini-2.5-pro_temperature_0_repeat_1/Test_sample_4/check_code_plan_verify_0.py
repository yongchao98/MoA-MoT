    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the quantum mechanics problem.
    It symbolically calculates the eigenvector and compares it with the given answer.
    
    The question asks for the eigenvector of P_n corresponding to the eigenvalue +hbar/2.
    The final answer from the LLM is 'A', which corresponds to the vector (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).
    This code will verify if that vector is indeed the correct normalized eigenvector.
