    This function verifies the solution to the given astronomy problem.
    It calculates the theoretical value for the relative radius of the hypothetical exoplanet
    and compares it to the value corresponding to the provided answer choice.

    The problem involves two main steps:
    1. Calculate the amplitude of brightness variation from a rotating star with spots.
    2. Equate this amplitude to the transit depth of an exoplanet to find the planet's relative radius.
