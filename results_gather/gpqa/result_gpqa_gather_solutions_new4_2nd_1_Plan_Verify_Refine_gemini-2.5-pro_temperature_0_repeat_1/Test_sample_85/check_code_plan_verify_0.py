    # --- Problem Constraints ---
    # Reaction A: A + LiBH4 -> (R)-product
    # Reaction B: B + BH3 -> (S)-product
    # Starting material: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid
    # Chiral center groups: -H, -CH2CH3 (ethyl), -CH2COOH (acid_side), -CH2COOiBu (ester_side)

    # --- Step 1: Analyze Reaction A ---
    # Reagent: LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester.
    # Transformation: The ester_side (-CH2COOiBu) becomes an alcohol_side (-CH2CH2OH).
    # Initial CIP priorities: ester_side (P1) > acid_side (P2)
    # Final CIP priorities: acid_side (new P1) > alcohol_side (new P2)
    # Stereochemical outcome: The priorities of the top two groups swap, causing INVERSION of the R/S descriptor.
    # To get the (R) product, starting material A must be (S).

    # --- Step 2: Analyze Reaction B ---

    # Final CIP priorities: ester_side (new P1) > alcohol_side (new P2)
