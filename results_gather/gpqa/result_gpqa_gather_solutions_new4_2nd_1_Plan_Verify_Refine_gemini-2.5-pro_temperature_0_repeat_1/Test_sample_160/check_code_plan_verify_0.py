    # --- Step 1: Establish the physical relationship from the problem statement ---
    # The relationship between the two mean free paths (MFP) is derived from their formulas:
    # λ1 (gas-gas) = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)
    # λ2 (electron-gas) = 1 / (n * σ_eg)
    # The ratio is: λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)

    # --- Step 2: Establish the relationship between the cross-sections ---
    # For a high-energy (1000 keV) electron, it is highly penetrating and the atom is mostly
    # empty space. Therefore, the electron-gas scattering cross-section (σ_eg) is significantly
    # SMALLER than the kinetic gas-gas cross-section (σ_gg).
    # This means the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) must be greater than 1.
    # Let's represent this ratio as `sigma_ratio`.
    # We don't need an exact value, just the fact that sigma_ratio > 1.
    
    # --- Step 3: Derive the final inequality for the MFP ratio ---
    # Since λ2 / λ1 = √2 * sigma_ratio, and sigma_ratio > 1, it follows that:
    # λ2 / λ1 > √2
    # The value of √2 is approximately 1.414.
    # So, the core physical conclusion is: λ2 / λ1 > 1.414
    
    # Let's call the ratio λ2 / λ1 as R. The condition is R > 1.414.
    
    # --- Step 4: Evaluate the given options against the derived physical condition ---
    # The options as presented in the final answer are:
    # A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1  => R >= 1.22
    # B) λ2 = λ1         => R == 1
    # C) λ2 < λ1         => R < 1
    # D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 => 1 < R < 1.22
