def check_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the chemistry problem.

    The logic follows these steps:
    1.  Identify Substance Z based on its properties (mass fraction of H, saturation).
    2.  Identify the components of Mixture Y based on its properties and its relation to Z.
    3.  Apply the law of conservation of atoms to the disproportionation reaction (X -> Y)
        to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in Mixture X.
    4.  Verify that a plausible Mixture X exists that satisfies all given constraints.
    5.  Compare the calculated result with the provided answer.

    # --- Step 1: Identify and Verify Substance Z ---
    # The problem states Z is a saturated hydrocarbon with H mass fraction ~14.28% (1/7).
    # The general formula for a compound with H mass fraction 1/7 is CnH2n.
    # Since it's saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.
    # The problem implies a C6 skeleton for all compounds.
    # Therefore, Z is Cyclohexane (C6H12).
    z_formula = {'C': 6, 'H': 12}
    
    # Verify mass fraction constraint for Cyclohexane
    mass_fraction_h = (z_formula['H'] * 1) / (z_formula['C'] * 12 + z_formula['H'] * 1)
    if not (0.142 < mass_fraction_h < 0.143):
        return f"Constraint check failed: The mass fraction of hydrogen in Cyclohexane (C6H12) is not ~14.28%."

    # --- Step 2: Identify and Verify Mixture Y ---
    # Mixture Y contains Z (Cyclohexane) and another liquid (Y_prime).
    # Y_prime must hydrogenate to Z and not decolorize bromine water (i.e., is aromatic).
    # The only C6 aromatic compound is Benzene (C6H6).
    y_prime_formula = {'C': 6, 'H': 6}
    
    # --- Step 3: Apply Conservation of Atoms ---
    # The reaction is: Mixture X (A + B) -> Mixture Y (Z + Y_prime)
    # By the law of conservation of atoms, the total H atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.
    total_h_in_products = z_formula['H'] + y_prime_formula['H']
    
    # This is the calculated correct answer for the total H atoms in Mixture X.
    calculated_correct_answer = total_h_in_products
    
    # --- Step 4: Verify that a plausible Mixture X exists ---
    # Mixture X must consist of two C6 unsaturated, non-conjugated compounds.
    # Their total H atoms must sum to our calculated answer (18).
    # The most plausible candidates are Cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).
    x_comp_A = {'C': 6, 'H': 10}  # Cyclohexene
    x_comp_B = {'C': 6, 'H': 8}   # 1,4-Cyclohexadiene
    
    # Check if their H atoms sum correctly.
    if x_comp_A['H'] + x_comp_B['H'] != calculated_correct_answer:
        return f"Consistency check failed: The proposed components for Mixture X (Cyclohexene and 1,4-Cyclohexadiene) do not have a total of {calculated_correct_answer} hydrogen atoms."
    
    # Check other constraints conceptually:
    # - Decolorizes bromine water? Yes, both are unsaturated.
    # - No conjugated bonds? Yes, Cyclohexene has one double bond, and 1,4-Cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds.
    # - Hydrogenate to Z? Yes, both have a C6 skeleton.
    # The scenario is chemically consistent.

    # --- Step 5: Compare with the provided answer ---
