In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”
Which of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?

A) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.
B) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.
C) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.

final_answer = """
Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate responses.

**1. Deconstruct the Core Scientific Problem**

The central task is to produce polyethylene with "regular branches" using only ethylene as the reactant. This requires a tandem catalysis process where a dual-catalyst system performs two functions simultaneously in the same reactor:
*   **Function 1 (Oligomerization):** A first catalyst must selectively convert some ethylene molecules into a specific short-chain alpha-olefin (e.g., trimerizing three ethylenes into one 1-hexene molecule). The high selectivity is key to creating "regular" branches of a uniform length. This is the "essential additional reaction step."
*   **Function 2 (Copolymerization):** A second catalyst must take the remaining ethylene and the newly formed alpha-olefins and copolymerize them into a single polymer chain.

**2. Systematically Evaluate Each Statement**

Based on the provided candidate answers, a clear consensus emerges on the validity of each statement.

*   **Statement A: Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**
    *   **Analysis:** The candidate answers unanimously identify this statement as **factually incorrect**. The "essential additional reaction step" is the selective oligomerization of ethylene. The premier catalysts for this reaction (based on chromium) are organometallic compounds that require a co-catalyst, or "activator," to function. The most common and essential activators for these systems are organoaluminum compounds like methylaluminoxane (MAO). Far from "not working," they are crucial for the reaction.

*   **Statement D: Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**
    *   **Analysis:** There is a strong consensus that this statement is **incorrect in the context of the problem**. The prompt specifies the goal of creating "regular branches," which implies branches of a uniform length. While catalysts based on noble metals (e.g., palladium) can produce branched polyethylene, they typically do so via a "chain-walking" mechanism. This process creates a variety of branch types and lengths (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl), resulting in an irregularly branched polymer, not one with "regular branches." Therefore, this technology is not suitable for the stated goal.

*   **Statement C: Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**
    *   **Analysis:** The candidate answers consistently find this statement to be **ambiguous and likely incorrect** under a strict technical interpretation. While the component technologies (producing alpha-olefins from ethylene and producing polyethylene) are indeed massive industrial processes in the US, they are typically run in separate, dedicated plants. A true single-reactor "combined system" is a major research goal but is not the widespread industrial standard due to the difficulty of optimizing conditions for two different catalysts simultaneously. Therefore, the statement is an oversimplification of industrial reality.

*   **Statement B: One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**
    *   **Analysis:** There is unanimous agreement across all candidate answers that this statement is **factually correct and the best answer**. Group VIa (or Group 6) of the periodic table contains Chromium (Cr). The state-of-the-art industrial technology for the highly selective oligomerization of ethylene to 1-hexene (trimerization) and 1-octene (tetramerization) is based on chromium catalyst systems. This is precisely the function required to generate the specific comonomers needed for "regular branches." These catalysts indeed require "specific activators" to function. This statement describes the fundamental, enabling chemistry at the heart of the solution.

**3. Final Decision**

After systematically evaluating each option, it is clear that:
*   Statement A is definitively false.
*   Statement D describes an inappropriate technology for the specific goal.
*   Statement C is an ambiguous oversimplification of industrial practice.
*   Statement B is a direct, unambiguous, and factually correct description of the core chemical principle required to solve the scientist's problem.

Therefore, Statement B is the correct answer.
