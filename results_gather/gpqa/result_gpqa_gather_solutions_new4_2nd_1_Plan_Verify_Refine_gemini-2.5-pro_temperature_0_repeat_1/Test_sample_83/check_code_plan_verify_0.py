    Checks the correctness of the answer to a conceptual question about parallel algorithms in numerical analysis.

    The function formalizes the logic by:
    1. Defining the problem context.
    2. Defining the role of each option within that context.
    3. Identifying which role corresponds to the "key factor for converting" the algorithm.
    4. Comparing the option with that role to the provided answer.

    # Context:
    # 1. PDE -> System of ODEs: dU/dt = AU
    # 2. Solution step: U_new = exp(A*dt) * U_old
    # 3. Approximation: exp(z) is approximated by a rational function R(z) = P(z)/Q(z).
    # 4. Sequential Algorithm: Solve the single, large, coupled system Q(A*dt)U_new = P(A*dt)U_old.
    # 5. Parallel Goal: "Split" the single large task into multiple smaller, independent tasks.
    # 6. The question asks for the "key factor" that enables this "splitting" or "conversion".

    # An 'obstacle' is something that hinders the conversion.
    # A 'property' is a characteristic of the mechanism, but not the mechanism itself.
