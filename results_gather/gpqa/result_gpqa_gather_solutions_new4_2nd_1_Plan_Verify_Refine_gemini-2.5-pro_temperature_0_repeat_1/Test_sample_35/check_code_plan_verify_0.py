    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided analysis for the astrophysics question.

    It performs the following steps:
    1. Defines the physical constants and given values from the problem.
    2. Calculates the cosmological redshift (z) based on the distance.
    3. Calculates the rest-frame energy (E_rest) of the absorption line.
    4. Compares the calculated E_rest to the known energy of the 21-cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen.
    5. Verifies that the conclusion (Cold Atomic Interstellar Medium) is consistent with the physical principles,
       specifically that an *absorption* line at this energy traces the *cold* phase of the *atomic* medium.
