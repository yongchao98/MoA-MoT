def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the special relativity problem.

    The problem asks for the distance traveled by a supernova ejecta in the Galaxy's
    reference frame, given the relative velocity and the time elapsed in the
    ejecta's reference frame. This requires using the time dilation formula from
    special relativity.

    The distance in the Galaxy's frame (d) is calculated as d = v * Δt, where Δt
    is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (dilated time).
    The dilated time Δt is related to the proper time Δt₀ (time in the ejecta's frame)
    by the formula Δt = γ * Δt₀.
    The Lorentz factor γ is calculated as γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).
