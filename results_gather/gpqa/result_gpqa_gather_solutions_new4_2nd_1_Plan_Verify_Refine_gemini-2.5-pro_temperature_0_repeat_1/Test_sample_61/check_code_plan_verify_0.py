    Checks the correctness of the selected reaction sequence for the synthesis of
    1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane.

    The correct synthetic strategy is:
    1. Alkylation of the terminal alkyne to form an internal alkyne.
    2. Partial reduction of the alkyne to an alkene.
    3. Reductive ozonolysis of the alkene to form the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
    4. Base-catalyzed self-aldol addition of the intermediate.
