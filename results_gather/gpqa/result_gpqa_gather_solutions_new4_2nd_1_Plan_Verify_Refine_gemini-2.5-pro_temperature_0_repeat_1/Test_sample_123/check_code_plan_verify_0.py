    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the physics problem.

    The problem asks for the new Lorentz factor (gamma_2) required for a particle
    survival fraction of 2/3, given that at gamma_1 = 20, the survival fraction is 1/3.

    The relationship is f = exp(-K/gamma), where f is the survival fraction and K is a constant.
    This leads to the formula: gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(f1) / ln(f2).
    Or, more intuitively: gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(1/f1) / ln(1/f2).
