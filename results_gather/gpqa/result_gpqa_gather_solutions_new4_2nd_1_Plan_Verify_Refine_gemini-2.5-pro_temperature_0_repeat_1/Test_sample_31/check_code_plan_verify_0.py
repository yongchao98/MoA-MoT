    This function verifies the calculation for the total relativistic energy of a Lithium-6 nucleus.

    1. Calculates the Lorentz factor for v = 0.96c.
    2. Calculates the rest energy using the most likely intended approximation method.
    3. Calculates the total relativistic energy.
    4. Compares the result with the given options to confirm the chosen answer is correct.
