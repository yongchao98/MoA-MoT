Here is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.

### Step 1: Understand the Core Question
The question asks to identify the physical theory, from the given options, that does not require "regularization at high energies." This involves understanding a few key concepts:
*   **High-Energy Problem (Ultraviolet Divergence):** In many physical theories, particularly those based on point-like particles, calculations of interactions at extremely short distances (which correspond to very high energies) can lead to infinite results. This is a sign that the theory is breaking down at that scale.
*   **Regularization:** This is a mathematical technique used to manage these infinities. It involves temporarily modifying the theory (e.g., by introducing an energy "cutoff") to make the calculations finite. It is the first step in a process called renormalization, which ultimately yields physically meaningful, finite predictions.
*   **The Task:** The goal is to find the theory that is fundamentally constructed in a way that it avoids these high-energy infinities from the start, making the artificial procedure of regularization unnecessary. Such a theory is often called "UV-finite."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reasoning for Each Option
By synthesizing the explanations from the candidate answers, a strong consensus emerges on the physics of each theory:

*   **A) Classical Electrodynamics:** The consensus is that this theory, while not a quantum theory, has its own high-energy problem. The "self-energy" of a theoretical point-like electron is infinite. This shows the theory is incomplete at short distances and requires a form of regularization (like assuming the electron has a small but non-zero size) to avoid this infinity. Therefore, it **requires** regularization.

*   **B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** There is unanimous agreement that QCD, as a quantum field theory describing the strong force, suffers from ultraviolet divergences in its calculations (specifically in "loop diagrams"). It absolutely **requires** regularization and renormalization to be a predictive theory.

*   **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** There is unanimous agreement that QED is the classic example of a theory that **requires** regularization. The development of regularization and renormalization was a historic triumph that made QED's famously precise predictions possible, but the need for the procedure is fundamental to the theory.

*   **D) Superstring Theory:** There is overwhelming consensus that a primary motivation for Superstring Theory is to solve the problem of infinities. By postulating that fundamental particles are extended, one-dimensional "strings" instead of zero-dimensional points, the theory "smears out" interactions. This intrinsic property naturally eliminates the short-distance infinities (UV divergences) that plague the other theories. Therefore, it is believed to be UV-finite and **does not require** regularization.

### Step 3: Resolve Contradictions and Conclude
While the final lettered answers from the candidates are scattered (`A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` all receive votes), the detailed reasoning within the answers is remarkably consistent. The discrepancy arises because many candidate answers incorrectly map the theories to the letters A, B, C, and D.

The correct approach is to trust the overwhelming consensus in the physical reasoning. This reasoning clearly and consistently identifies that Classical Electrodynamics, QCD, and QED all require regularization, while Superstring Theory is the only one designed to be free of this requirement.

Matching this conclusion to the original question's options, Superstring Theory is listed as option D.
