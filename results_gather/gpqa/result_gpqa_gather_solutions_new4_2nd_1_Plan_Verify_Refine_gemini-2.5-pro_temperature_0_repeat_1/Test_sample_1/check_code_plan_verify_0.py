Based on an analysis of the candidate answers and an independent verification of the chemical principles, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct answer.

### **Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**

The problem describes a three-step organic synthesis. The goal is to track the number of carbon atoms through each step to find the total in the final product.

**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**
*   **Reactants**: *trans*-cinnamaldehyde + methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr).
*   **Analysis of Starting Material**: *trans*-cinnamaldehyde has the structure C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO. We count the carbons: 6 in the phenyl ring + 3 in the propenal chain = **9 carbon atoms**.
*   **Analysis of Reaction**: This is a Grignard reaction. The methyl group (CH₃) from the Grignard reagent adds one carbon atom to the molecule by attacking the carbonyl carbon.
*   **Carbon Count of Product 1**: 9 (from cinnamaldehyde) + 1 (from the methyl group) = **10 carbon atoms**.

**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**
*   **Reactants**: Product 1 + pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC).
*   **Analysis of Reaction**: PCC is an oxidizing agent. It converts the secondary alcohol (Product 1) into a ketone. This reaction is a functional group transformation and does not add or remove any carbon atoms from the molecular skeleton.
*   **Carbon Count of Product 2**: The carbon count remains unchanged at **10 carbon atoms**.

**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**
*   **Reactants**: Product 2 + (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane.
*   **Analysis of Reagent**: This is the systematic name for the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent, a sulfur ylide.
*   **Analysis of Reaction**: When the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent reacts with an α,β-unsaturated ketone (Product 2), it performs a conjugate addition, adding a methylene group (-CH₂-) across the carbon-carbon double bond to form a cyclopropane ring. This reaction adds exactly one carbon atom.
*   **Carbon Count of Product 3**: 10 (from Product 2) + 1 (from the methylene group) = **11 carbon atoms**.

### **Careful Points**

1.  **Initial Carbon Count**: The starting material, *trans*-cinnamaldehyde, has exactly 9 carbon atoms.
2.  **Reaction Carbon Changes**: It is crucial to know how each reaction affects the carbon count:
    *   Grignard addition of CH₃MgBr: +1 Carbon
    *   PCC Oxidation: +0 Carbons
    *   Corey-Chaykovsky Cyclopropanation: +1 Carbon
3.  **Typo in the Question**: The prompt states, "3 was treated...". This is a clear typo. The logical sequence, correctly identified by the candidate answers, is that "Product 2 was treated..." to form Product 3.
4.  **Reagent Specificity**: The Corey-Chaykovsky reagent's reaction with an α,β-unsaturated ketone is specific: it forms a cyclopropane at the double bond, not an epoxide at the ketone. This is a key distinction from other ylides (like the Wittig reagent).

### **Conclusion**

The final product, Product 3, contains **11 carbon atoms**. Matching this result with the provided options:
A) 10
B) 12
C) 11
D) 14

The correct option is C.

<<<C>>>
