    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the given organic chemistry problem.

    The problem involves two steps:
    1. A directed aldol addition between cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde.
    2. A reaction of the aldol product with excess DAST.

    The correctness hinges on two key stereochemical points:
    - The diastereoselectivity of the aldol addition (syn vs. anti).
    - The stereospecificity of the DAST fluorination of the alcohol (inversion vs. retention).
