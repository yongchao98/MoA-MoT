    # 1. (R) + (R)
    # 2. (S) + (S)
    # 3. (R) + (S)

    # --- Rigorous Stereochemical Analysis ---

    # 1. (R) + (R) pairing -> (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene

    # distinct compounds, they are counted.

    # (Z)-(3R, 6S) isomer: Has a C2 axis but no plane of symmetry or center of inversion.

    # it must be formed as a racemic pair with its enantiomer, (Z)-(3S, 6R).
