    # Analysis of Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate
    # This is a Michael Addition.
    # The base (t-BuOK) deprotonates the ketone at an alpha-carbon to form an enolate.
    # The ketone has two alpha-carbons: C2 and C6.
    # - C2 is quaternary and has no alpha-protons.
    # - C6 is tertiary and has one alpha-proton.
    # Therefore, deprotonation MUST occur at C6.
    # The C6 enolate attacks the beta-carbon of ethyl acrylate.
    # Naming convention: The ester has higher priority than the ketone, so the parent
    # chain is ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on C3.
    # To name the substituent, we number the ring from the point of attachment (old C6):
    #   - New C1 (old C6): has a methyl group.
    #   - New C2 (old C1): has an oxo group.
    #   - New C3 (old C2): has an ethyl and a methyl group.
    # The resulting substituent name is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).

    # The resulting carbanion attacks the beta-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.
    # The resulting structure is CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN.
    # Naming convention: The nitrile is the principal functional group. The parent chain
    # is the longest chain including the nitrile carbon, which is 6 carbons long (hexanenitrile).
