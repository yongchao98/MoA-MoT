    Checks the correctness of the answer to the chemistry problem.

    The problem is to find the volume of 0.1 M strong acid and the final pH
    to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in a total volume of 100 cm3.

    The method is to check the self-consistency of each option. For each
    (pH, Volume) pair, we calculate the volume of acid required to both
    neutralize the Fe(OH)3 and establish the given pH. If this calculated
    volume matches the volume given in the option, the option is consistent.
