    # We represent the products by their names for simplicity.
    # The logic follows standard organic chemistry rules.
    
    # Step 1: Nitration of Benzene
    # Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitrobenzene
    # This is a standard electrophilic aromatic substitution.
    product_1 = "Nitrobenzene"
    
    # Step 2: Bromination of Nitrobenzene
    # Nitrobenzene + Br2/Fe -> 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene
    # Key principle: The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong deactivator and a meta-director.
    # Therefore, the bromine atom adds to the meta position (position 3).
    product_2 = "1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene"
    
    # Step 3: Reduction of the Nitro Group
    # 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene + H2/Pd/C -> 3-bromoaniline
    # Key principle: Catalytic hydrogenation with H2/Pd/C is a standard method to selectively
    # reduce a nitro group to an amine without affecting an aryl-halide bond under these conditions.
    product_3 = "3-bromoaniline"
    
    # Step 4: Diazotization
    # 3-bromoaniline + NaNO2/HBF4 -> 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate
    # Key principle: Primary aromatic amines form diazonium salts with nitrous acid.
    product_4 = "3-bromobenzenediazonium salt"
    
    # Step 5: Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction
    # Diazonium salt + Anisole + heat -> 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl
    # Key principle 1: Heating the diazonium salt in the presence of another aromatic ring (anisole)
    # initiates a Gomberg-Bachmann reaction, not a Schiemann reaction (which would yield a fluoro-substituent).
    # Key principle 2: The reaction proceeds via a 3-bromophenyl radical.
    # Key principle 3: The methoxy group (-OCH3) on anisole is an ortho, para-director. Due to the steric
    # bulk of the incoming radical, the coupling occurs predominantly at the less hindered para position.
    # The final product connects C1 of the bromo-ring to C4' of the methoxy-ring.
