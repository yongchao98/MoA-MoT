def check_synthesis_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the chosen synthetic pathway for 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.

    This function evaluates each option based on key principles of organic chemistry:
    1.  **Friedel-Crafts Limitations**: These reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., with -NO2) and on anilines (due to Lewis acid-base reaction).
    2.  **Substituent Directing Effects**: It checks if the sequence of substitutions is logical based on ortho, para vs. meta directors.
    3.  **High-Yield Strategy**: It recognizes that achieving a 1,3,5-substitution pattern with conflicting directors often requires a sophisticated strategy, such as using a temporary directing group that is later removed.
    4.  **Logical Consistency**: It checks for nonsensical steps, like a reaction loop that returns to the starting material.

    Returns:
        str: "Correct" if the provided answer is the only valid pathway, otherwise a string explaining the error.
