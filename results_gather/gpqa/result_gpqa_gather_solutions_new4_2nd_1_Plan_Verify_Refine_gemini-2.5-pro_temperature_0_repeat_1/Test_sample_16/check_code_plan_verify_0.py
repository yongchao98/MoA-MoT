    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the chemistry problem.
    
    The problem is to find the concentration of calcium ions in a 0.02 M Ca-EDTA solution.
    - K_f = 5x10^10
    - The reaction is the dissociation: [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻
    - The dissociation constant Kd = 1 / Kf
    - The equilibrium expression is Kd = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]
    - Let x = [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] at equilibrium.
    - Then [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x.
    - So, Kd = x² / (0.02 - x).
    - Since Kd is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.
    - This gives Kd ≈ x² / 0.02, so x ≈ sqrt(Kd * 0.02).
