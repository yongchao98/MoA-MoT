    # 1. Analyze Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
    # This reaction is a cyanohydrin formation.
    # The mechanism involves two steps:
    #   a) Nucleophilic attack by the cyanide ion (CN-) from NaCN on the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.
    #      This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.
    #   b) Protonation of the negatively charged alkoxide intermediate to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.
    # Reagent A must be a proton source for step (b).
    # - H3O+ (hydronium ion) represents an aqueous acid and is an excellent proton source.
    # - NaHSO3 (sodium bisulfite) is a reagent for a different type of carbonyl addition (bisulfite adduct formation) and is not used to complete this reaction.
    # Therefore, the correct reagent A is H3O+.
    correct_reagent_A = "H3O+"

    # 2. Analyze Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid
    # This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-Câ‰¡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).
    # This transformation requires harsh conditions, typically heating with water and a strong catalyst.
    # Reagent B acts as the catalyst.
    # - HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid and is a standard, effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles.
    # - CH3COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not strong enough to efficiently catalyze this reaction to completion.
    # Therefore, the correct reagent B is HCl.
    correct_reagent_B = "HCl"
