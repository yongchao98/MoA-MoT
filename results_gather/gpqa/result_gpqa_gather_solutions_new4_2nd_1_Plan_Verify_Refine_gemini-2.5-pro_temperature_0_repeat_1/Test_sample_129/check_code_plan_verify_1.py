    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the astrophysics question.

    The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift (z) for the
    Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line to be detectable by ground-based optical telescopes.

    Key physics:
    1. Redshift formula: λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)
    2. Lyα rest wavelength (λ_rest) ≈ 1216 Angstroms.
    3. Ground-based telescopes are limited by the atmospheric cutoff wavelength.
       Light with λ < λ_cutoff is absorbed by the atmosphere.

    The core of the problem is determining the correct λ_cutoff to use.
