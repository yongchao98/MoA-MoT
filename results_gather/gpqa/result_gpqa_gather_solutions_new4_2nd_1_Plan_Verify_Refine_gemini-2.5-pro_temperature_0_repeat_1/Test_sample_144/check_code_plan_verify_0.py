    1. It parses the molecule's structure from its SMILES representation.
    2. It identifies and counts the number of chiral carbon centers.
    3. It identifies and counts the number of stereogenic double bonds (capable of E/Z isomerism).
    4. It calculates the total number of stereoisomers using the formula 2^n, where n is the total number of stereocenters.
    5. It compares this calculated value with the value corresponding to the provided answer option.
