    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the given chemistry question.
    
    The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.
    The code will verify two key aspects:
    1. Regioselectivity: Attack at the less hindered carbon.
    2. Stereoselectivity: Inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon.
