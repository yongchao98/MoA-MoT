    # Step 2.1: Identify Compound A from Hint (a) and (b).
    # Hint (a): Wittig reaction product is '1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane'.
    # A retro-Wittig analysis means replacing the '=C(CH3)2' group with a '=O' group.
    # This gives a ketone at position 4 of a 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane.
    # According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbonyl carbon gets priority (C1).
    # Renumbering the ring to give the methyl groups the lowest locants places them at C3 and C4.
    deduced_compound_A = "3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one"
    
    # Hint (b): IR of A is ~1750 cm^-1. This is characteristic of a strained 5-membered ring ketone (cyclopentanone).
    # Our deduced Compound A is a cyclopentanone, so this is consistent.
    if "cyclopentan-1-one" not in deduced_compound_A:
        return f"Failed to identify Compound A correctly. The Wittig reaction hint points to a cyclopentanone derivative, but the logic failed."

    # Step 2.2: Trace the reaction sequence from A to E.
    # A (ketone) + HCN -> B (cyanohydrin)
    # B + H2/Pd -> C (reduction of nitrile to primary amine, 1-aminomethyl-cycloalkanol)
    # C + HNO2 -> D (diazotization) -> E (rearrangement)
    # This specific sequence (1-aminomethyl-cycloalkanol + HNO2) is a Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement.
    # The key outcome of this rearrangement is a one-carbon ring expansion.
    
    # Step 2.3: Determine the structure of Compound E.
    # Since Compound A is a cyclopentanone (5-membered ring), Compound E must be a cyclohexanone (6-membered ring).
    # The substituents (methyl groups) are not involved in the rearrangement and retain their relative positions.
    # Therefore, '3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one' becomes '3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one'.
    deduced_compound_E = "3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one"

    # Step 2.4: Verify with Hint (b) for Compound E.
    # IR of E is ~1715 cm^-1. This is characteristic of a less-strained 6-membered ring ketone (cyclohexanone).
    # This confirms the ring expansion from a 5-membered ring (~1750 cm^-1) to a 6-membered ring (~1715 cm^-1).
