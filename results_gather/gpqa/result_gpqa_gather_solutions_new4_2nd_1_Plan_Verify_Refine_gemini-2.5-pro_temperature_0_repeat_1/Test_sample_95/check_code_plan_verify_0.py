    This function verifies the calculation for the entropy of the supermassive black hole.
    It follows these steps:
    1. Defines the given values and physical constants.
    2. Converts units to SI.
    3. Calculates the event horizon radius, correctly handling the diameter vs. radius distinction.
    4. Calculates the event horizon area.
    5. Calculates the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
    6. Compares the calculated order of magnitude with the chosen answer's order of magnitude.
