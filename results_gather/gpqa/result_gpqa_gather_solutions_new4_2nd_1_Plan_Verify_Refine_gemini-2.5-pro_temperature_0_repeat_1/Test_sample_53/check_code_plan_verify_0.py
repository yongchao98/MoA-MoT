    # The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.
    # The numbering C1=C2-C3(Me)-C4(Me)-C5(iPr)-C6 is fixed by IUPAC rules.
    # "Unzipping" the ring at the C1=C2 bond gives a linear chain based on the
    # connectivity C2-C3-C4-C5-C6-C1.
    # The precursor structure is: CH2=CH-[from C2]-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-CH(iPr)-CH2-CH=CH2
    
    # --- Step 3: Determine the IUPAC name of the precursor ---
    # The parent chain is octa-1,7-diene.
    # We must number it to give the substituents the lowest locants.
    # Numbering from left: C1=C2-C3(Me)-C4(Me)-C5(iPr)-C6-C7=C8. Locants are {3, 4, 5}.
    # Numbering from right: C8=C7-C6-C5(iPr)-C4(Me)-C3(Me)-C2=C1. Locants are {4, 5, 6}.
    # The lowest locant set is {3, 4, 5}. So, numbering must be from the left.
    # The substituents are 3-methyl, 4-methyl, and 5-isopropyl.
    # Alphabetizing gives the name: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.
