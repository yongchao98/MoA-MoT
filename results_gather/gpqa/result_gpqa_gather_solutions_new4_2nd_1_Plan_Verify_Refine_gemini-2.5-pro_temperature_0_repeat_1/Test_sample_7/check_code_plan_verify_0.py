    Checks the correctness of the genetic analysis based on experimental data.
    
    The function verifies the following conclusions from the data:
    1. G2 is the upstream transcription factor due to epistasis over G1 and G3.
    2. G1 and G3 have a redundant relationship due to a synergistic interaction.
    3. There is no epistasis between G1 and G3.
