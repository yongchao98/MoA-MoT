    # --- Analysis of Reaction A ---
    # Starting Material: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol
    # Structure: Et-C3(OH)(Me) - C4(OH)(Ph)-Et
    
    # Step 1: Determine the most stable carbocation.
    # Cation at C3: Tertiary alkyl.
    # Cation at C4: Tertiary benzylic (stabilized by Phenyl ring).
    # Conclusion: Cation at C4 is more stable.
    
    # Step 2: Determine the migrating group.
    # With the cation at C4, a group from the adjacent C3 migrates.
    # Groups on C3: Methyl, Ethyl.
    # Migratory aptitude: Ethyl > Methyl.
    # Conclusion: The Ethyl group migrates.
    
    # Step 3: Determine the final product.
    # The Ethyl group migrates from C3 to C4. The positive charge shifts to C3.
    # The OH on C3 forms a ketone.
    # The resulting structure is CH3-C(=O)-C(Ph)(Et)2.
    # IUPAC Naming: The longest carbon chain containing the ketone is a pentan-2-one.
    # At position 3, there is an ethyl group and a phenyl group.
    # Name: 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one
    product_A = "3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one"

    # --- Analysis of Reaction B ---
    # Starting Material: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol
    # Structure: Me-C2(OH)(Ph) - C3(OH)(p-HO-Ph)-Et
    
    # Step 1: Determine the most stable carbocation.
    # Cation at C2: Tertiary, stabilized by a Phenyl group.
    # Cation at C3: Tertiary, stabilized by a 4-hydroxyphenyl group.
    # The -OH on the 4-hydroxyphenyl ring is a strong electron-donating group,
    # making it a much better stabilizer than a plain Phenyl group.
    # Conclusion: Cation at C3 is more stable.
    
    # Step 2: Determine the migrating group.
    # With the cation at C3, a group from the adjacent C2 migrates.
    # Groups on C2: Methyl, Phenyl.
    # Migratory aptitude: Phenyl > Methyl.
    # Conclusion: The Phenyl group migrates.
    
    # Step 3: Determine the final product.
    # The Phenyl group migrates from C2 to C3. The positive charge shifts to C2.
    # The OH on C2 forms a ketone.
    # Name: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one
    product_B = "3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one"

    # --- Analysis of Reaction C ---
    # Starting Material: 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1,2-diol
    # Let ArOMe = 4-methoxyphenyl. Structure: (ArOMe)2-C1(OH) - C2(OH)(ArOMe)(Ph)
    
    # Step 1: Determine the most stable carbocation.
    # Cation at C1: Stabilized by two strongly electron-donating ArOMe groups.
    # Cation at C2: Stabilized by one ArOMe group and one Phenyl group.
    # Conclusion: Cation at C1 is significantly more stable.
    
    # Step 2: Determine the migrating group.
    # With the cation at C1, a group from the adjacent C2 migrates.
    # Groups on C2: ArOMe, Phenyl.
    # The ArOMe group is more electron-rich and has a higher migratory aptitude.
    # Conclusion: The ArOMe group migrates.
    
    # Step 3: Determine the final product.
    # The ArOMe group migrates from C2 to C1. The positive charge shifts to C2.
    # The OH on C2 forms a ketone.
    # Structure: (ArOMe)3-C - C(=O)-Ph
    # Name: 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one
