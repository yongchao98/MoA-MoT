def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the radioactive decay problem.

    The problem states:
    - Decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%.
    - 50 minutes have passed without decay.
    - What is the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes?

    The core principle is that radioactive decay is a "memoryless" process.
    This means the 50 minutes that have passed are irrelevant. The problem
    is to find the decay probability for a 150-minute interval.

    Let P(t) be the decay probability in time t, and S(t) be the survival probability.
    P(t) = 1 - S(t)
    S(t) = exp(-lambda * t)

    Given: P(100) = 0.32
    This means S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.

    We need to find P(150) = 1 - S(150).
    S(150) = exp(-lambda * 150)
           = exp(-lambda * 100 * 1.5)
           = (exp(-lambda * 100))^1.5
           = S(100)^1.5
           = 0.68^1.5

    So, P(150) = 1 - (0.68^1.5)
