    # --- Problem Setup ---
    # Given: Decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%
    p_decay_100 = 0.32
    
    # The fact that 50 minutes have passed is irrelevant due to the memoryless property of exponential decay.
    # We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which is equivalent to finding the
    # probability of decay in a 150-minute interval for a new atom.
    
    # --- Calculation ---
    # The probability of survival S(t) is given by S(t) = exp(-lambda * t)
    # The probability of decay P(t) is P(t) = 1 - S(t)
    
    # From the given data, the survival probability for 100 minutes is:
    s_survival_100 = 1 - p_decay_100
    # s_survival_100 = exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68
    
    # We need to find the decay probability for 150 minutes, P(150) = 1 - S(150)
    # S(150) = exp(-lambda * 150)
    # We can write S(150) in terms of S(100):
    # S(150) = exp(-lambda * 100 * 1.5) = (exp(-lambda * 100))^1.5
    # S(150) = S(100)^1.5
    
    s_survival_150 = s_survival_100 ** 1.5
    
    # The decay probability for 150 minutes is:
    p_decay_150 = 1 - s_survival_150
    
    calculated_prob_percent = p_decay_150 * 100
