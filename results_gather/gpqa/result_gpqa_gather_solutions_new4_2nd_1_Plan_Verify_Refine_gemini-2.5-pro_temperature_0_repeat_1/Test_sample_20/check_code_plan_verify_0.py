    Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.

    ### **Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**

    The goal is to identify which compound, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism.

    *   **Careful Point:** The key concept is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit this, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen). This hydrogen is then able to move to the carbonyl oxygen, forming an enol (a C=C-OH group).

    1.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**
        *   **Structure:** It has a six-membered ring with two ketone (C=O) groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds.
        *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are themselves part of the double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.
        *   **Conclusion:** Since benzoquinone lacks the necessary α-hydrogens, it **cannot** undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

    2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**
        *   **Structure:** It has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons between the ketones (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups.
        *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These carbons are sp³ hybridized and have hydrogens. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.
        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these acidic α-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerization. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is exceptionally stable due to being aromatic. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.

    **Decision for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

    ---

    ### **Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**

    The goal is to identify which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, **will** show optical isomerism.

    *   **Careful Point:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

    1.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**
        *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.
        *   **Chiral Center Check:** The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:
            1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)
            2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)
            3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)
            4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)
        *   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.

    2.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**
        *   **Structure:** CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ (the *trans* isomer).
        *   **Chirality Check:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. Any molecule with a center of symmetry or a plane of symmetry is achiral. It has no chiral centers.
        *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **will not** show optical isomerism.

    **Decision for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

    ### **Final Conclusion**

    *   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.
    *   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.
