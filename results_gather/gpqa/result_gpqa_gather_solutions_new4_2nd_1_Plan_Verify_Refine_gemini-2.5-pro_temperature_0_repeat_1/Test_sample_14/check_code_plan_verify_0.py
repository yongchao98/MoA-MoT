    # Step 1: Define the relationships from the problem statement.
    # Let P1, Ms1, Rs1, a1 be properties for Planet_1 system.
    # Let P2, Ms2, Rs2, a2 be properties for Planet_2 system.
    # P2 = 3 * P1
    # Ms1 = 2 * Ms2
    # Rs1 = Rs2

    # Step 2: Formulate the ratio of transit probabilities.
    # p_tr = Rs / a
    # p1 / p2 = (Rs1 / a1) / (Rs2 / a2)
    # Since Rs1 = Rs2, this simplifies to:
    # p1 / p2 = a2 / a1

    # Step 3: Use Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of semi-major axes.
    # P^2 is proportional to a^3 / Ms
    # a^3 is proportional to P^2 * Ms
    # a is proportional to (P^2 * Ms)^(1/3)
    # So, a2 / a1 = [ (P2^2 * Ms2) / (P1^2 * Ms1) ]^(1/3)

    # Step 4: Substitute the given relationships into the formula.
    # a2 / a1 = [ ((3 * P1)^2 * Ms2) / (P1^2 * (2 * Ms2)) ]^(1/3)
    # a2 / a1 = [ (9 * P1^2 * Ms2) / (2 * P1^2 * Ms2) ]^(1/3)

    # Step 5: Simplify and calculate the ratio.
    # The P1^2 and Ms2 terms cancel out.
    # a2 / a1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)
