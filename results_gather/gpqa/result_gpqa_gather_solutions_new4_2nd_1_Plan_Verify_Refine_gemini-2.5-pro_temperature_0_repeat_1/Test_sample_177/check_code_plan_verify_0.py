    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the physics question.

    The question asks for the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ in the Lagrangian
    L_int = κ * ψ_bar * σ_μν * ψ * F^μν and whether the theory is renormalizable.

    The provided answer is D: [κ]_M = -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

    The function will perform the dimensional analysis step-by-step and check if the
    conclusion matches the provided answer.
