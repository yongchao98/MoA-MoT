    # This pathway is considered more chemically sound for the given harsh reaction conditions,
    # despite the NMR data for Product 1 being a likely red herring.
    # Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane -> protoadamantan-4-one (ketone)
    # Step 2: protoadamantan-4-one -> protoadamant-4-ene (alkene via reduction & dehydration)
    # Step 3: Ozonolysis of protoadamant-4-ene.
