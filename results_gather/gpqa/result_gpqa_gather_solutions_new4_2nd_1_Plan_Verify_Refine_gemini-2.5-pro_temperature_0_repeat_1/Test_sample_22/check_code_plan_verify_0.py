def check_organic_chemistry_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the organic chemistry question.

    The check is based on verifying the logical steps of the reaction mechanism:
    1.  The reaction starts with protonation of the alkene, following Markovnikov's rule, to form a secondary carbocation.
    2.  This intermediate can follow two competing pathways:
        a) Direct intramolecular cyclization (Friedel-Crafts alkylation) to form a 6-membered ring.
        b) A 1,2-methyl shift to form a more stable tertiary carbocation, followed by intramolecular cyclization to form a 5-membered ring.
    3.  The code identifies the products from these two pathways.
    4.  It then checks if the LLM's chosen option contains exactly these two products.
