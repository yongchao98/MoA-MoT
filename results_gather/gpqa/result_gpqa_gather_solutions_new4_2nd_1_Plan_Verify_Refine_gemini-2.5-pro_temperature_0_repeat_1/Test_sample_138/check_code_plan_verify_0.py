def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to a chemistry question.

    The question asks to identify the starting materials (A and B) for two separate reactions
    that produce specific diketones using the reagent system (NaNO2, HCl, H2O).

    The chemical principles used for verification are:
    1. The reagent system (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) performs Î±-oxidation on ketones. This reaction
       converts a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a carbonyl group into a new carbonyl group.
    2. Constraint 1: The starting material must be a ketone (typically ending in "-one").
       Alcohols ("-ol") or diols ("-diol") are incorrect substrates for this specific transformation.
    3. Constraint 2: The starting ketone must have the correct carbon skeleton and a carbonyl group
       positioned such that oxidation of an adjacent methylene group yields the specified product.

    # For Reaction A:
    # To produce the 1,2-diketone "4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione", the reaction must start
    # with a 1-ketone and oxidize the adjacent C2 position.
    # Therefore, the required starting material A is "4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one".

    # To produce the 2,3-diketone "5-methylhexane-2,3-dione", the reaction must start
    # with a ketone where an adjacent methylene group can be oxidized.
    # Starting with "5-methylhexan-2-one", the carbonyl is at C2. The adjacent C3 is a
    # methylene group, which upon oxidation yields the correct product.
