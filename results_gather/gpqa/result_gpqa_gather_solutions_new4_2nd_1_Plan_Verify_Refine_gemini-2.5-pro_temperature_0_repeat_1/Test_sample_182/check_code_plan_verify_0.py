def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided LLM answer for the chemistry question.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  **Analyze the Starting Material**: Determine the features of "2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid" that contribute to its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).
        - A ring structure contributes 1 to IHD.
        - Each pi bond (C=C or C=O) contributes 1 to IHD.
    2.  **Analyze the Reaction**: The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI is a complete reduction. It reduces all pi bonds to single bonds but does not break the stable ring structure.
    3.  **Calculate the Product's IHD**: Based on the reaction, calculate the IHD of the final product.
    4.  **Compare with LLM's Answer**: Check if the LLM's chosen option corresponds to the correctly calculated IHD.
