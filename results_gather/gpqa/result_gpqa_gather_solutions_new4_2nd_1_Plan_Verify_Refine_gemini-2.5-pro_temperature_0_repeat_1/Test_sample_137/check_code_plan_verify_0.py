    # acid-catalyzed (i.e., its rate depends on H+ concentration).
    # Principle 2: The pH increased from 1 to 4, meaning the H+ concentration
    # decreased by a factor of 1000 (10^(4-1)).
    # Conclusion: A drastic decrease in the concentration of a catalyst will cause a
    # significant decrease in the reaction rate. This is a very strong explanation.
