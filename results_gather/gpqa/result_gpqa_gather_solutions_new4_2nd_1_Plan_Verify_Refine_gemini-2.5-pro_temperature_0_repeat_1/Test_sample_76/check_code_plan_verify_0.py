    # --- Step 1: Analyze Reaction A ---
    # The reaction is a Wittig rearrangement. The strong base (BuLi) deprotonates the benzylic carbon.
    # The resulting carbanion undergoes a sigmatropic rearrangement.
    # The [2,3]-shift is sterically hindered, so the [1,2]-shift is the major pathway.
    # This leads to a secondary alcohol: 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol (accepting a likely typo in the name).
    # The other option, (Z)-2-methyl-5-phenylpent-2-en-1-ol, is a primary alcohol with a different skeleton and is mechanistically incorrect.
