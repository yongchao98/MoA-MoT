    # --- Step 1: Independent Calculation of the Correct Answer ---

    # The problem involves 4 identical spin-1/2 particles (fermions).
    # The energy of a single particle in level n is E_n = n^2 * E.
    # By the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level 'n' can hold at most two particles.

    # We model this by creating a pool of available single-particle states.
    # Each 'n' value appears twice to account for spin-up and spin-down states.
    # A sufficiently large pool is needed to find the first few excited states.
    # Levels up to n=7 are more than enough to be certain of the lowest states.

    # `itertools.combinations` ensures we choose 4 distinct states, upholding the Pauli principle.
    possible_configurations = itertools.combinations(level_pool, 4)

    # Calculate the total energy for each configuration and store the unique energy values.
    unique_total_energies = set()
    for config in possible_configurations:
        # config is a tuple of the 'n' values for the 4 chosen particles, e.g., (1, 1, 2, 2)
        total_energy = sum(n**2 for n in config)
        unique_total_energies.add(total_energy)

    # Sort the unique energies to find the ground state, 1st excited, 2nd excited, etc.
    sorted_energies = sorted(list(unique_total_energies))

    # The first three energies from our calculation are the correct ones.
    calculated_energies = sorted_energies[:3]

    # --- Step 2: Verification against the provided answer ---

    # The provided answer calculates the energies to be 10E, 15E, and 18E, and selects option A.

    # Check 1: Does the reasoning in the answer produce the correct numerical values?

        return (f"Incorrect. The answer's reasoning leads to energies {answer_reasoning_energies[0]}E, {answer_reasoning_energies[1]}E, {answer_reasoning_energies[2]}E, "
