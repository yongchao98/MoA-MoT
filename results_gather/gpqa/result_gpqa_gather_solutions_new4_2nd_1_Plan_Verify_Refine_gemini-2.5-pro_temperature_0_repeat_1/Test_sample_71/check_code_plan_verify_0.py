Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers to determine the most chemically sound conclusion.

### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence

1.  **Step 1: Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**
    *   **Careful Point (Diene Identity):** The first step involves generating a reactive diene from "5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene" and NaI. As many candidate answers correctly point out (e.g., Answers 1, 4, 7, 17), this unusual name is very likely a misnomer or a complex precursor for the much more common reactive intermediate **o-quinodimethane** (also known as o-xylylene). This interpretation assumes the intended precursor was a standard one like 1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene, which is a classic route to this diene. This is a more plausible scenario for a well-designed chemistry problem than taking the unusual name literally.
    *   **Careful Point (Stoichiometry):** The reaction uses 2 equivalents of the diene precursor with the dienophile, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. This stoichiometry, combined with the fact that the dienophile has two double bonds, strongly indicates a **double Diels-Alder reaction**. Two molecules of o-quinodimethane add across the two double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative to form a large, symmetric bis-adduct, **Product 1**.

2.  **Step 2: Deprotection (Ether Hydrolysis)**
    *   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. This is a standard procedure for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) at the C7 bridge is converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming **Product 2**. This step is straightforward and agreed upon by all credible analyses.

3.  **Step 3: Oxidation**
    *   Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This is the **Parikh-Doering oxidation**, a mild method to convert the secondary alcohol at C7 into a ketone (C=O). This forms **Product 3**. This step is also straightforward.

4.  **Step 4: Thermal Fragmentation and Final Product Formation**
    *   **Careful Point (Reaction Type):** Product 3, the double Diels-Alder adduct, is heated to 150°C. This induces a **double retro-Diels-Alder reaction**, causing the molecule to fragment.
    *   **Careful Point (Fragments):** The fragmentation releases the constituent parts:
        1.  One molecule of the central core: **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**. This molecule is known to be thermally unstable and rapidly undergoes a cheletropic elimination, extruding a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the highly stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**.
        2.  Two molecules of the diene: **o-quinodimethane**.
    *   **Careful Point (Fate of the Diene):** This is the most critical step for determining the final product. o-quinodimethane is extremely reactive and cannot be isolated.
        *   *Incorrect Pathway:* Several answers suggest it tautomerizes to o-xylene. This is chemically impossible as o-quinodimethane is C₈H₈ while o-xylene is C₈H₁₀. This invalidates the reasoning in answers like 6, 11, and 16.
        *   *Correct Pathway:* When generated at high temperature and concentration (as two molecules are released from one), the most favorable reaction is **dimerization**. The major thermal dimerization product of o-quinodimethane is **dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctadiene**, formed via a [4+4] cycloaddition. This stable C₁₆H₁₆ molecule is the logical candidate for the "final product 4". This is the conclusion reached by the most rigorous analyses (e.g., Answers 1, 4, 8, 17).

### Analysis of Final Product 4: Dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctadiene

*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The final product is dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctadiene. This molecule is not planar and adopts a stable, puckered conformation (often described as a "tub" or "twist-boat"). This puckered structure possesses **C₂ symmetry**. A C₂ axis of rotation passes through the center of the molecule, relating the two halves.
*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:** The C₂ symmetry determines which hydrogen atoms are chemically equivalent.
    1.  **Aromatic Hydrogens:** There are 8 aromatic protons on two benzene rings. The C₂ axis makes the two rings equivalent. However, within a single benzene ring, none of the four protons are related by any symmetry element. Therefore, there are **4 distinct types of aromatic protons**.
    2.  **Aliphatic (Benzylic) Hydrogens:** There are 8 aliphatic protons in the central eight-membered ring, existing as four -CH₂- groups. The C₂ axis relates these CH₂ groups in pairs (two non-equivalent types of CH₂ groups). Within each CH₂ group, the two geminal protons are diastereotopic (not equivalent) because they exist in a chiral environment. This results in **4 distinct types of aliphatic protons**.
*   **Total Count:** The total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is the sum of the distinct aromatic and aliphatic types: 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = **8**.

This corresponds to option B.
