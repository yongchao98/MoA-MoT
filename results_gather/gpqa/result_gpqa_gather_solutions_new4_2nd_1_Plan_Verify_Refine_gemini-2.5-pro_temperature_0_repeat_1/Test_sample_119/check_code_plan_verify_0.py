    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by performing a symbolic derivation.
    
    The derivation follows these steps:
    1. Define the relationship between distance (d) and parallax (plx): d = k/plx.
    2. Define the cumulative number of stars (N) with parallax >= plx. This is the number
       of stars within a sphere of radius d, so N is proportional to d^3.
    3. Express N in terms of plx: N ‚àù (1/plx)^3 = plx^-3.
    4. The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the
       derivative dN/d(plx).
    5. Differentiate N with respect to plx to find the proportionality.
    6. Compare the resulting exponent with the exponent from the chosen answer option.
