    """
    This function checks the correctness of the calculated non-Gaussianity (nG)
    for a specific Schrödinger cat state.

    The calculation follows these steps:
    1. The non-Gaussianity (nG) for a pure state simplifies to the von Neumann
       entropy of a reference Gaussian state, nG = S(tau).
    2. The reference state tau has the same first and second moments as the
       original state rho. For the given parameters (phi=-pi/4, alpha=0.5),
       the state is an "odd cat state".
    3. The first moment <a> is 0. The second moments are <a^2> = alpha^2 and
       <n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2).
    4. The entropy S(tau) is calculated from the symplectic eigenvalue nu, where
       nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2.
    5. The entropy formula is S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2).
