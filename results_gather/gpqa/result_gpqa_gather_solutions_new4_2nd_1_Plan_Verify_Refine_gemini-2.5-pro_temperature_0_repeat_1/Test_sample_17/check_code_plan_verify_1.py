    # The notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y)_star - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun
    # A key property is [A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]

    # Step 1: Calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance for Star 1, [Si/H]_1
    # [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1
    Si_H_1 = Si_Fe_1 + Fe_H_1

    # Step 2: Calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance for Star 2, [Si/H]_2
    # The relation is [Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2
    # Rearranging to solve for [Si/H]_2:
    # [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2
    Si_H_2 = Mg_H_2 - Mg_Si_2

    # Step 3: Calculate the logarithm of the ratio of silicon atoms.
    # The ratio R is (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2
    # log10(R) = log10((n_Si/n_H)_1) - log10((n_Si/n_H)_2)
    # This simplifies to: log10(R) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2

    # Check if the calculated ratio is approximately equal to the LLM's answer value.
    # A relative tolerance of 5% is reasonable given the "~" in the options.
