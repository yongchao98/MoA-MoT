def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided LLM answer by recalculating the result from the problem statement.

    The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, which is interpreted as the ratio of their silicon abundance fractions: (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2.

    The calculation follows these steps:
    1.  Determine the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance [Si/H] for Star 1 using the formula: [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1.
    2.  Determine the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance [Si/H] for Star 2 by rearranging the formula [Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2.
    3.  Calculate the logarithm of the final ratio: log10(Ratio) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2.
    4.  Convert the logarithmic ratio to a linear ratio: Ratio = 10^log10(Ratio).
    5.  Compare the calculated ratio with the value corresponding to the selected option 'D'.
