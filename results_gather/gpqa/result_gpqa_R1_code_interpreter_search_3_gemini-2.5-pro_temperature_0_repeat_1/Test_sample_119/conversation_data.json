    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental quantities:**\n    *   **Uniform star distribution:** This means the number density of stars, denoted by `ρ`, is constant everywhere in space. `ρ = Number of stars / Volume`.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The relationship is `plx = 1/d` (when using standard astronomical units of parsecs for distance and arcseconds for parallax). This can be rewritten as `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Goal:** We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which can be written as `dN/d(plx)`, changes with `plx`.\n\n2.  **Consider the number of stars in a spherical shell:**\n    *   Let's think about the stars located in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from the observer, with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness.\n    *   Surface area of a sphere of radius `d` is `4πd²`.\n    *   So, the volume of the shell is `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in this shell:**\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) in this shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell.\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n\n4.  **Translate from distance (`d`, `dd`) to parallax (`plx`, `d(plx)`):**\n    *   We have the relationships `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to relate the thickness of the shell `dd` to the corresponding interval in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   `d = plx⁻¹`\n    *   `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (plx⁻¹) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign just indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. For calculating the number of stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we can write `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n5.  **Substitute the parallax expressions back into the equation for `dN`:**\n    *   We start with `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)` (ignoring the negative sign as we are dealing with counts).\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Combine the terms:\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit parallax range, which is `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From the equation above, we can divide both sides by `d(plx)`:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Determine the proportionality:**\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the relationship:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Premise:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere. The number density is the number of stars per unit volume.\n\n2.  **Relate Number of Stars to Volume:** We want to find the number of stars within a specific range of distances, which corresponds to a specific range of parallaxes. Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer.\n    *   Let the inner radius of the shell be `d`.\n    *   Let the thickness of the shell be a very small amount, `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) can be approximated by its surface area multiplied by its thickness.\n    *   Surface Area of a sphere of radius `d` = `4πd²`.\n    *   Volume of the shell, `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Stars in the Shell:** Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) in this thin shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV`\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n4.  **Introduce Parallax:** The parallax (`plx`) is defined as the inverse of the distance (`d`) when `d` is measured in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds.\n    *   `plx = 1/d`  or  `d = 1/plx`\n\n5.  **Convert from Distance (`d`, `dd`) to Parallax (`plx`, `d(plx)`):** We need to express our equation for `dN` in terms of parallax. We have a term for `d`, and now we need to find the equivalent for the shell thickness `dd`. We can do this by differentiating the distance-parallax relationship:\n    *   `d = 1/plx = plx⁻¹`\n    *   Taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us the relationship between the small thickness `dd` and the small parallax range `d(plx)`:\n        `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. For counting stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we can ignore the negative sign: `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n6.  **Substitute Parallax into the Star Count Equation:** Now we substitute our expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    *   Original equation: `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Simplify and Find the Final Relationship:** Combine the terms to simplify the expression.\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    *   The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by dividing both sides of our equation by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (4πρ) / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the relationship is:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>",

We need to substitute the parallax relationships into the equation.\n    *   First, substitute `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   Next, we need to find what `dd` is in terms of `plx`.
