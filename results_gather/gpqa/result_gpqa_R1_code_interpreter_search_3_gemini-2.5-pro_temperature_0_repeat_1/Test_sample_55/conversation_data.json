    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Process\nThe problem describes a two-step decay process in a hydrogen atom, from the initial state |n,l,m> = |3,0,0> to the final state |1,0,0>. The decay occurs via \"two dipole transitions\". This means there must be an intermediate state, and each step of the transition must obey the electric dipole selection rules.\n\n### 2. Apply Dipole Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, Δn, can be any integer, but for emission (decay), the energy must decrease, so n must decrease.\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl, must be ±1. (Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1).\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm, must be 0 or ±1. (Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1).\n\n### 3. Determine the Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be |n', l', m'>.\n\n**First Transition: |3,0,0> → |n',l',m'>**\n*   **Applying the Δl rule:** The initial state has l=0. Therefore, for the intermediate state, l' must satisfy l' - 0 = ±1. Since l must be non-negative, we must have **l' = 1**.\n*   **Applying the Δn rule:** The initial state has n=3. For a decay, n' must be less than 3. The final state is n=1, so the intermediate state must have n' > 1. The only possibility is **n' = 2**.\n*   **Applying the Δm rule:** The initial state has m=0. Therefore, for the intermediate state, m' must satisfy m' - 0 = 0, ±1. So, **m' can be -1, 0, or +1**.\n\nCombining these, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n**Second Transition: |n',l',m'> → |1,0,0>**\nLet's check if the intermediate states we found can decay to the final state |1,0,0>.\n*   **Intermediate state |2,1,m'>:**\n    *   **Δl:** The final state has l=0. The intermediate state has l'=1. So, Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the Δl=±1 rule.\n    *   **Δm:** The final state has m=0. The intermediate state has m'. So, Δm = 0 - m'. This is allowed as long as m' is -1, 0, or 1, which it is.\n    *   **Δn:** The final state has n=1, and the intermediate state has n'=2. This is an allowed decay (n decreases).\n\nSo, all three routes are physically possible:\n1.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n2.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n3.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This corresponds to the branching ratio of that decay channel. The total probability for the cascade is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n**Probability of the second step:**\nThe second step is the decay from a 2p state (|2,1,m'>) to the 1s state (|1,0,0>). The 2p state can only decay to the 1s state via a dipole transition (n=1 is the only lower energy level, and for n=1, l must be 0). There are no other allowed decay channels. Therefore, the branching ratio for the second step, P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>), is 1 for all three intermediate states.\n\n**Probability of the first step:**\nThe overall probability of each route is therefore determined entirely by the branching ratio of the first step: P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>). We need to find the relative probabilities of decaying into the m'=-1, 0, and +1 states.\n\nThe transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, |<n',l',m'| **d** |n,l,m>|².\nThe initial state |3,0,0> is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred direction in space. Because of this symmetry, the atom is equally likely to emit a photon corresponding to any of the three possible Δm transitions.\n*   The transition to |2,1,0> (Δm=0) corresponds to emitting a photon polarized along the z-axis.\n*   The transitions to |2,1,±1> (Δm=±1) correspond to emitting circularly polarized photons in the x-y plane.\n\nSince the initial state has no preferred orientation, the probabilities for these three outcomes must be equal.\nLet P be the probability for one such transition. Then:\nP(m'=-1) + P(m'=0) + P(m'=+1) = 1\nP + P + P = 1\n3P = 1\nP = 1/3\n\nSo, the branching ratio for the transition to any specific m' state is 1/3.\n*   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n*   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n*   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n\n### 5. Determine the Final Answer\nNow we can find the total probability for each of the three possible routes:\n*   **Route 1:** P = P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>) × P(|2,1,1>→|1,0,0>) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n    The route is |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> with probability 1/3.\n*   **Route 2:** P = P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>) × P(|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n    The route is |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> with probability 1/3.\n*   **Route 3:** P = P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>) × P(|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0>) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n    The route is |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> with probability 1/3.\n\nNow, we compare these results with the given options:\nA) |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\nB) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 2/3 (Incorrect probability)\nC) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 1/3 (Correct route and probability)\nD) |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only option that matches our calculation is C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants to find the correct decay route and probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the constraints of the process.\nThe process is a two-step decay involving electric dipole transitions. This means we need to find an intermediate state, let's call it |n', l', m'>, such that both transitions, |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'> and |n', l', m'> → |1,0,0>, are allowed by the electric dipole selection rules.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the electric dipole selection rules.\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole (E1) transition are:\n1.  **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly one.\n2.  **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by zero or one.\n3.  **Δn = any integer**: The principal quantum number can change by any integer. For a decay (emission), the energy must decrease, so n must decrease.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the possible intermediate state(s) |n', l', m'>.\n\n**Transition 1: |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'>**\n*   **Initial state:** n=3, l=0, m=0.\n*   **Applying Δl = ±1:** Since l=0, the final orbital quantum number l' must be 1.\n*   **Applying Δn < 0:** Since n=3, the principal quantum number n' must be less than 3. The final state of the whole process is n=1, so the intermediate state must have n' > 1. This leaves **n' = 2**.\n*   **Applying Δm = 0, ±1:** Since m=0, the final magnetic quantum number m' can be 0, +1, or -1.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,-1>. These are the three sub-levels of the 2p state.\n\n**Transition 2: |n', l', m'> → |1,0,0>**\nLet's check if our possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0>.\n*   **Intermediate state:** |2,1,m'> (where m' = -1, 0, or 1).\n*   **Final state:** |1,0,0>.\n*   **Checking Δl:** Δl = l_final - l_intermediate = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the Δl = ±1 rule.\n*   **Checking Δm:** Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m'. This is allowed since m' can be -1, 0, or 1.\n*   **Checking Δn:** Δn = n_final - n_intermediate = 1 - 2 = -1. This is an allowed decay.\n\nConclusion: All three states |2,1,1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,-1> are valid intermediate states. The possible decay routes are:\n*   |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n*   |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n*   |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n\nAll routes listed in the options are physically possible. We must now determine the probability.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the probability (branching ratio) for a specific route.\nThe total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step:\nP_total = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) × P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>)\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>).\n    The 2p state (|2,1,m'>) is an excited state that can decay to the 1s state (|1,0,0>) via an allowed dipole transition. Since 1s is the only lower energy state, the 2p state will decay to the 1s state with a probability of 1 (or a branching ratio of 100%).\n    So, P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) = 1.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step:** P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>).\n    This is the branching ratio for the decay from the 3s state to one of the three 2p sub-levels. The initial state |3,0,0> is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate sub-levels |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1>.\n    The sum of the probabilities for all possible decay channels must be 1.\n    P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>) + P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>) + P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>) = 1\n    Since the probabilities are equal, let's call them P_m':\n    P_m' + P_m' + P_m' = 1\n    3 × P_m' = 1\n    P_m' = 1/3\n\n    So, the probability of decaying into any specific m' state is 1/3.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The total probability for any of the three routes is:\n    P_total = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the given options.\n*   A) |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Process\nThe problem describes a two-step decay process in a hydrogen atom. The atom starts in the initial state |n,l,m⟩ = |3,0,0⟩ and ends in the final state |1,0,0⟩. The decay occurs via \"two dipole transitions,\" which means there must be an intermediate state, and each of the two transitions must obey the electric dipole selection rules.\n\nThe process can be written as:\n|3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n### 2. Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole (E1) transition are:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by zero or one.\n*   **Δn = any integer**: For a decay (emission), the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number `n` must decrease.\n\n### 3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Process and Governing Rules\nThe problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state to a final state. The key constraint is that both steps are \"dipole transitions.\" This means each step must individually obey the electric dipole (E1) selection rules.\n\nThe process is a cascade decay:\nInitial State → Intermediate State → Final State\n|3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\nThe E1 selection rules are:\n*   **Δl = ±1** (The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly one).\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1** (The magnetic quantum number can change by zero or one).\n*   **Δn = any integer** (For a decay process, energy must be released, so the principal quantum number `n` must decrease).\n\n### 2. Determine the Intermediate State |n',l',m'⟩\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions to find the quantum numbers of the intermediate state.\n\n**Step A: First Transition |3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩**\n*   **Initial State:** n=3, l=0, m=0.\n*   **Rule for l:** Since the initial `l` is 0, and Δl must be ±1, the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n*   **Rule for n:** For a decay, `n` must decrease, so **n' < 3**.\n*   **Rule for m:** Since the initial `m` is 0, and Δm can be 0, ±1, the intermediate state can have **m' = -1, 0, or +1**.\n\n**Step B: Second Transition |n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n*   **Final State:** n=1, l=0, m=0.\n*   **Rule for l:** The intermediate state has l'=1 (from Step A), and the final state has l=0.

The deciding factor is the probability.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each individual step.\n\n**Probability(Route) = P(Step 1) × P(Step 2)**\n\n*   **Probability of the second step, P(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩):**\n    The 2p state (|2,1,m'⟩) is an excited state. The only state with lower energy is the 1s ground state (|1,0,0⟩). The transition 2p → 1s is an allowed dipole transition. Since there are no other lower-energy states to decay to, the probability of this transition occurring is 1 (i.e., the branching ratio is 100%).\n\n*   **Probability of the first step, P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩):**\n    The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, the three possible final states for this step—|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩—are degenerate (have the same energy). Because the initial state is symmetric, the probability of decaying into any of these three sublevels is equal.\n    The sum of the probabilities for all possible outcomes must be 1.\n    P(to m'=-1) + P(to m'=0) + P(to m'=+1) = 1\n    Since the probabilities are equal, let's call the probability for one specific channel `P`:\n    P + P + P = 1\n    3P = 1\n    P = 1/3\n\n    So, the probability of the atom decaying from the 3s state to any *specific* 2p sublevel (e.g., |2,1,0⟩) is 1/3.\n\n*   **Total Probability for a specific route:**\n    Let's calculate the probability for the route given in option C: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.\n    Probability = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\n    Probability = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nEach of the three possible decay routes has a total probability of 1/3. We now check the options against this result.\n\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. (Incorrect probability)\n*   C) **|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3.** (This matches our calculation).\n*   D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
