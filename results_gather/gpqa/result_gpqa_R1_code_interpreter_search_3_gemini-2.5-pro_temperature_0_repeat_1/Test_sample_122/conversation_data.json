    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S). This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S'). This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the proper time, often denoted as `Δt₀`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this distance `d`. The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (S).\n\n4.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    *   Special relativity tells us that time passes differently in different inertial frames. An observer in the stationary frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the time interval measured in the moving frame (`Δt'`). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The formula for time dilation is: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   First, let's find the ratio `v/c`. The speed of light `c` is approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n        *   `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        *   `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   Now we can use the distance formula `d = v * Δt`.\n        *   `d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    *   Let's compute the final value.\n\nTo get a precise result, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # s (time in ejecta's frame)\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate time in the Galaxy's frame (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d)\nd = v * dt\n\nprint(d)\n```\n<execute_output>\n3061862.1784789724\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.

This is the \"proper time\" because it's the time measured in the frame where the clock (the ejecta itself) is at rest.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` that the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n    *   The formula for this distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time interval measured in the Galaxy's frame (S).\n\n3.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    *   According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) compared to the time interval (`Δt'`) measured in a moving frame (S').
