    "An optically active compound must be chiral and not a racemate. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).

    "A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and is not present as a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key indicators of chirality are the presence of stereocenters and the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.

This indicates the presence of stereocenters and specifies a single, particular stereoisomer. The existence of a single enantiomer of a complex, chiral molecule means it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetrical, meaning the substituents on C2 are identical to those on C3. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a meso compound, which has an internal plane of symmetry despite containing stereocenters. Meso compounds are achiral and thus **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` isomers are a pair of enantiomers. They lack an internal plane of symmetry and are chiral.

Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter, making the molecule chiral. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all cis). This arrangement gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry, including three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H group. Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`. To check for chirality, we look for stereocenters. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The carbon in the `CH(CH₃)₂` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups.
