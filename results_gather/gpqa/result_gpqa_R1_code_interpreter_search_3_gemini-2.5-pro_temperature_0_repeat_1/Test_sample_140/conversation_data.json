    "This problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate via an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\n**1. Identify Reactants and Conditions:**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (a heavy isotope of hydrogen, D) at position 2. The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have regular hydrogen atoms (H).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is a very strong base, and the amide ion (:NH₂⁻) is the active species.\n\n**2. Mechanism Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne)**\nThe reaction starts with the abstraction of a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium (D) atom.\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\nThe strong base, :NH₂⁻, can abstract a proton from either of these positions, leading to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion (:NH₂⁻) removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C6.\n    3.  The lone pair on the C6 carbanion attacks C1, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) leaves.\n    4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    ```\n       Br                    -Br-\n      /  \\                  ----->       (triple bond C1-C6)\n    (D)C--C(H)  + :NH2-                 /  \\\n    ||  ||      <-----               (D)C--C\n   (H)C--C(H)     H-NH2                ||  ||\n      \\  /                             (H)C--C\n       C                                  \\  /\n       |                                   C\n      (H)                                  |\n                                          (H)\n    (H at C6 abstracted)              (3-deuterobenzyne)\n    ```\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion (:NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. (Note: Breaking a C-D bond is slower than breaking a C-H bond due to the kinetic isotope effect, so this pathway is less favored but still possible).\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C2.\n    3.  The lone pair on the C2 carbanion attacks C1, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) leaves.\n    4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom has been removed. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    ```\n       Br                    -Br-\n      /  \\                  ----->       (triple bond C1-C2)\n    (D)C--C(H)  + :NH2-                 C---C(H)\n    ||  ||      <-----                 ||  ||\n   (H)C--C(H)     D-NH2                (H)C--C(H)\n      \\  /                             \\  /\n       C                                C\n       |                                |\n      (H)                              (H)\n    (D at C2 abstracted)              (Benzyne)\n    ```\n\n**3. Mechanism Step 2: Addition (Attack on Benzyne)**\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (:NH₂⁻), now attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Pathway A (from 3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    The nucleophile :NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C6 of the 3-deuterobenzyne.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6. Protonation by NH₃ at C6 gives the final product. The -NH₂ group is at C1 and the deuterium is at C2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1. Protonation by NH₃ at C1 gives the final product. The -NH₂ group is at C6 and the deuterium is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the #1 position, the deuterium is now at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Products from Pathway B (from non-deuterated benzyne):**\n    The nucleophile :NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2 of the benzyne.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C2. Protonation by NH₃ at C2 gives **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    2.  **Attack at C2:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C2. A carbanion forms at C1. Protonation by NH₃ at C1 also gives **aniline**.\n\n**4. Summary of Possible Products:**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>",
