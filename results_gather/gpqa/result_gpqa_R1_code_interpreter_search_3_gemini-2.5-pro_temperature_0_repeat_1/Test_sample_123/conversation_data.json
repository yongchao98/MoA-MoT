    "This is a problem about special relativity, specifically time dilation and particle decay.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The number of particles, N, remaining after a time 't' from an initial number N₀ is given by the exponential decay law:\n    N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)\n    where T is the mean lifetime of the particle in the frame of reference where the time 't' is measured.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The particles are moving at relativistic speeds. Their lifetime as measured in the laboratory frame (T_lab) is longer than their lifetime in their own rest frame (the proper lifetime, τ) due to time dilation. The relationship is:\n    T_lab = γ * τ\n    where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are created at the center of the spherical detector and travel a distance equal to the radius, R = 30 m. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed 'v' is extremely close to the speed of light 'c'. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is:\n    t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c\n\n4.  **Fraction of Surviving Particles:** The fraction of particles that reach the detector wall is the number of particles that have not decayed after the time of flight, t_lab. We can combine the equations from steps 1, 2, and 3:\n    N / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / T_lab)\n    N / N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))\n\n    The term (R / (c * τ)) is a constant for a given particle type and detector setup. Let's call this constant 'k'.\n    k = R / (c * τ)\n    So, the governing equation is:\n    N / N₀ = exp(-k / γ)\n\n5.  **Applying the Initial Conditions:** We are given that when the Lorentz factor γ₁ = 20, one-third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector.\n    1/3 = exp(-k / 20)\n\n    To solve for 'k', we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -k / 20\n    -ln(3) = -k / 20\n    k = 20 * ln(3)\n\n6.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor:** We want to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂, required for two-thirds (2/3) of the particles to reach the detector.\n    2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)\n\n    Again, we take the natural logarithm:\n    ln(2/3) = -k / γ₂\n    -ln(3/2) = -k / γ₂\n    γ₂ = k / ln(3/2)\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute the value of 'k' we found in step 5 into the equation for γ₂ from step 6.\n    γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the numerator: 20 * ln(3)\nnumerator = 20 * math.log(3)\n\n# Calculate the denominator: ln(3/2) or ln(1.5)\ndenominator = math.log(1.5)\n\n# Calculate the new Lorentz factor\ngamma_2 = numerator / denominator\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe calculation yields approximately 54.18.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 40\nB) 54\nC) 28\nD) 68\n\nThe calculated value of ~54.18 is closest to 54.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the physics and the calculation involved:\n\n### **1. Understanding the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** Unstable particles decay over time. This process is statistical and is described by an exponential decay law. The number of particles `N` remaining after a time `t` from an initial sample `N₀` is given by `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)`, where `T` is the mean lifetime of the particle.\n*   **Special Relativity & Time Dilation:** A key consequence of Einstein's theory of special relativity is that time passes differently for observers in different reference frames. For a particle moving at a relativistic speed, its internal \"clock\" runs slower compared to a stationary observer's clock. This effect is called time dilation.\n*   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** This factor quantifies the extent of time dilation. The lifetime of a particle as measured in the lab frame (`T_lab`) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (its proper lifetime, `τ`). The relationship is `T_lab = γ * τ`. A higher Lorentz factor means a greater time dilation effect and a longer observed lifetime.\n\n### **2. Setting up the Equations**\n\nLet's define the variables:\n*   `R`: Radius of the detector = 30 m.\n*   `c`: Speed of light ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s.\n*   `v`: Velocity of the particles. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" we can approximate `v ≈ c`.\n*   `τ`: The proper mean lifetime of the particle (in its own rest frame). This is an unknown constant for this particle type.\n*   `γ`: The Lorentz factor.\n\nThe time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the detector wall in the lab frame is:\n`t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive this journey is given by the decay law, using the time and lifetime as measured in the lab frame:\n`Fraction surviving = N / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / T_lab)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `t_lab` and `T_lab`:\n`Fraction surviving = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n\nWe can group the constant terms `R`, `c`, and `τ` together. Let's define a constant `k = R / (c * τ)`. Our governing equation becomes:\n`Fraction surviving = exp(-k / γ)`\n\n### **3. Using the Initial Conditions**\n\nWe are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the fraction of surviving particles is `1/3`.\n\n`1/3 = exp(-k / 20)`\n\nTo solve for the constant `k`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -k / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -k / 20`\n`k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\nThis value `k` encapsulates the properties of the particle (`τ`) and the detector (`R`).\n\n### **4. Solving for the New Lorentz Factor**\n\nNow, we want to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, that results in a survival fraction of `2/3`.\n\n`2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -k / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -k / γ₂`\n`ln(3/2) = k / γ₂`\n\nNow, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = k / ln(3/2)`\n\nFinally, substitute the expression for `k` that we found in the previous step:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n### **5. Calculation**\n\nNow we compute the numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From the first condition, we found k = 20 * ln(3)\n# From the second condition, we found gamma_2 = k / ln(3/2)\n# So, we calculate gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n\ngamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe calculation gives a result of approximately 54.185.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) 40\nB) 54\nC) 28\nD) 68\n\nThe value `54.185` is closest to **54**.\n\n<<<B>>>",

They travel at \"ultra-relativistic velocities,\" which means their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall, as measured in the lab frame, is:\n    `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combining the Formulas:** We can determine the fraction of particles that survive the journey to the detector wall (`N/N₀`) by substituting the lab-frame time of flight (`t_lab`) and the lab-frame lifetime (`T_lab`) into the decay law:\n    `Fraction surviving = N / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / T_lab)`\n    Substituting the expressions from steps 2 and 3:\n    `Fraction surviving = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n\n    Notice that `R`, `c`, and `τ` are all constants for a given particle and detector. Let's group them into a single constant, `k = R / (c * τ)`. The equation simplifies to:\n    `Fraction surviving = exp(-k / γ)`\n\n5.  **Using the Initial Condition:** We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third (`1/3`) of the particles survive. We can use this to find the value of our constant `k`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-k / 20)`\n    To solve for `k`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -k / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -k / 20`\n    `k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor:** Now we need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, that allows two-thirds (`2/3`) of the particles to survive.\n    `2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n    Again, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -k / γ₂`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -k / γ₂`\n    `γ₂ = k / ln(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute the expression for `k` we found in step 5 into our equation for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n    To get the numerical answer, we can compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We derived the formula for the new Lorentz factor: gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)\n# Let's calculate this value.\n\nnumerator = 20 * math.log(3)\ndenominator = math.log(1.5)\n\ngamma_2 = numerator / denominator\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe calculation yields approximately 54.185.
