    "This problem requires us to deduce the identity of two compounds in a mixture by analyzing their combined 1H NMR spectrum. Let's break down the problem by predicting the spectrum for each candidate compound and then seeing which 1:1 mixture matches the given data.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Candidate Structures**\n\nAll four candidate compounds (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene) have the molecular formula C10H14. We need to determine the number and type of signals each would produce in a 1H NMR spectrum, which depends on the chemical equivalence of the protons.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry cutting through the two ethyl groups and another perpendicular to it.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Within each ethyl group, the -CH2- protons are adjacent to -CH3 protons, and vice-versa. This will lead to splitting. We expect **one quartet** (4H, for the -CH2- groups) and **one triplet** (6H, for the -CH3- groups).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The problem states there are only *singlets* in the aliphatic region. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated** from consideration.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is also highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent to each other, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent to each other. This results in two distinct sets of methyl protons. They will produce **two singlets** (one for 6H, one for 6H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent. The methyl group at C2 is unique, and the methyl group at C5 is unique. This results in three distinct sets of methyl protons. They will produce **three singlets** (one for 6H, one for 3H, and one for 3H), giving a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Mixture Spectrum**\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** Each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers produces only one aromatic singlet (for 2H). A 1:1 mixture of any two of them will show two distinct aromatic singlets, each integrating to 2H. The ratio of these integrals will be 2H:2H, which is 1:1. This matches the data and confirms the mixture contains two different tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:** This is the key to identifying the correct pair. We need a combination that results in three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. The total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's test the proposed pairs:\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Combined:** This mixture produces exactly three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Combined:** This would result in four aliphatic singlets.

This does not match the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, gives the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>",

They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n        *   Aliphatic Protons: There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1 and C4) and (C2 and C3). This will result in **two singlets (each integrating to 6H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n        *   Aliphatic Protons: There are three sets of methyl groups: (C1 and C3 are equivalent), (C2 is unique), and (C5 is unique). This will result in **three singlets (integrating to 6H, 3H, and 3H respectively)**, giving a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Spectrum of the 1:1 Mixture**\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options (B, C, and D).\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** Each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers produces one aromatic singlet (2H). A 1:1 mixture of any two of them will show two distinct aromatic singlets, one from each compound. Since the molar ratio is 1:1, the integration will be 2H:2H, which simplifies to a 1:1 ratio. This observation is consistent with any pair of these isomers and confirms the mixture contains two different tetramethylbenzenes.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:** This is the crucial part for identifying the correct pair. We need a combination that results in three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. The total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24 protons. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's test the pairs:\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This mixture produces exactly three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This would result in four aliphatic singlets, which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two singlets (6H each).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This would result in at least four signals (and possibly five if none of the signals overlap). This contradicts the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that matches all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
