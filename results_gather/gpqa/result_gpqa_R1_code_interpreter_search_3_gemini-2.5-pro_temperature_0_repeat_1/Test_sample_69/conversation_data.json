    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the molecule E and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given chemical reactions and clues.**\n\nWe are given four reactions and descriptions of the substances involved:\n1.  **A (solid) + 8 B (gas) -> C (bright red product)**\n2.  **C + 2 D (gas) -> E (extremely hazardous product)**\n3.  **C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)**\n4.  **D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent)** (1:1 ratio)\n\n**Step 2: Identify the substances starting with the most straightforward reactions.**\n\n*   **Reaction 4: D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent)**\n    This is a 1:1 reaction between two gases to form a common solvent. A very common example of this is the synthesis of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine.\n    Let's hypothesize:\n    *   **D = CO** (Carbon monoxide, gas)\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine, gas)\n    *   **H = COCl₂** (Phosgene, a liquid that can be used as a solvent)\n    The reaction is: CO(g) + Cl₂(g) -> COCl₂(l). This fits the description perfectly.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)**\n    This is a hydrolysis reaction. Since B is Cl₂, C must be a chloride of some element. The hydrolysis of a non-metal chloride typically produces HCl (a strong acid) and an oxoacid of the non-metal.\n    *   This means **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid).\n    The reaction also regenerates the solid reactant **A** and produces a weak acid **G**. This suggests a disproportionation reaction where the central element in C is converted into a more reduced state (solid A) and a more oxidized state (weak acid G).\n    Let's test elements that form chlorides and undergo this type of hydrolysis. Sulfur chlorides are a good candidate.\n    Consider the hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂):\n    2SCl₂ + 2H₂O -> S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)\n    *   This reaction produces solid sulfur (**A = S**).\n    *   It produces a strong acid (**F = HCl**).\n    *   It produces sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), a weak acid (**G = H₂SO₃**).\n    This reaction perfectly matches the description in clue 3. Therefore, it is highly likely that **C = SCl₂** and **A = S** (specifically the S₈ allotrope, which is solid).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) -> C (bright red product)**\n    Let's check if our identified substances fit this reaction.\n    *   A = S₈\n    *   B = Cl₂\n    *   C = SCl₂\n    The balanced chemical equation for the formation of SCl₂ from S₈ and Cl₂ is:\n    S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) -> 8SCl₂(l)\n    This reaction shows that 1 mole of S₈ reacts with 8 moles of Cl₂. This matches the \"8 equivalents\" stoichiometry given in the problem. Also, SCl₂ is described as a cherry-red liquid, which matches the \"bright red product\" description.\n\n**Step 3: Identify product E.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2: C + 2 D (gas) -> E (extremely hazardous product)**\n    Using our identified substances:\n    *   C = SCl₂\n    *   D = CO\n    The reaction is: SCl₂ + 2CO -> E\n    Let's consider the possible products. A plausible, balanced reaction is:\n    SCl₂ + 2CO -> COS (Carbonyl sulfide) + COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n    This reaction has a 1:2 stoichiometry between C (SCl₂) and D (CO), as stated in the problem. It produces two products: COS and COCl₂.\n    The problem states it produces \"the extremely hazardous product E\". We have already identified COCl₂ as substance H, and it is well-known as an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. It is plausible that E and H are the same substance (COCl₂), described by its hazardous nature in this context. The other product, COS, is toxic but generally considered less hazardous than phosgene. Therefore, it is most logical to conclude that:\n    *   **E = COCl₂** (Phosgene)\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n\nWe have identified **E = COCl₂** (phosgene). Now we need to determine its point group.\n\n1.  **Draw the Lewis structure and determine the 3D geometry.**\n    Carbon is the central atom. It is double-bonded to the oxygen atom and single-bonded to the two chlorine atoms.\n          O\n         //\n        C\n       / \\\n      Cl Cl\n    According to VSEPR theory, the three electron domains around the central carbon atom will arrange themselves in a trigonal planar geometry. The molecule is planar.\n\n2.  **Identify the symmetry elements.**\n    *   **Rotation Axis (Cₙ):** There is a two-fold rotation axis (C₂) that passes through the C=O bond. Rotating the molecule 180° about this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    *   **Mirror Planes (σ):**\n        *   There is a mirror plane that contains all four atoms (the plane of the molecule). Since this plane contains the principal C₂ axis, it is a vertical mirror plane (σᵥ).\n        *   There is a second mirror plane that is perpendicular to the molecular plane and contains the C₂ axis. This plane bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle. This is also a vertical mirror plane (σᵥ).\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion.\n    *   **Improper Rotation Axis (Sₙ):** There are no Sₙ axes other than those implied by other operations.\n\n3.  **Assign the Point Group.**\n    A molecule that has a C₂ principal axis and two vertical mirror planes (σᵥ) containing that axis belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the given options.**\n\nThe calculated point group for E (COCl₂) is C₂ᵥ.\nThe given options are:\nA) C2\nB) D4h\nC) D∞h\nD) C2v\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
