    "The user wants to find the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[CaY]^{2-}$, is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$).

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Equilibrium:** The problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which we can denote as $[CaY]^{2-}$ (where Y represents the EDTA ligand). This complex exists in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Understand the Equilibrium Constant:** The problem gives the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which corresponds to the formation of the complex:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    The expression for this constant is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Interpret the \"Ideal pH\" Assumption:** EDTA is a polyprotic acid. The concentration of the fully deprotonated species, $Y^{4-}$, which is the one that binds to the metal ion, is highly dependent on the pH of the solution. The term \"ideal pH\" implies that the pH is sufficiently high (typically pH > 10) so that essentially all the free EDTA in the solution is in the $Y^{4-}$ form. This allows us to use the given formation constant ($K_f$) directly, without needing to calculate a pH-dependent conditional constant ($K'_f$).\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the initial concentrations of the free ions are 0. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n5.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression:** Now, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Apply a Simplifying Assumption:** The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is a very large number. This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the side of the complex, meaning very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying assumption that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n7.  **Solve for x:** With this assumption, the equation becomes much easier to solve:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Rearrange to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Now, take the square root of both sides to find x:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to x.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n    This calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
