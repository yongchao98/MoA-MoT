    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to calculate the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the organic molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. The enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a substance is formed from its constituent elements in their most stable form under standard conditions.\n\nThe overall reaction for the formation of the compound is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(l or s)\n\nWe can calculate this using a Hess's Law cycle involving the atomization of the elements and the formation of the molecule from its gaseous atoms.\n\nThe key equation is:\nΔH_f (compound) = [Enthalpy of formation of gaseous atoms from elements] - [Enthalpy of atomization of the compound]\n\n**2. Analyze the Molecule's Structure and Formula**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the molecular formula and the types and numbers of chemical bonds in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Structure Drawing:**\n    ```\n          CH3                                     CH3\n           |                                       |\n    (CH3)-C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C - (CH3)\n                                |\n                               CH3\n    ```\n*   **Molecular Formula:** By counting the atoms, we find:\n    *   Carbon (C): 2 (in first (CH3)2) + 1 (C=) + 1 (=CH) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 1 (side CH3) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (=CH) + 1 (=C) + 2 (in last (CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Counting:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each singly bonded to a carbon atom. So, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** We count the single bonds between carbon atoms:\n        *   4 in the main chain (C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6).\n        *   5 connecting the methyl (CH3) groups to the main chain.\n        *   Total C-C single bonds = 4 + 5 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom, compound)**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound to form gaseous atoms. It is the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in the molecule.\n\nΔH_atom(compound) = (No. of C-C × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H × BE(C-H))\nΔH_atom(compound) = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\nΔH_atom(compound) = 1800 + 600 + 8800\nΔH_atom(compound) = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4.

Therefore, the energy to produce one mole of H(g) atoms is (1/2) × BE(H-H) = (1/2) × 100 = 50 kJ/mol.\n\nΔH_f(atoms) = (No. of C atoms × ΔH_atom(C)) + (No. of H atoms × ΔH_f(H(g)))\nΔH_f(atoms) = (12 × 1000 kJ/mol) + (22 × 50 kJ/mol)\nΔH_f(atoms) = 12000 + 1100\nΔH_f(atoms) = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n**5.

Analyze the Molecule's Structure and Formula**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the molecular formula and the types and numbers of chemical bonds in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** By counting the atoms in the structure, we find:\n    *   Carbon (C): 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 (C=) + 1 (=CH) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 1 (from side CH3) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (=CH) + 1 (=C) + 2 (from (CH3)2) = **12 Carbon atoms**.\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + (1+3) + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 Hydrogen atoms**.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Counting:** We need to count all the covalent bonds within one molecule.\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds ((CH3)2**C=CH**- and -CH**=C**(CH3)2). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** We count the single bonds between carbon atoms:\n        *   Two C-C bonds connecting the first two methyl groups to the chain.\n        *   Four C-C bonds forming the backbone of the chain.\n        *   One C-C bond for the methyl group branch.\n        *   Two C-C bonds connecting the last two methyl groups to the chain.\n        *   Total C-C single bonds = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements (Reactants)**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements in their standard states (12 moles of C(s) and 11 moles of H2(g)) into gaseous atoms (12 moles of C(g) and 22 moles of H(g)).\n\n*   **For Carbon:** 12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n    Energy = 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **For Hydrogen:** 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g). This requires breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    Energy = 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants:**\n    ΣΔH_atom(reactants) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Compound (Product)**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound to form gaseous atoms. It is the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 × BE(C-C) = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 × BE(C=C) = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 × BE(C-H) = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total Bond Energy of the Compound:**\n    ΣBE(product) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of the Compound (ΔH_f)**\n\nNow we apply the formula:\nΔH_f = [ΣΔH_atom(reactants)] - [ΣBE(product)]\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔH_f = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6.
