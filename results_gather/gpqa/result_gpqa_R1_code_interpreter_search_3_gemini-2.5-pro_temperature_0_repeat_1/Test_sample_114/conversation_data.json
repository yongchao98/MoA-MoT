    "This problem involves the annihilation of an electron and a positron, which are moving at relativistic speeds. To solve this, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Process:**\n    *   **Initial State:** An electron (e⁻) and a positron (e⁺) are moving towards each other along the x-axis.\n    *   **Final State:** Two photons (γ) are produced.\n    *   **Process:** Annihilation (e⁻ + e⁺ → γ + γ).\n\n2.  **Define Kinematic Variables (Initial State):**\n    *   Let the rest mass of both the electron and positron be `m_e`.\n    *   Let the speed of light be `c`.\n    *   **Electron (e⁻):**\n        *   Moves in the +x direction (from the left).\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ_e = 4`.\n        *   Energy, `E_e = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4 * m_e * c²`.\n        *   The velocity `v_e` is related to `γ_e` by `γ_e = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_e²/c²)`. We can find the momentum `p_e` using the energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n        *   `p_e * c = sqrt(E_e² - (m_e * c²)²) = sqrt((4 * m_e * c²)² - (m_e * c²)²) = sqrt(16 - 1) * m_e * c² = sqrt(15) * m_e * c²`.\n        *   So, the momentum of the electron is `p_e = sqrt(15) * m_e * c` in the +x direction.\n    *   **Positron (e⁺):**\n        *   Moves in the -x direction (from the right).\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ_p = 2`.\n        *   Energy, `E_p = γ_p * m_e * c² = 2 * m_e * c²`.\n        *   Similarly, we find the momentum `p_p`.\n        *   `p_p * c = sqrt(E_p² - (m_e * c²)²) = sqrt((2 * m_e * c²)² - (m_e * c²)²) = sqrt(4 - 1) * m_e * c² = sqrt(3) * m_e * c²`.\n        *   The momentum of the positron is `p_p = sqrt(3) * m_e * c` in the -x direction.\n\n3.  **Define Kinematic Variables (Final State):**\n    *   **Photon 1 (γ₁):**\n        *   Energy `E_γ1`.\n        *   Momentum magnitude `p_γ1 = E_γ1 / c`.\n        *   Moves at an angle `θ` to the x-axis (upper-right).\n    *   **Photon 2 (γ₂):**\n        *   Energy `E_γ2`.\n        *   Momentum magnitude `p_γ2 = E_γ2 / c`.\n        *   Moves at an angle `-θ` to the x-axis (lower-right).\n    *   The problem states the photons have the same energy: `E_γ1 = E_γ2 = E_γ`.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:**\n        `E_initial = E_final`\n        `E_e + E_p = E_γ1 + E_γ2`\n        `4 * m_e * c² + 2 * m_e * c² = E_γ + E_γ`\n        `6 * m_e * c² = 2 * E_γ`\n        `E_γ = 3 * m_e * c²`\n        Each photon has an energy of `3 * m_e * c²`.\n\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n        The total momentum vector must be conserved.\n        *   **y-component:** The initial momentum in the y-direction is zero. For the final momentum to be zero, the y-components of the photon momenta must cancel out.\n            `p_γ1y + p_γ2y = 0`\n            `(E_γ / c) * sin(θ) + (E_γ / c) * sin(-θ) = 0`\n            `(E_γ / c) * sin(θ) - (E_γ / c) * sin(θ) = 0`\n            This confirms that the angles must be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign, which matches the problem description.\n\n        *   **x-component:** The initial momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the electron's and positron's momenta.\n            `p_initial_x = p_e - p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c`\n            The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the photon momenta.\n            `p_final_x = p_γ1x + p_γ2x = (E_γ / c) * cos(θ) + (E_γ / c) * cos(-θ) = 2 * (E_γ / c) * cos(θ)`\n            Now, we set `p_initial_x = p_final_x`:\n            `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * (E_γ / c) * cos(θ)`\n            Substitute the value we found for `E_γ`:\n            `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * ((3 * m_e * c²) / c) * cos(θ)`\n            `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)`\n            Divide both sides by `m_e * c`:\n            `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n            `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angle:**\n    Now we compute the value of `θ` and then the total angle between the photons, which is `2θ`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta)\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in radians\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert theta to degrees\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The total angle between the photons is 2 * theta\ntotal_angle = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(total_angle)\n```\nThe code will calculate the final angle based on the derived formula.

Therefore, we must use the principles of **Special Relativity**, specifically:\n*   **Conservation of Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of the system is conserved.\n*   **Conservation of Relativistic Momentum:** The total momentum vector of the system is conserved.\n\n### 2. Define the Initial State (Before Annihilation)\nWe have an electron and a positron moving towards each other along the horizontal axis (let's call it the x-axis).\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The energy of a particle with rest mass `m` and Lorentz factor `γ` is given by `E = γmc²`.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The momentum `p` can be found from the energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This gives `pc = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²) = sqrt(γ² - 1)mc²`.\n\nLet `m_e` be the rest mass of the electron (and positron).\n\n**Electron (e⁻):**\n*   Moves in the +x direction.\n*   Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`.\n*   Energy: `E_e = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4 * m_e * c²`.\n*   Momentum (magnitude): `p_e * c = sqrt(γ_e² - 1) * m_e * c² = sqrt(4² - 1) * m_e * c² = sqrt(15) * m_e * c²`.\n*   Momentum vector: `P_e = (+sqrt(15) * m_e * c, 0)`.\n\n**Positron (e⁺):**\n*   Moves in the -x direction.\n*   Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`.\n*   Energy: `E_p = γ_p * m_e * c² = 2 * m_e * c²`.\n*   Momentum (magnitude): `p_p * c = sqrt(γ_p² - 1) * m_e * c² = sqrt(2² - 1) * m_e * c² = sqrt(3) * m_e * c²`.\n*   Momentum vector: `P_p = (-sqrt(3) * m_e * c, 0)`.\n\n**Total Initial Energy and Momentum:**\n*   Total Initial Energy: `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4 * m_e * c² + 2 * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c²`.\n*   Total Initial Momentum: `P_initial = P_e + P_p = ((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c, 0)`.\n\n### 3. Define the Final State (After Annihilation)\nTwo photons are produced.\n*   Photons are massless, so their energy is `E_γ = p_γ * c`.\n*   The problem states they have the same energy, `E_γ1 = E_γ2 = E_γ`.\n*   One photon moves at an angle `θ` to the x-axis, and the other at `-θ` (to conserve momentum in the y-direction).\n\n**Total Final Energy and Momentum:**\n*   Total Final Energy: `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ`.\n*   Total Final Momentum (x-component): `P_final_x = p_γ1_x + p_γ2_x = (E_γ/c)cos(θ) + (E_γ/c)cos(-θ) = 2(E_γ/c)cos(θ)`.\n*   Total Final Momentum (y-component): `P_final_y = p_γ1_y + p_γ2_y = (E_γ/c)sin(θ) + (E_γ/c)sin(-θ) = 0`.\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation Laws\n\n**Conservation of Energy:**\n`E_initial = E_final`\n`6 * m_e * c² = 2 * E_γ`\n`E_γ = 3 * m_e * c²`\nEach photon has an energy equal to three times the rest energy of an electron.\n\n**Conservation of Momentum (x-component):**\n`P_initial_x = P_final_x`\n`(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * (E_γ/c) * cos(θ)`\n\nNow, substitute the value of `E_γ` we just found:\n`(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * ( (3 * m_e * c²) / c ) * cos(θ)`\n`(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)`\n\nWe can cancel `m_e * c` from both sides:\n`sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Angle\nWe can now solve for `cos(θ)`:\n`cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\nThe question asks for the angle **between** the two photons, which is `2θ`. We can find this by first calculating `θ = arccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta) from the derived expression\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in radians\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# The total angle between the photons is 2 * theta. Convert to degrees.\ntotal_angle_deg = 2 * math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\nprint(total_angle_deg)\n```\n<execute_code>\n138.1759993830555\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the total angle between the photons is approximately 138.18 degrees. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
