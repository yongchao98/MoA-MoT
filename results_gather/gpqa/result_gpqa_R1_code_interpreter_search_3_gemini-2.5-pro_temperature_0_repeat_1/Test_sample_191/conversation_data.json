    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the effect of the charge inside the cavity:**\n    *   A positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the spherical cavity.\n    *   Conductors contain mobile charges (electrons). In the presence of the electric field from the charge $+q$, these mobile charges will redistribute themselves.\n    *   Negative charges (electrons) in the conductor will be attracted towards the $+q$ charge and will accumulate on the inner surface of the conductor, i.e., the wall of the cavity.\n    *   To determine the total amount of induced charge on the inner surface, we can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the bulk of the conducting material, enclosing the cavity.\n    *   A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside its bulk is zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$).\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this Gaussian surface is zero. This implies that the net charge enclosed by the surface must be zero.\n    *   The charge enclosed is the sum of the charge placed in the cavity ($+q$) and the induced charge on the inner surface ($q_{inner}$).\n    *   Therefore, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$, which means $q_{inner} = -q$. A total charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Analyze the charge on the outer surface:**\n    *   The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. Its net charge was zero.\n    *   Placing the charge $+q$ inside the cavity does not change the total charge of the conductor itself. The conductor is a single object.\n    *   The total charge of the conductor is the sum of the charge on its inner surface and the charge on its outer surface ($q_{outer}$). Since the conductor was initially neutral, we must have $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$.\n    *   Substituting the value of $q_{inner}$ from the previous step: $-q + q_{outer} = 0$, which means $q_{outer} = +q$.\n    *   So, a total charge of $+q$ appears on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Determine the distribution of the outer surface charge:**\n    *   The electric field at any point is the superposition of the fields from all charges: the charge $+q$ in the cavity, the charge $-q$ on the inner surface, and the charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n    *   A key principle of electrostatics is **electrostatic shielding**.

The external field is determined solely by the total charge enclosed within the outer surface and the geometry of the outer surface.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Charges and Conductor:** We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. A positive charge, $+q$, is placed inside a cavity within it. Conductors have mobile electrons that can redistribute themselves in response to an electric field.\n\n2.  **Induced Charge on the Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):**\n    *   The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract the free electrons within the conductor.\n    *   These electrons will move and accumulate on the surface of the cavity, which is the inner surface of the conductor.\n    *   To determine the total amount of this induced charge, we can use Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the bulk of the conducting material, enclosing the cavity.\n    *   A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside its material is zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$).\n    *   Therefore, the total electric flux through our imaginary Gaussian surface is zero.\n    *   Gauss's Law states that the net flux is proportional to the enclosed charge ($\\Phi_E = Q_{enc} / \\epsilon_o$). Since the flux is zero, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must also be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed in the cavity ($+q$) and the total charge induced on the inner surface ($q_{inner}$).\n    *   So, we have: $+q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   This implies that the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity is $q_{inner} = -q$.\n\n3.  **Induced Charge on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   The conductor as a whole was initially electrically neutral (net charge = 0).\n    *   Placing the charge $+q$ inside the cavity does not change the net charge of the conductor itself. Charge is conserved.\n    *   The total charge of the conductor is the sum of the charge on its inner surface and the charge on its outer surface ($q_{outer}$). Since the conductor was initially neutral, this sum must be zero.\n    *   $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$\n    *   Substituting the value we found for $q_{inner}$: $-q + q_{outer} = 0$.\n    *   This gives us $q_{outer} = +q$. A total charge of $+q$ is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding and Field at Point P:**\n    *   The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields created by all charges: (1) the charge $+q$ in the cavity, (2) the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface, and (3) the induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n    *   A crucial principle in electrostatics is **electrostatic shielding**. A closed conducting shell completely shields the region outside it from the electric fields of any charges located inside. This means that the combined electric field produced by the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface is exactly zero everywhere outside the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined *only* by the charge residing on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   Because the outer surface is a sphere and it is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement inside, the charge $+q$ on the outer surface will distribute itself **uniformly** over the sphere of radius $R$.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:**\n    *   We need to find the electric field at point P due to a charge $+q$ distributed uniformly on the surface of a sphere of radius $R$.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (a direct consequence of Gauss's Law), for any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is identical to that of a single point charge with the same total charge, located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, the system behaves as a point charge of magnitude $+q$ located at the center of the large spherical conductor.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center of this spherical conductor.\n    *   Using Coulomb's Law for the electric field of a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n    *   Substituting the values for our problem:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The information about the cavity's radius ($r$), its displacement from the center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$) is all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the shielding effect. The external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance from the center of the conductor ($L$).\n\nComparing our result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
