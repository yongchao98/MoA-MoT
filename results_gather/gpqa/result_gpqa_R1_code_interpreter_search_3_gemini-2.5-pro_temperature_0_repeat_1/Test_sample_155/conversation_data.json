    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid), 2. Aqueous acid (H3O+).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This two-step sequence achieves anti-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   Step 1 (mCPBA): This is an epoxidation reaction. It is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   Step 2 (H3O+): This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen, resulting in an anti-opening.\n    *   The net result of a syn-addition followed by an anti-addition is an overall anti-addition of two hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** There is a well-established stereochemical rule for this type of reaction: **T**rans-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition → **M**eso compound (Mnemonic: **TAM**).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene). The reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation. Therefore, the product is the meso-diol, which is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n**Let's verify this with a detailed mechanism:**\n1.  Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene gives a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide: (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  Acid-catalyzed opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide involves anti-attack by water. Attack at C4 (R) gives inversion to S, resulting in (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 (R) also gives inversion to S, resulting in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Both (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) describe the same single meso compound.\n3.  Similarly, opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide also yields only the meso-diol.\n4.  Thus, Reaction 1 produces one compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. mCPBA, 2. Aqueous acid (H3O+).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemical rule for this case is: **C**is-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition → **R**acemic mixture (Mnemonic: **CAR**).\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene). The reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation. Therefore, the product is a racemic mixture of the enantiomeric diols: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Let's verify this with a detailed mechanism:**\n1.  Epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene gives the meso-epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. It's a single achiral compound.\n2.  Acid-catalyzed opening of this meso-epoxide involves anti-attack by water. Attack at C4 (R) gives inversion to S, resulting in (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 (S) gives inversion to R, resulting in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  Since the starting epoxide is achiral, attack at the two (enantiotopic) carbons is equally likely, producing a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n4.  Thus, Reaction 2 produces a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nNote that the meso-diol is a diastereomer of the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are enantiomers of each other.\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Result:** Peak 1 for the meso-diol, and Peak 2 for the co-eluting enantiomers. Total = **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   It will separate the meso-diol from the other two compounds (since they are diastereomers). This gives one peak.\n    *   It will also separate the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers because they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase. This gives two more peaks.\n    *   **Result:** Peak 1 for the meso-diol, Peak 2 for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and Peak 3 for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer. Total = **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>",
