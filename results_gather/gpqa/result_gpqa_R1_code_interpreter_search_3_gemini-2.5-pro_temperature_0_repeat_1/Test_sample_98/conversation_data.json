    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent with all choices but doesn't distinguish between them.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four proposed structures are saturated alkanoic acids, so this information is also consistent with all options.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The crucial information lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) of two different signals:\n    1.  One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    2.  A different signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nTo have such complex splitting, a proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons. We will use the simple **n+1 rule** to predict the splitting, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons.\n\n*   A **dtq** requires a proton to have three sets of neighbors: one single proton (1+1=2, doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (2+1=3, triplet), and a set of three equivalent protons (3+1=4, quartet).\n*   A **dtt** requires a proton to have three sets of neighbors: one single proton (1+1=2, doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (2+1=3, triplet), and another different set of two equivalent protons (2+1=3, triplet).\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each option to see if it contains protons that would produce these specific signals. We will focus on the methine (CH) protons on the carbon backbone, as they are most likely to have multiple, different neighboring protons.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's number the carbon chain starting from the COOH group as C1.\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nThis formula represents **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**:\n`CH₃(5)-CH(4)(C₂H₅)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n\n*   **Proton on C3 (H₃):**\n    *   Neighbors:\n        1.  The single proton on C4 (1H).\n        2.  The two protons on C2 (2H).\n        3.  The two protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ attached to C3 (2H).\n    *   Predicted Splitting: Coupling to 1H gives a doublet. Coupling to 2H gives a triplet. Coupling to another 2H gives another triplet. This results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n*   **Proton on C4 (H₄):**\n    *   Neighbors:\n        1.  The single proton on C3 (1H).\n        2.  The three protons of the methyl group at C5 (3H).\n        3.  The two protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ attached to C4 (2H).\n    *   Predicted Splitting: Coupling to 1H gives a doublet. Coupling to 3H gives a quartet. Coupling to 2H gives a triplet. This results in a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**, which is the same as a **dtq** (the order depends on the relative magnitude of the coupling constants, J). This matches the second observed signal.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** This structure is predicted to have both a `dtt` signal and a `dtq` signal. This is a perfect match for the experimental data.\n\n---\n\nLet's quickly check the other options to confirm they are incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\nThis is **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**: `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(2)(C₂H₅)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Proton on C3 (H₃):** Neighbors are H₂ (1H), H₄ (2H), and the ethyl-CH₂ on C3 (2H). This gives a **dtt** (or tdt).\n*   However, there is no proton in this molecule with neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 3H. Therefore, there is **no dtq** signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\nThis is **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**: `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Proton on C3 (H₃):** Neighbors are H₄ (1H), H₂ (2H), and the methyl group on C3 (3H). This gives a **dtq**.\n*   However, there is no proton in this molecule with neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 2H. Therefore, there is **no dtt** signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\nThis is **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**: `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Proton on C3 (H₃):** Neighbors are H₂ (1H), H₄ (2H), and the methyl group on C3 (3H). This gives a **dtq** (or tdq).\n*   However, there is no proton in this molecule with neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 2H. Therefore, there is **no dtt** signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure A, **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH** (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid), has the necessary combination of proton environments to produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is a result of extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **\"No vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This means there are no protons attached to sp²-hybridized carbons of a C=C double bond. All four candidate structures are saturated alkanoic acids, so they all fit this description.\n    *   **\"A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\"**: This is a very specific and complex splitting pattern. For a proton signal to be split this way, it must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons. According to the n+1 rule:\n        *   **Doublet (d)**: It is coupled to **one** neighboring proton (1+1=2).\n        *   **Triplet (t)**: It is coupled to **two** equivalent neighboring protons (2+1=3).\n        *   **Quartet (q)**: It is coupled to **three** equivalent neighboring protons (3+1=4).\n        *   Therefore, a proton showing a `dtq` signal must have one neighbor that is a single proton, another neighbor that is a CH₂ group, and a third neighbor that is a CH₃ group.\n    *   **\"A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\"**: Similarly, for this pattern:\n        *   **Doublet (d)**: It is coupled to **one** neighboring proton (1+1=2).\n        *   **Triplet (t)**: It is coupled to **two** equivalent neighboring protons (2+1=3).\n        *   **Triplet (t)**: It is coupled to another, chemically non-equivalent set of **two** neighboring protons (2+1=3).\n        *   Therefore, a proton showing a `dtt` signal must have one neighbor that is a single proton, another neighbor that is a CH₂ group, and a third neighbor that is also a CH₂ group (but in a different chemical environment from the first one).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Structure:**\n    Let's analyze the protons on the chiral centers (the CH groups) for each molecule, as these are the most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.

    "### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   A \"very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers (cm⁻¹)\" is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A \"strong absorption peak at 1700 wavenumbers (cm⁻¹)\" is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is present in all candidates but does not help differentiate between them.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **\"No vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This indicates the absence of protons on a C=C double bond. All four candidate structures are saturated alkanoic acids, so they all fit this description.\n    *   **The Splitting Patterns are the Key**: The most definitive information comes from the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) of two different signals. We will use the **n+1 rule**, where a proton's signal is split into n+1 peaks by 'n' equivalent neighboring protons. For a signal to be split by multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighbors, we multiply the multiplicities.\n        *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighbors:\n            *   A **doublet (d)** is caused by **one** neighboring proton (n=1).\n            *   A **triplet (t)** is caused by **two** equivalent neighboring protons (n=2).\n            *   A **quartet (q)** is caused by **three** equivalent neighboring protons (n=3).\n            *   Therefore, the proton giving the `dtq` signal must be a CH group that is adjacent to another CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n        *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This means a different single proton is being split by three different groups of neighbors:\n            *   A **doublet (d)** is caused by **one** neighboring proton (n=1).\n            *   A **triplet (t)** is caused by **two** equivalent neighboring protons (n=2).\n            *   Another **triplet (t)** is caused by a second, chemically different group of **two** equivalent neighboring protons (n=2).\n            *   Therefore, the proton giving the `dtt` signal must be a CH group that is adjacent to another CH group, a CH₂ group, and a second, non-equivalent CH₂ group.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Structure:**\n    We will now examine the structure of each option to see if it contains protons that would produce these specific signals. We will focus on the methine (CH) protons on the carbon backbone, as they are the most likely to exhibit such complex splitting. Let's number the carbon chain starting from the COOH group as carbon 1.\n\n    *   **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n        ```\n              Et   Et\n              |    |\n        CH₃ - CH - CH - CH₂ - COOH\n         5    4    3    2      1\n        ```\n        *   **Proton on C3 (H₃):** Let's identify its neighbors. It is bonded to C3. The adjacent carbons are C2, C4, and the ethyl group's CH₂.\n            1.  Neighboring proton on C4 (1H) → splits the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n            2.  Neighboring protons on C2 (2H) → splits the signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n            3.  Neighboring protons on the ethyl group's CH₂ (2H) → splits the signal into another **triplet (t)**.\n            *   **Predicted Splitting for H₃:** **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n        *   **Proton on C4 (H₄):** Let's identify its neighbors. It is bonded to C4. The adjacent carbons are C3, C5, and the ethyl group's CH₂.\n            1.  Neighboring proton on C3 (1H) → splits the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n            2.  Neighboring protons on the ethyl group's CH₂ (2H) → splits the signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n            3.  Neighboring protons on the methyl group at C5 (3H) → splits the signal into a **quartet (q)**.\n            *   **Predicted Splitting for H₄:** **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second observed signal.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Structure A is the only one that perfectly accounts for both the `dtt` and `dtq` signals.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n        This structure has a proton at C3 that would give a `dtt` signal. However, it lacks any proton with the correct neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) to produce a `dtq` signal. Thus, it is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n        This structure has a proton at C3 that would give a `dtq` signal. However, it lacks any proton with the correct neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) to produce a `dtt` signal. Thus, it is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n        This structure has a proton at C3 that would give a `dtq` signal. However, it lacks any proton with the correct neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) to produce a `dtt` signal. Thus, it is incorrect.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis of the FTIR and ¹H NMR data, particularly the complex splitting patterns, uniquely identifies the compound. The FTIR confirms a carboxylic acid functional group. The ¹H NMR shows signals for a proton split into a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) and another proton split into a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`). Only structure A, **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**, has the necessary proton environments to produce both of these specific signals.\n\n<<<A>>>"
