    "*   **Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where structures can interconvert through the migration of a proton and a shift in double bonds. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen).\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure consists of a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH2- groups. These are alpha-carbons, and they possess alpha-hydrogens. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are alpha to two carbonyl groups. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can readily undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it exists in equilibrium with its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). The molecular formula for both forms is C6H6O3, confirming they are tautomers. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** Its structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at positions 1 and 4, and two C=C double bonds. The molecular formula is C6H4O2. While it has hydrogens on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups, any potential tautomerization would lead to a structure like hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene). However, the molecular formula of hydroquinone is C6H6O2. Since the molecular formulas are different, the conversion between benzoquinone and hydroquinone is a reduction/oxidation reaction, not tautomerism. Benzoquinone itself does not have a stable tautomeric form with the same molecular formula. Therefore, benzoquinone does *not* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH3 (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH3 (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the C=C double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (in the middle of the C=C bond). Molecules with a plane or center of symmetry are achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does *not* show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires us to identify two compounds based on their chemical properties: one that does not exhibit tautomerism and one that shows optical isomerism.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where two structures, called tautomers, are in equilibrium and can be readily interconverted. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H⁺) and a shift of a double bond. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen—a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens**: The hydrogens on the methylene groups are alpha-hydrogens because they are adjacent to the carbonyl carbons. In fact, each methylene group is alpha to *two* carbonyl groups, making these hydrogens particularly acidic and reactive.\n    *   **Tautomerization**: Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes keto-enol tautomerism. It exists in equilibrium with its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and highly stable compound.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone)**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 4 and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens**: The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. While they have hydrogens, attempting to form an enol would require breaking the conjugated system. The potential \"enol\" form would be hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene).\n    *   **Tautomerization Check**: The molecular formula of benzoquinone is C₆H₄O₂. The molecular formula of hydroquinone is C₆H₆O₂. Since the molecular formulas are different, the conversion between them is not tautomerism; it is a redox reaction (reduction of benzoquinone to hydroquinone). Benzoquinone itself does not have a stable tautomer with the same molecular formula.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, compound **A** (the one that does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure**: CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center Analysis**: Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The molecule is chiral and therefore **will show** optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is the *trans* isomer of an alkene with ester groups on both carbons of the double bond: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The molecule is planar. It possesses a center of symmetry (at the midpoint of the C=C bond). Molecules with a center of symmetry or a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **will not show** optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, compound **B** (the one that shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
