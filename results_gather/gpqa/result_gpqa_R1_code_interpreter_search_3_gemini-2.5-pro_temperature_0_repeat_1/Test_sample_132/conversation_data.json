Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**\nThe concentration of the orthophosphate ion is determined by the third dissociation (Equilibrium 3). We use the expression for Ka₃:\n*   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻] = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n\nWe rearrange this formula to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nNow, we substitute the known values. We use the initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻ (since its further dissociation is negligible) and the [H⁺] we just calculated from the buffer.\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M) ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option C.\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of the calculation, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# Define the given values from the problem statement\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # grams\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # grams\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.20000  # Liters\n\n# Dissociation constants for phosphoric acid\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the number of moles for each buffer component\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# Rearranging Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] gives [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] from the third dissociation (Ka3)\n# Rearranging Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] gives [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation to compare with the options\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.24e-07\n\nThe script confirms that the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>"
