    "This is a classic particle physics problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Decay Process:**\n    The decay is given by: `Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n    *   `Pi(+)` (pion) is the parent particle.\n    *   `mu(+)` (muon) and `nu` (neutrino) are the daughter particles.\n\n2.  **State the Given Information:**\n    *   The parent pion `Pi(+)` is stationary (at rest).\n    *   Rest mass of `Pi(+)`, `m_pi * c^2` = 139.6 MeV.\n    *   Rest mass of `mu(+)`, `m_mu * c^2` = 105.7 MeV.\n    *   The mass of the neutrino (`m_nu`) is considered to be zero for this calculation, which is a standard and very accurate approximation in this context.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n        Since the initial pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the final products must also be zero.\n        `p_initial = 0`\n        `p_final = p_mu + p_nu = 0`\n        This implies that the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum.\n        `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:**\n        The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n        `E_initial = E_final`\n        The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion:\n        `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`\n        The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino:\n        `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\n        So, `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n4.  **Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\n    `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n\n    *   For the muon (`mu+`):\n        `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\n    *   For the neutrino (`nu`), since we assume `m_nu = 0`:\n        `E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + 0`\n        `E_nu = p*c`\n        This also means the neutrino's total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (`KE_nu = E_nu`).\n\n5.  **Solve for the Unknowns:**\n    We have a system of equations. Let's solve for the momentum `p`.\n    From energy conservation: `E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - E_nu`\n    Substitute `E_nu = p*c`: `E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - p*c`\n\n    Now, substitute this expression for `E_mu` into the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n    `(m_pi * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\n    Expand the left side:\n    `(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * (p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\n    The `(p*c)^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * (p*c) = (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\n    Rearrange to solve for `p*c`:\n    `2 * (m_pi * c^2) * (p*c) = (m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    `p*c = [ (m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi * c^2) ]`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Values:**\n    To get the precise values, we can use a short Python script.\n\n```python\n# Given rest masses in MeV\nm_pi = 139.6\nm_mu = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the momentum-energy term (p*c)\n# p*c = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)\npc = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the neutrino is equal to its total energy, which is p*c\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# The total energy of the muon is found from the energy-momentum relation\n# E_mu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + m_mu^2)\nE_mu = (pc**2 + m_mu**2)**0.5\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of muon (KE_mu): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of neutrino (KE_nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nExecution of the code gives the following result:\n```\nKinetic Energy of muon (KE_mu): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic Energy of neutrino (KE_nu): 29.78 MeV\n```\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated kinetic energies are:\n    *   KE of muon (`mu+`): **4.12 MeV**\n    *   KE of neutrino (`nu`): **29.8 MeV** (rounding 29.78)\n\n    Comparing these results with the given options:\n    A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n    B) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n    C) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n    D) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n\n    The calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
