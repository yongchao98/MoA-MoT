    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:**\n    The problem describes the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. This method relies on the Doppler effect. As a planet orbits a star, it causes the star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This wobble results in a periodic change in the star's velocity along our line of sight. This change in velocity causes a periodic shift in the wavelengths of the star's spectral lines.\n\n    The relationship between the observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) and the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) is given by the Doppler formula:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem gives the *periodic shift*, which refers to the amplitude of this variation. This maximum wavelength shift corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, denoted as $K_{star}$.\n    Therefore, $K_{star} \\propto \\Delta \\lambda$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of Radial Velocity Amplitudes:**\n    We are given the wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   Planet #1: $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   Planet #2: $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n3.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet of mass $m_p$ in a circular orbit around a star of mass $M_{star}$ with an orbital period $P$, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity is given by:\n    $K_{star} = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}}$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n    Let's analyze the proportionality:\n    $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3} P^{1/3}}$\n\n4.  **Apply the Conditions Given in the Problem:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n    *   The problem does not specify the orbital inclinations ($i$). In such problems, it is a standard assumption that unstated parameters are the same for the systems being compared. Therefore, we assume $i_1 = i_2$, which means $\\sin i_1 = \\sin i_2$.\n\n    With these conditions, the terms $m_p$, $\\sin i$, and $(M_{star} + m_p)$ are the same for both systems. The relationship simplifies to:\n    $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $K_{star} \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    From the proportionality, we can write the ratio for our two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3$\n\n    Now, substitute the known ratio of the velocities:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Let's compute the numerical value of the ratio.\n    ```python\n    print((5/7)**3)\n    ```\n    <execute_result>\n    0.3644314868804665\n    </execute_result>\n    The result is approximately 0.364.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated value is $\\approx 0.364$.\n    The given options are:\n    A) ~ 0.85\n    B) ~ 1.40\n    C) ~ 0.36\n    D) ~ 1.96\n\n    Our calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
