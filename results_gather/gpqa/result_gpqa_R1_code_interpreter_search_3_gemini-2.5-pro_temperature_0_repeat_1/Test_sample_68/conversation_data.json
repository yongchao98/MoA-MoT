    "This problem requires us to determine the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to observe at least 30% of the decays of a moving particle, $X^0$. This involves concepts from special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction, applied to particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:**\n    *   A particle $X^0$ has a proper lifetime $\\tau_0$, which is its lifetime in its own rest frame.\n    *   In the laboratory frame (the Bubble Chamber), the particle is moving at a relativistic speed. Due to time dilation, its lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$, will be longer than its proper lifetime.\n    *   The relationship is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The particle travels a certain distance in the lab frame before it decays. This distance is not fixed; it follows an exponential decay law. The average distance traveled before decay is called the mean decay length, $L$.\n    *   The mean decay length is given by $L = v \\tau = v \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor relates the total energy ($E$) of a particle to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$). The formula is $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$.\n    *   In particle physics, mass is often given in units of energy (e.g., GeV), so the formula simplifies to $\\gamma = E/m_0$.\n    *   Given:\n        *   Total energy $E = 27$ GeV\n        *   Rest mass $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.9179$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L$):**\n    *   The mean decay length $L$ can be calculated using the momentum of the particle. The relativistic momentum $p$ is related to energy and mass by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   From this, we can find the momentum in energy units: $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - m_0^2}$.\n    *   The mean decay length is given by the formula: $L = \\frac{p}{m_0} c \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0} \\tau_0$.\n    *   Given:\n        *   Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n        *   Speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   First, calculate $pc$:\n        $pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV.\n    *   Now, calculate $L$:\n        $L = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n        $L \\approx 7.854 \\times (24 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n4.  **Determine the Minimum Resolution:**\n    *   The question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe *at least 30%* of the decays. This implies that the detector can only resolve decays that occur after the particle has traveled a certain minimum distance, let's call it $d_{res}$. If the decay happens before this distance, it's indistinguishable from the production point.\n    *   The probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ or more before decaying follows the exponential decay law: $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/L}$.\n    *   We want this probability to be at least 30% (or 0.30). So we set the condition for the minimum distance $d_{res}$:\n        $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) = 0.30$\n    *   This gives the equation: $e^{-d_{res}/L} = 0.30$.\n    *   To solve for $d_{res}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        $-\\frac{d_{res}}{L} = \\ln(0.30)$\n        $d_{res} = -L \\ln(0.30) = L \\ln(1/0.30)$\n    *   $\\ln(1/0.30) = \\ln(10/3) \\approx 1.204$.\n    *   $d_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation using a Python script for better precision:**\n    The following script performs the calculations described above.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given constants\nE = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0 = 3.41  # Rest mass in GeV\ntau0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458.0  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# 1.

Calculate the minimum resolution (d_res)\n# We need to observe at least 30% of decays. This means the particle must travel\n# a distance d_res before decaying. The probability of this is P(x >= d_res) = exp(-d_res / L).\n# We set this probability to 0.30.\n# exp(-d_res / L) = 0.30\n# d_res = -L * ln(0.30)\nd_res = -L * np.log(0.30)\n\nprint(f\"{d_res:.2e}\")\n```\nExecution of the code yields:\n```\n2.27e-06\n```\nThe calculated minimum resolution is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    *   B) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    *   C) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    *   D) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\nOur calculated value of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is closest to option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The small discrepancy might arise from slightly different interpretations or rounding of constants. For instance, if the question implies that the fraction of decays we *fail* to observe is 30% (i.e., decays happening *before* $d_{res}$), the result would be different: $1 - e^{-d_{res}/L} = 0.30 \\implies d_{res} = -L \\ln(0.70) \\approx 0.357 L \\approx 0.67 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is not among the options. Therefore, the initial interpretation is the correct one. The value from option D is the most plausible answer.\n\nLet's re-check the calculation with the value from option D to see what assumptions it might imply. If $d_{res} = 2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, then $d_{res}/L = 2.08 / 1.885 \\approx 1.103$. The fraction of observed decays would be $e^{-1.103} \\approx 0.33$. This is \"at least 30%\", so it is consistent. The difference between 2.27 and 2.08 is likely due to the specific values of constants used or a slight variation in the problem's premise not explicitly stated. Given the choices, 2.08e-6 m is the correct order of magnitude and the closest value.\n\n<<<D>>>",

    "This problem requires us to determine the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to observe at least 30% of the decays of a moving particle, $X^0$. This involves applying principles of special relativity to particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Relativistic Decay:**\n    *   A particle $X^0$ has a proper lifetime $\\tau_0$, which is its lifetime measured in its own rest frame.\n    *   In the laboratory frame (the Bubble Chamber), the particle is moving at a relativistic speed. Due to time dilation, its lifetime as measured in the lab, $\\tau$, is longer than its proper lifetime. The relationship is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The particle travels a certain distance in the lab frame before it decays. The number of particles that have not decayed after traveling a distance $x$ follows an exponential decay law, $N(x) = N_0 e^{-x/L}$, where $L$ is the mean decay length.\n    *   The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying and is given by $L = v\\tau = v\\gamma\\tau_0$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L$):**\n    *   A direct way to calculate the mean decay length is using the particle's momentum ($p$) and mass ($m_0$). The formula is $L = \\frac{p}{m_0} c \\tau_0$.\n    *   In relativistic mechanics, it's often easier to work with the quantity $pc$ (momentum multiplied by the speed of light), which has units of energy. The formula becomes $L = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} c \\tau_0$.\n    *   We can find $pc$ from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   Given:\n        *   Total energy $E = 27$ GeV\n        *   Rest mass energy $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        *   Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n        *   Speed of light $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   First, calculate $pc$:\n        $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2}$ GeV.\n    *   Then, calculate $L$:\n        $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2}}{3.41} \\times c \\times \\tau_0$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Minimum Resolution ($d_{res}$):**\n    *   The question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe *at least 30%* of the decays. A detector with a certain resolution can only distinguish a decay event from the production event if the particle travels a distance greater than or equal to that resolution.\n    *   Let the resolution be $d_{res}$. We want the fraction of particles that travel a distance $x \\ge d_{res}$ to be at least 0.30.\n    *   The probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law: $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/L}$.\n    *   To find the minimum resolution, we set this probability to the boundary condition of 30% (or 0.30):\n        $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/L} = 0.30$.\n    *   To solve for $d_{res}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        $-\\frac{d_{res}}{L} = \\ln(0.30)$\n        $d_{res} = -L \\ln(0.30)$\n\n4.  **Calculation using a Python script:**\n    To perform the calculation accurately, we use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given constants\nE = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458.0  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# 1. Calculate pc (momentum * c) in GeV\npc = np.sqrt(E**2 - m0c2**2)\n\n# 2. Calculate the mean decay length (L) in meters\n# The formula is L = (pc / m0c^2) * c * tau0\nL = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau0\n\n# 3. Calculate the minimum resolution (d_res)\n# We need to observe at least 30% of decays. This means the particle must travel\n# a distance d_res or more before decaying. The probability of this is P(x >= d_res) = exp(-d_res / L).\n# We set this probability to 0.30.\n# exp(-d_res / L) = 0.30\n# d_res = -L * ln(0.30)\nd_res = -L * np.log(0.30)\n\nprint(f\"{d_res:.3e}\")\n```\n```\n2.271e-06\n```\nThe calculated minimum resolution is $2.271 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    *   B) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    *   C) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    *   D) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\nOur calculated value is $2.271 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This value is very close to option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The other options differ by several orders of magnitude. The small numerical discrepancy between our calculation and option D is likely due to rounding of the input values used when creating the problem. A resolution of $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m would allow for the observation of approximately 33% of the decays ($e^{-2.08/1.887} \\approx 0.33$), which satisfies the condition of \"at least 30%\". Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
