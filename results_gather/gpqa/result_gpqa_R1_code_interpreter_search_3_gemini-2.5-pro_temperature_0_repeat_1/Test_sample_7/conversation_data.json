    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Role of Each Gene from Single Mutants\n\n*   **Wild-type (WT):** 100% resistance (This is our baseline).\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This means that gene G1 is responsible for some portion of the resistance. Its loss reduces resistance by 25% (100% - 75%).\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This means that gene G2 is absolutely essential for any resistance. Its loss is catastrophic.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. This means that gene G3 is also responsible for resistance. Its loss reduces resistance by 50% (100% - 50%).\n\n### 2. Identify the Transcription Factor by Analyzing Double Mutants (Epistasis)\n\nThe problem states that one gene is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of others. In a genetic pathway, an upstream gene's mutation often masks the phenotype of downstream genes. This phenomenon is called **epistasis**.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance.\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance.\n\nLet's compare these to the single mutants:\n*   The phenotype of the `g2` single mutant is 0% resistance.\n*   The phenotypes of the `g1g2` and `g2g3` double mutants are also 0% resistance.\n\nWhen the phenotype of a double mutant (`gXgY`) is the same as one of the single mutants (`gX`), we say that gene X is **epistatic** to gene Y. Here, the `g2` mutation's phenotype (0% resistance) completely masks the phenotypes of the `g1` (75% resistance) and `g3` (50% resistance) mutations.\n\nThis indicates that G2 acts upstream of both G1 and G3. If G2 is a transcription factor required to activate both G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would prevent both G1 and G3 from functioning, leading to a complete loss of resistance. This perfectly matches the data.\n\n**Conclusion 1:** G2 is the transcription factor and is epistatic to G1 and G3. This eliminates option A, which states G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Relationship Between G1 and G3\n\nNow we need to understand how G1 and G3, which are both downstream of G2, interact.\n\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance.\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance.\n\nThe phenotype of the double mutant (10% resistance) is much more severe than either of the single mutants. The loss of resistance (90%) is greater than the sum of the individual losses (25% from g1 + 50% from g3 = 75% total loss). This type of genetic interaction, where the double mutant shows a much stronger phenotype than the combination of single mutants, is known as a **synergistic interaction**.\n\nThis synergy suggests that G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways or have overlapping, compensatory roles. The best term among the options to describe this is **gene redundancy**. While not perfect redundancy (since single mutants have a phenotype), they are partially redundant, both contributing to the overall resistance. Losing both is far more detrimental than losing just one.\n\n**Conclusion 2:** G1 and G3 show gene redundancy (or a synergistic interaction). This makes option C (\"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\") a much better fit than option B (\"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy,\" which means one gene affects multiple traits, something we cannot determine from this experiment).\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Final Part of the Options\n\nLet's look at the remaining plausible options, B and C, and evaluate their final clauses.\n\n*   **Option B:** ... G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n*   **Option C:** ... G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n\nFor G1 to be epistatic to G3, the `g1g3` double mutant phenotype should be the same as the `g1` single mutant phenotype.\n*   `g1g3` phenotype = 10% resistance.\n*   `g1` phenotype = 75% resistance.\nThese are not the same, so G1 is not epistatic to G3 in the classical sense.\n\nSimilarly, for G3 to be epistatic to G1 (as in option D):\n*   `g1g3` phenotype = 10% resistance.\n*   `g3` phenotype = 50% resistance.\nThese are not the same, so G3 is not epistatic to G1.\n\nThere appears to be an inaccuracy in the options provided, as there is no simple epistatic relationship between G1 and G3. However, we must choose the *best* option.\n\n### 5. Synthesize and Select the Best Answer\n\nLet's review the options based on our strong conclusions:\n1.  **G2 is the TF.** (Options B, C, D are correct on this point).\n2.  **G1 and G3 have a redundant/synergistic relationship.** (Option C describes this best as \"gene redundancy\").\n\nOption C correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and provides the best description for the interaction between G1 and G3. Although its third clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is incorrect based on a strict definition, the first two clauses are the most accurate summary of the experimental results. The other options contain less accurate or unverifiable statements (e.g., pleiotropy, same promoter). Therefore, Option C is the most likely intended answer.\n\nThe proposed genetic pathway is:\nG2 (TF) activates both G1 and G3, which then act in parallel, partially redundant pathways to confer disease resistance.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a problem of genetic pathway analysis using mutant phenotypes. Let's break down the data step-by-step to deduce the relationships between the genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Single Mutants\nFirst, we look at the effect of knocking out each gene individually to understand its role in the resistance pathway. The wild-type (WT) plant has 100% resistance.\n*   **g1 mutant (75% resistance):** The loss of G1 function causes a 25% reduction in resistance. This means G1 contributes to the plant's defense.\n*   **g2 mutant (0% resistance):** The loss of G2 function completely eliminates resistance. This indicates that G2 is absolutely essential for the pathway to function.\n*   **g3 mutant (50% resistance):** The loss of G3 function causes a 50% reduction in resistance. This means G3 also plays a significant role in the defense mechanism.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Double Mutants to Determine Epistasis\nEpistasis is a phenomenon where the effect of one gene's mutation masks the effect of another. The gene that does the masking is called \"epistatic\" and is typically upstream in the genetic pathway. We are told one gene is a transcription factor (TF) that acts upstream, so finding the epistatic gene will likely identify the TF.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant (0% resistance):**\n    *   Phenotype of g1 alone: 75% resistance\n    *   Phenotype of g2 alone: 0% resistance\n    *   The phenotype of the double mutant (0%) is identical to the phenotype of the g2 single mutant. This means the `g2` mutation masks the `g1` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n\n*   **g2g3 double mutant (0% resistance):**\n    *   Phenotype of g2 alone: 0% resistance\n    *   Phenotype of g3 alone: 50% resistance\n    *   The phenotype of the double mutant (0%) is identical to the phenotype of the g2 single mutant. This means the `g2` mutation also masks the `g3` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n\nSince G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, it must act upstream of both of them. Given that one gene is an upstream transcription factor, we can confidently conclude that **G2 is the transcription factor**. This eliminates option A.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Interaction Between G1 and G3\nNow we know G2 activates a pathway involving G1 and G3. Let's look at the `g1g3` double mutant to understand their relationship.\n\n*   g1 loss: -25% resistance\n*   g3 loss: -50% resistance\n*   If the genes acted in completely separate pathways, we would expect an additive effect: a total loss of 25% + 50% = 75%, leaving 25% resistance.\n*   **Observed g1g3 phenotype: 10% resistance.**\n\nThe observed resistance (10%) is much lower than the expected additive effect (25%). This much stronger phenotype in the double mutant is a classic example of a **synergistic interaction**, which indicates that the two genes have **redundant or overlapping functions**. When one is lost, the other can partially compensate, but when both are lost, the system fails more dramatically than expected. Therefore, the statement \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" is the best description of this interaction. This makes option C highly plausible and rules out B (pleiotropy, which we can't determine) and D (same promoter, which we can't determine).\n\n### 4. Final Evaluation of the Options\nLet's review the best option, C, in its entirety:\n*   **\"G2 is a transcription factor\"**: Correct, as determined by the epistasis analysis.\n*   **\"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\"**: Correct, as determined by the synergistic effect in the `g1g3` double mutant.\n*   **\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\"**: This part is technically incorrect. For G1 to be epistatic to G3, the `g1g3` phenotype (10% resistance) would have to be the same as the `g1` phenotype (75% resistance), which it is not.\n\nDespite the inaccuracy of the third clause, Option C contains two correct and crucial conclusions derived directly from the data. The other options contain less accurate or unverifiable claims. In the context of a multiple-choice question, we must choose the best possible fit. Option C provides the most accurate overall description of the genetic pathway.\n\nThe most likely pathway is:\n**G2 (TF) → activates both G1 and G3 → G1 and G3 act in parallel, redundant pathways to provide resistance.**\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a classic genetic pathway problem. Let's break down the logic step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the role of each gene from the single mutant phenotypes.\nWe compare the resistance level of each single mutant to the wild-type (control) which has 100% resistance.\n*   **g1 mutant:** Has 75% resistance. This means that the G1 gene product is responsible for 25% of the total resistance (100% - 75%).\n*   **g2 mutant:** Has 0% resistance. This means the G2 gene product is absolutely essential for any resistance to occur. Its loss is catastrophic to the defense pathway.\n*   **g3 mutant:** Has 50% resistance. This means the G3 gene product is responsible for 50% of the total resistance (100% - 50%).\n\n### Step 2: Use double mutants to determine the gene order (epistasis).\nThe problem states that one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. In a genetic pathway, if a mutation in an upstream gene (like a master-switch transcription factor) is present, the phenotype of downstream genes won't matter. The upstream mutation's effect will mask the others. This is called epistasis. The gene that masks the others is \"epistatic\" and is upstream in the pathway.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** The resistance is 0%. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g1` single mutant (75% resistance). Therefore, the `g2` mutation is epistatic to the `g1` mutation. This places G2 upstream of G1.\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** The resistance is 0%. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g3` single mutant (50% resistance). Therefore, the `g2` mutation is also epistatic to the `g3` mutation. This places G2 upstream of G3.\n\nSince G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, it must be the upstream gene that regulates both. This strongly supports the conclusion that **G2 is the transcription factor**. This eliminates option A.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the relationship between G1 and G3.\nWe now know G2 is the upstream TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream. Let's look at their interaction.\n*   Loss of G1 alone causes a 25% drop in resistance.\n*   Loss of G3 alone causes a 50% drop in resistance.\n*   If they were in completely independent pathways, we might expect the double mutant `g1g3` to have a resistance loss that is the sum of the two, i.e., 25% + 50% = 75% loss, leaving 25% resistance.\n*   However, the **`g1g3` double mutant has only 10% resistance**. This phenotype is much more severe than expected from a simple additive effect. This phenomenon is called a **synergistic interaction**. It implies that G1 and G3 have functions that are partially overlapping or compensatory. When only one is missing, the other can still perform some of the function, but when both are missing, the system is much more severely compromised. This relationship is best described as **gene redundancy**.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the options based on our conclusions.\nLet's re-examine the options:\n*   A) G1 is a transcription factor... (Incorrect. G2 is the TF).\n*   B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy... (Pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits. We only measured one trait, so we cannot conclude this. The description of the G1-G3 interaction is weak).\n*   C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. (The first two points are strongly supported by the data. G2 is the TF, and the synergistic interaction between G1 and G3 is a form of gene redundancy. The third point, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is incorrect because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%). However, the first two conclusions are the most important and accurate descriptions of the pathway).\n*   D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1. (We cannot determine if they share a promoter from this data. Also, G3 is not epistatic to G1 because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%)).\n\nComparing the options, Option C provides the most accurate description of the genetic relationships, even with the flawed final clause. It correctly identifies the transcription factor and the nature of the interaction between the two downstream genes.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a problem about deducing a genetic pathway from the phenotypes of single and double mutants. Let's break down the evidence step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Single Mutants\nFirst, we assess the role of each gene by looking at what happens when it's knocked out individually. The baseline is the wild-type (control) plant with 100% resistance.\n\n*   **g1 mutant (75% resistance):** The loss of G1 function leads to a 25% reduction in resistance. This indicates G1 plays a role in the plant's defense.\n*   **g3 mutant (50% resistance):** The loss of G3 function leads to a 50% reduction in resistance. This indicates G3 also plays a significant role.\n*   **g2 mutant (0% resistance):** The loss of G2 function completely abolishes resistance. This suggests G2 is a critical, essential component of the pathway.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Upstream Transcription Factor using Epistasis\nThe problem states one gene is a transcription factor (TF) that acts upstream of the others. In a genetic pathway, a mutation in an upstream gene will mask the phenotype of mutations in downstream genes. This phenomenon is called **epistasis**. The gene whose phenotype is expressed in the double mutant is the \"epistatic\" gene and is upstream.\n\n*   **Consider the `g1g2` double mutant:** Its resistance is 0%. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g1` single mutant (75% resistance). Therefore, the `g2` mutation is epistatic to the `g1` mutation, meaning **G2 acts upstream of G1**.\n*   **Consider the `g2g3` double mutant:** Its resistance is 0%. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g3` single mutant (50% resistance). Therefore, the `g2` mutation is also epistatic to the `g3` mutation, meaning **G2 acts upstream of G3**.\n\nSince G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, it must be the upstream regulator. This strongly supports the conclusion that **G2 is the transcription factor**. This finding eliminates option A.\n\n### Step 3: Characterize the Interaction between G1 and G3\nNow we know G2 is the upstream TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream. To understand their relationship, we look at the `g1g3` double mutant.\n\n*   Loss of G1 alone causes a 25% drop in resistance.\n*   Loss of G3 alone causes a 50% drop in resistance.\n*   If their effects were simply additive, the double mutant would lose 25% + 50% = 75% of its resistance, leaving 25% resistance.\n*   However, the observed resistance of the `g1g3` double mutant is only **10%**.\n\nThis phenotype is much more severe than the simple sum of the individual defects. This type of interaction, where the double mutant is much worse off than expected, is called a **synergistic interaction**. It implies that the two genes have overlapping or compensatory functions. This is best described as **gene redundancy** (in this case, partial redundancy, since single mutants do have a phenotype).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Final Options\nLet's review the remaining options based on our conclusions:\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\" is correct.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy\" is not supported. Pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits; we only measured resistance. \"Gene redundancy\" is a much better description of their interaction.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\" is correct.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" is correct, as evidenced by their synergistic interaction.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is technically incorrect, as the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%). However, the first two statements are the most important and accurate conclusions from the data.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\" is correct.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\" cannot be concluded from this experiment.\n    *   \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is incorrect, as the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n**Conclusion:** Option C provides the most accurate description of the genetic pathway. It correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and correctly describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as redundant. Despite a minor inaccuracy in its third clause, it is by far the best fit among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a classic problem in genetics that requires deducing a gene pathway from the phenotypes of single and double mutants. Let's break down the analysis logically.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Phenotypes of Single Mutants\nFirst, we examine the effect of each gene individually by looking at the single knockout mutants. The wild-type (WT) plant serves as our control with 100% resistance.\n\n*   **g1 mutant (75% resistance):** The loss of the G1 gene results in a 25% decrease in resistance (100% - 75%). This means G1 contributes to the overall resistance.\n*   **g2 mutant (0% resistance):** The loss of the G2 gene completely eliminates resistance. This indicates that G2 is an essential gene for this resistance pathway to function at all.\n*   **g3 mutant (50% resistance):** The loss of the G3 gene results in a 50% decrease in resistance (100% - 50%). This means G3 also contributes significantly to resistance.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Gene Order using Epistasis Analysis\nThe problem states that one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of the others. We can identify this upstream gene by looking for epistasis in the double mutants. Epistasis occurs when the phenotype of one mutation masks the phenotype of another. The gene that does the masking (the epistatic gene) is upstream in the pathway.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** This mutant has 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance) and different from the `g1` single mutant (75% resistance). Therefore, the `g2` mutation is epistatic to the `g1` mutation. This places G2 upstream of G1.\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** This mutant also has 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance) and different from the `g3` single mutant (50% resistance). Therefore, the `g2` mutation is also epistatic to the `g3` mutation. This places G2 upstream of G3.\n\nSince G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, it must be the upstream regulator of both genes. This strongly supports the conclusion that **G2 is the transcription factor**. This eliminates option A.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Interaction Between G1 and G3\nNow we know the pathway is G2 → (G1, G3). We need to understand the relationship between G1 and G3. We do this by analyzing the `g1g3` double mutant.\n\n*   Loss of G1 alone causes a 25% drop in resistance.\n*   Loss of G3 alone causes a 50% drop in resistance.\n*   If their functions were in completely separate pathways, their effects would be additive. The expected resistance loss would be 25% + 50% = 75%, leaving 25% resistance.\n*   However, the observed resistance of the `g1g3` double mutant is only **10%**. The phenotype is much more severe than the simple sum of the individual defects. This is known as a **synergistic interaction**, which implies that the two genes have overlapping or compensatory functions. The best term to describe this relationship among the choices is **gene redundancy**.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options\nLet's review the options based on our findings:\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor...** Incorrect. Our analysis shows G2 is the transcription factor.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy...** The first part is correct. However, \"pleiotropy\" (one gene affecting multiple traits) is not the best description of the G1-G3 interaction; \"gene redundancy\" is more accurate based on the synergistic effect.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.** This option correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and correctly describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. The final clause, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is technically incorrect because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%). However, the first two points are the most significant and accurate conclusions from the data.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.** We cannot conclude they share a promoter from this data. The claim that G3 is epistatic to G1 is also incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** Option C provides the most accurate description of the genetic pathway. It correctly identifies the upstream transcription factor (G2) and the redundant relationship between the downstream genes (G1 and G3). Despite a minor inaccuracy in its third clause, it is the best-fitting answer among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
