    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), with an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the prochiral carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. Since there is already a chiral center at C5, the attack of the hydride ion can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two products.\n    *   Product 1A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 1B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations at C3. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. The reaction is stated to be 100% complete, meaning all the starting material is converted into these two products.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, yielding pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the two prochiral ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new chiral centers. We must consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Product 2A)\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Product 2B)\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Product 2C)\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol is identical to (2R, 4S) due to a plane of symmetry passing through C3. This is a **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   Products 2A and 2B are **enantiomers** of each other. They will be formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   Product 2C is a **meso compound**.\n    *   The meso compound (2C) is a **diastereomer** of both 2A and 2B.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Compounds in the mixture:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (P1A)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (P1B)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (P2A)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (P2B)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (P2C)\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   P1A and P1B are diastereomers. They have different physical properties (including polarity) and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   P2A and P2B are enantiomers. They have identical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   P2C is a diastereomer of P2A and P2B. It will have a different polarity and will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas and structures. They will have different retention times and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from Rxn II enantiomers) + 1 (from Rxn II meso) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** An HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Essentially, it can separate all stereochemically distinct compounds.\n*   **Compounds in the mixture:** The same five stereoisomers as above.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   P1A and P1B are diastereomers and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   P2A and P2B are enantiomers. The chiral column will resolve them. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   P2C is the meso compound. It is achiral and a diastereomer of the others. It will elute as a single, separate peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   Again, the products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II enantiomers) + 1 (from Rxn II meso) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The analysis shows there will be **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n*   The analysis shows there will be **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",

The racemic pair of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (P2A/P2B)\n    4.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (P2C)\n*   **Separation and Peak Count:**\n    *   P1A and P1B are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The enantiomeric pair (P2A/P2B) will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound (P2C) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity. It will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally very different (different molecular formulas, C₇H₁₆O₂ vs. C₅H₁₂O₂) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from Rxn II enantiomers) + 1 (from Rxn II meso) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** An HPLC with a chiral stationary phase creates a chiral environment.

Since the reaction starts from an achiral molecule, they will be formed as a racemic mixture (1:1 ratio).\n    *   Product 2C, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through C3). Therefore, it is a **meso compound** and is achiral. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration for this molecule.\n    *   The meso compound (2C) is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomers (2A and 2B).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties. However, it **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Compounds in the mixture:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (P1A)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (P1B)\n    3.  The racemic pair of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (P2A/P2B)\n    4.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (P2C)\n*   **Separation and Peak Count:**\n    *   P1A and P1B are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The enantiomeric pair (P2A/P2B) will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound (P2C) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity. It will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally very different (different molecular formulas, C₇H₁₆O₂ vs. C₅H₁₂O₂) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from Rxn II enantiomers) + 1 (from Rxn II meso) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** An HPLC with a chiral stationary phase creates a chiral environment. This allows it to distinguish between enantiomers and separate them. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   **Compounds in the mixture:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (P1A)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (P1B)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (P2A)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (P2B)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (P2C)\n*   **Separation and Peak Count:**\n    *   P1A and P1B are diastereomers and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   P2A and P2B are enantiomers. The chiral column will resolve them into two separate peaks. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   P2C is the meso compound. It is a distinct stereoisomer and will elute as a single, separate peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II enantiomers) + 1 (from Rxn II meso) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
