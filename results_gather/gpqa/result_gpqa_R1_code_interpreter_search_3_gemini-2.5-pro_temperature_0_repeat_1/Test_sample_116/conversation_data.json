    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism.\n\n**Understanding Optical Isomerism**\nOptical isomerism occurs in molecules that are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are:\n1.  The presence of a **chiral center** (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups).\n2.  **Atropisomerism**, which arises from restricted rotation around a single bond, leading to stable, non-superimposable conformations (often seen in substituted biphenyls).\nA molecule that is not chiral is called **achiral**. Achiral molecules are superimposable on their mirror images and typically possess an element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative, meaning it consists of two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   On one ring, there is a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃) at position 2 and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 6.\n    *   On the other ring, there is a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃) at position 2' and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 6'.\n*   **Analysis:** The positions 2, 2', 6, and 6' are called *ortho* positions. The substituents at these positions (-COOCH₃ and -NO₂) are bulky. Their size prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   **Chirality Check:** Because the rings are twisted and cannot become coplanar, we must check if the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is a distinct, non-superimposable molecule (an enantiomer). This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. It is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group, -OH). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Chirality Check:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter).\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exists as a pair of enantiomers and shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C₆H₅)₂CO. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. We need to check for elements of symmetry.\n*   **Chirality Check:** The two phenyl groups are identical. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is always achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups (-COOCH₃) are in a *trans* position relative to the C=C double bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the sp² hybridization of the carbons in the double bond.\n*   **Chirality Check:** Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral. Additionally, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nThe compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A molecule's chirality can arise from several features, most commonly a chiral center or axial/planar/helical chirality (like atropisomerism). Let's analyze each compound for these features.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Substituents:** There are bulky substituents (nitro groups, -NO₂, and dimethyl carboxylate groups, -COOCH₃) at all four *ortho* positions (2, 6, 2', and 6').\n*   **Analysis:** The steric hindrance caused by these large groups prevents the free rotation of the phenyl rings around the central C-C single bond. This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   **Chirality:** We must check if this locked conformation is superimposable on its mirror image. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Because it is non-planar and lacks these symmetry elements, it is chiral. This specific type of stereoisomerism arising from hindered rotation is called **atropisomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's focus on the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. We examine the four groups attached to this carbon:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Chirality:** Since all four groups attached to the C2 atom are different, this carbon is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter).\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. It exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and thus shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The formula is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Chirality:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is **achiral**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the sp² hybridization of the carbons in the double bond.\n*   **Chirality:** A planar molecule always has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Furthermore, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond. The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule **achiral**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (due to atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (due to a chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>",

The steric hindrance from these bulky groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   **Chirality:** Because the molecule is forced into a non-planar shape and lacks any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.
