    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Treatment Results**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through three tubes. Let's analyze the effect of each tube to identify the components of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater)**\n    *   This solution absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc.\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper is a reducing agent and will react with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, indicating a reaction with an oxygen-containing gas. The two most common possibilities are O₂ or N₂O (nitrous oxide).\n    *   The mass increase of the tube is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After all reactions, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. This strongly suggests it is a non-reactive gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Gaseous Products and Elemental Composition**\n\nLet's consider the two possibilities for the gas that reacted with copper.\n\n*   **Scenario A: The gas is O₂.**\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The 0.05 mol of O atoms would come from 0.025 mol of O₂ gas.\n    *   The gaseous products would be: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n*   **Scenario B: The gas is N₂O.**\n    *   Reaction: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n    *   The 0.05 mol of O atoms would come from 0.05 mol of N₂O gas.\n    *   This reaction also produces N₂. Moles of N₂ produced = Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The final remaining gas C is 0.10 mol of N₂. If 0.05 mol of this N₂ came from the reaction in Tube №3, then the other 0.05 mol of N₂ must have been present in the initial gas mixture from the decomposition.\n    *   The gaseous products from the decomposition would be: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n\nThe decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) at 200°C typically produces N₂O and H₂O (NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O), making Scenario B more chemically plausible at the given temperature. Let's proceed with this scenario.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial mixture (7.20 g) was an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Let's say there were `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B. The decomposition of this mixture yielded 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.20 mol H₂O.\n\nWe need to find two salts (A and B) containing N, H, and O (since no other elements are indicated) that would produce these products in a 1:1 molar ratio. Let's look at common ammonium salt decompositions:\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n\nThis combination fits perfectly.\n*   Let Salt A be **NH₄NO₂**.\n*   Let Salt B be **NH₄NO₃**.\n\nIf we have `n` moles of each:\n*   `n` NH₄NO₂ → `n` N₂ + `2n` H₂O\n*   `n` NH₄NO₃ → `n` N₂O + `2n` H₂O\n\nThe total products would be: `n` moles of N₂, `n` moles of N₂O, and `4n` moles of H₂O.\nComparing this to our derived product quantities:\n*   `n` mol N₂ = 0.05 mol → `n = 0.05`\n*   `n` mol N₂O = 0.05 mol → `n = 0.05`\n*   `4n` mol H₂O = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol → Matches our calculation for H₂O.\n\nSo, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Verify the Total Mass**\n\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture is 7.20 g.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ (N₂H₄O₂) = 2(14.01) + 4(1.01) + 2(16.00) = 64.06 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ (N₂H₄O₃) = 2(14.01) + 4(1.01) + 3(16.00) = 80.06 g/mol\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.06 g/mol = 3.203 g\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.06 g/mol = 4.003 g\n*   Total Mass = 3.203 g + 4.003 g = 7.206 g. This matches the given mass of 7.20 g.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   The formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   The formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nI will use a Python script to verify the calculations.\n```python\n# Molar masses\nmolar_mass_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\nmolar_mass_O = 15.999   # g/mol\nmolar_vol_STP = 22.4     # L/mol\n\n# Experimental data\nmass_H2O = 3.60  # g\nmass_O_gain = 0.80  # g\nvol_gas_C_STP = 2.24  # L\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate moles of products ---\n# Moles of H2O from tube 1\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / molar_mass_H2O\n\n# Moles of O atoms from tube 3\nmoles_O_atoms = mass_O_gain / molar_mass_O\n\n# Moles of final gas C from STP volume\nmoles_gas_C = vol_gas_C_STP / molar_vol_STP\n\n# --- Step 2: Deduce decomposition products ---\n# Hypothesis: Gas reacting with Cu is N2O (N2O + Cu -> N2 + CuO)\n# Moles of N2O must equal moles of O atoms\nmoles_N2O_decomposed = moles_O_atoms\n# Moles of N2 produced in tube 3 reaction\nmoles_N2_from_reaction = moles_N2O_decomposed\n# Moles of N2 from original decomposition\nmoles_N2_decomposed = moles_gas_C - moles_N2_from_reaction\n\n# --- Step 3: Identify salts and mole count 'n' ---\n# Hypothesis: Salts are NH4NO2 and NH4NO3\n# n NH4NO2 -> n N2 + 2n H2O\n# n NH4NO3 -> n N2O + 2n H2O\n# Total products: n N2, n N2O, 4n H2O\n# We can find 'n' from our calculated moles\nn = moles_N2_decomposed # or moles_N2O_decomposed\n\n# --- Step 4: Verify with mass ---\nmolar_mass_NH4NO2 = 2*14.007 + 4*1.008 + 2*15.999\nmolar_mass_NH4NO3 = 2*14.007 + 4*1.008 + 3*15.999\ntotal_mass_calculated = n * molar_mass_NH4NO2 + n * molar_mass_NH4NO3\n\n# --- Step 5: Calculate total atoms ---\n# Salt A: NH4NO2 (N2H4O2)\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2\n# Salt B: NH4NO3 (N2H4O3)\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(f\"Moles of H2O produced: {moles_H2O:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of N2 from decomposition: {moles_N2_decomposed:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of N2O from decomposition: {moles_N2O_decomposed:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Value of n (moles of each salt): {n:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass of mixture: {total_mass_calculated:.2f} g\")\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms in salts A and B: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\nMoles of H2O produced: 0.200 mol\nMoles of N2 from decomposition: 0.050 mol\nMoles of N2O from decomposition: 0.050 mol\nValue of n (moles of each salt): 0.050 mol\nCalculated total mass of mixture: 7.21 g\nTotal number of atoms in salts A and B: 17\n</execute_output>\nThe calculations confirm that the mixture consists of 0.05 moles of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and 0.05 moles of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).

The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2(1.008) + 15.999 ≈ 18.015 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition of the salts. This implies the salts do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the gas supplied oxygen atoms to the copper. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted.\n        *   Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 15.999 g/mol ≈ 0.05 mol.\n        *   Common nitrogen-based oxidizing gases from salt decomposition are O₂ and N₂O.\n            *   If the gas was O₂, the reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. Moles of O₂ would be 0.05 mol O / 2 = 0.025 mol O₂.\n            *   If the gas was N₂O, the reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. Moles of N₂O would be equal to the moles of O atoms, so 0.05 mol N₂O. This reaction also produces N₂.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of gas C remains at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas is inert to all the reagents used. Given that the salts are likely nitrogen-based (a common component of thermally unstable salts), Gas C is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the Composition of the Initial Gas Mixture:**\n    *   Let's evaluate the N₂O hypothesis for the gas in Tube №3, as the decomposition of ammonium salts often produces N₂O.\n    *   If 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted in Tube №3, it would produce 0.05 mol of N₂ (from the stoichiometry Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂).\n    *   The final 0.10 mol of N₂ (Gas C) is the sum of the N₂ produced in Tube №3 and any N₂ that was present in the original gas mixture.\n    *   N₂ (original) = N₂ (total) - N₂ (from N₂O reaction) = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Therefore, the gas mixture produced by heating the salts was:\n        *   0.20 mol H₂O\n        *   0.05 mol N₂O\n        *   0.05 mol N₂\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n    *   The problem states the initial mixture was an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. Let's say we started with `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n    *   We need to find two salts (likely containing N, H, O) whose decomposition products match our findings. Let's consider common ammonium salts:\n        *   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n        *   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃ (s) → N₂O (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n    *   This pair of reactions fits our products perfectly. If we assume Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃:\n        *   `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ produce `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n        *   `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ produce `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   The total products would be `n` mol N₂, `n` mol N₂O, and `4n` mol H₂O.\n    *   Comparing this with our calculated moles of products:\n        *   `n` = 0.05 mol (from N₂ and N₂O)\n        *   Total H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. This matches our calculation from Tube №1.\n    *   So, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n4.  **Verify the Total Mass:**\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01*2 + 1.01*4 + 16.00*2 = 64.06 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01*2 + 1.01*4 + 16.00*3 = 80.06 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.06 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.06 g/mol)\n    *   Total mass = 3.203 g + 4.003 g = 7.206 g. This is consistent with the given mass of 7.20 g.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** The chemical formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n        *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** The chemical formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n        *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",

The reaction is: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n        *   From the reaction stoichiometry, 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms. Therefore, the amount of N₂O that reacted must be **0.05 mol**.\n        *   This reaction also produces nitrogen gas (N₂). The moles of N₂ produced in this step are equal to the moles of N₂O reacted, which is 0.05 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of gas C remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas is inert to water absorption, a basic solution, and hot copper. This strongly indicates that Gas C is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the Composition of the Initial Gas Mixture:**\n\n    *   The final 0.10 mol of N₂ (Gas C) is the sum of the N₂ that was present in the original gas mixture and the N₂ that was produced in Tube №3 from the N₂O reaction.\n    *   N₂ (from original decomposition) = Total N₂ (Gas C) - N₂ (from N₂O reaction)\n    *   N₂ (from original decomposition) = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   Therefore, the thermal decomposition of the salt mixture produced:\n        *   0.20 mol of H₂O\n        *   0.05 mol of N₂O\n        *   0.05 mol of N₂\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n\n    *   The products (H₂O, N₂O, N₂) suggest the decomposition of ammonium salts. We need to find two salts that, in an equimolar mixture, produce these products in the calculated ratios.\n    *   Consider the well-known decomposition reactions:\n        *   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n        *   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n    *   This pair of reactions fits the products perfectly. Let's assume the equimolar mixture contained `n` moles of each salt.\n        *   `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ would produce `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n        *   `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ would produce `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   The total products would be `n` mol N₂, `n` mol N₂O, and `4n` mol H₂O.\n    *   From our analysis, we found 0.05 mol of N₂ and 0.05 mol of N₂O. This implies that `n = 0.05` mol.\n    *   Let's check the amount of water: Total H₂O = 4n = 4 × 0.05 = 0.20 mol. This matches our calculation from Tube №1.\n    *   Thus, the salts are **A = NH₄NO₂** and **B = NH₄NO₃**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Total Mass:**\n\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ (N₂H₄O₂) = 2(14.01) + 4(1.01) + 2(16.00) = 64.06 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ (N₂H₄O₃) = 2(14.01) + 4(1.01) + 3(16.00) = 80.06 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64.06 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.06 g/mol) = 3.203 g + 4.003 g = 7.206 g.\n    *   This value is consistent with the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B combined.\n    *   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):** The formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n        *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):** The formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n        *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n<<<B>>>",
