    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Define the initial conditions and relationships:**\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   It splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   The more massive fragment is `m1`, with `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the rest-mass energies (`E1 = m1*c^2` and `E2 = m2*c^2`):\n1.  `E1 = 2 * E2`\n2.  `E1 + E2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2 * E2 + E2 = 297 GeV`\n`3 * E2 = 297 GeV`\n`E2 = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, find `E1`:\n`E1 = 2 * E2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`) is `E1 = 198 GeV`, and for the less massive fragment (`m2`) is `E2 = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\n\nThe Q-value is the energy released from the conversion of mass into kinetic energy. It is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This Q-value is shared as kinetic energy between the two fragments (`T1` and `T2`).\n\n`Q = E_initial - (E1 + E2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy of the fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the kinetic energy `T1` using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\nFrom the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum (zero) must equal the total final momentum. The fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum (`p1 = p2`).\n\n`T1_classical = p1^2 / (2*m1)`\n`T2_classical = p2^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nSince `p1 = p2`, we can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p1^2 / (2*m1)) / (p2^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n\nUsing the rest-mass energies as proxies for mass (`E=mc^2` => `m=E/c^2`):\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = E2 / E1 = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2`\nThis means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**5. Calculate the kinetic energy `T1` using the correct (relativistic) formula:**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E_total`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass energy (`E_rest`) is `E_total^2 = (p*c)^2 + E_rest^2`.\nAlso, `E_total = T + E_rest`.\nSubstituting this gives: `(T + E_rest)^2 = (p*c)^2 + E_rest^2`.\nExpanding and rearranging for momentum: `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*E_rest`.\n\nAgain, from conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, which means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*E1 = T2^2 + 2*T2*E2`\n\nWe know `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`, `E1 = 198 GeV`, and `E2 = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**6. Find the difference:**\n\nThe difference is between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nConvert the result to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires us to calculate the kinetic energy of one of the fragments from a spontaneous fission event, first using a classical approximation and then using the correct relativistic formulas. The difference between these two values will be our answer.\n\n**1. Define Initial Conditions and Given Relationships**\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Let `m1` be the more massive fragment. We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nIt's more convenient to work with rest-mass energies (`E_rest = m*c^2`). Let `E1 = m1*c^2` and `E2 = m2*c^2`.\nFrom the given relationships:\n1.  `E1 = 2 * E2`\n2.  `E1 + E2 = (m1 + m2)*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nNow, we solve this system of equations. Substitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*E2 + E2 = 297 GeV`\n`3*E2 = 297 GeV`\n`E2 = 99 GeV`\n\nUsing this, we find `E1`:\n`E1 = 2 * E2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`) is `E1 = 198 GeV`, and the rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m2`) is `E2 = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`T1 + T2`).\n\n`Q = E_initial - (E1 + E2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate `T1` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments fly apart in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n`p1 = p2`\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p1^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p2^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nSince `p1 = p2`, the ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p1^2 / (2*m1)) / (p2^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n\nUsing the rest-mass relationship `m1 = 2*m2`, we get:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`\nThis implies `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**5. Calculate `T1` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n\nConservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`) still holds. However, we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E_total^2 = (p*c)^2 + E_rest^2`.\nThe total energy is the sum of kinetic and rest-mass energy: `E_total = T + E_rest`.\nSubstituting this into the relation gives: `(T + E_rest)^2 = (p*c)^2 + E_rest^2`.\nExpanding and rearranging for momentum squared:\n`T^2 + 2*T*E_rest + E_rest^2 = (p*c)^2 + E_rest^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*E_rest`\n\nSince `p1 = p2`, it follows that `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*E1 = T2^2 + 2*T2*E2`\n\nWe have the following values (working in units of GeV):\n*   `E1 = 198`\n*   `E2 = 99`\n*   `T2 = 3 - T1`\n\nSubstitute these into the equation:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n\nNow, solve for `T1`:\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value (`T1`) and the classical approximation (`T1_classical`).\n\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires us to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1`) using two different models: the correct relativistic model and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The final answer is the difference between these two calculated values.\n\n### **1. Initial Setup and Calculation of Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nFirst, let's define our variables and use the given information to find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus: `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-mass energies `E1 = m1*c^2` and `E2 = m2*c^2`.\n*   We are told one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let `m1` be the more massive one, so `m1 = 2*m2`. This directly translates to their rest-mass energies: `E1 = 2*E2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`. In terms of energy, this is `E1 + E2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2)`.\n\nNow we can calculate `E1` and `E2`:\n`E1 + E2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `E1 = 2 * E2`\n2.  `E1 + E2 = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2*E2 + E2 = 297 GeV`\n`3*E2 = 297 GeV`\n`E2 = 99 GeV`\n\nNow find `E1`:\n`E1 = 2 * E2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `E1 = 198 GeV`.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during the fission (the Q-value) is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy.\n\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (E1 + E2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThe total kinetic energy shared by the fragments is `3 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculation of `T1` using Classical Approximation**\n\nBy the law of conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction.\n`p1 = p2`\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p1^2 / (2*m1)) / (p2^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n\nSince `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculation of `T1` using Relativistic Formula**\n\nConservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`) still holds. However, we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E_total^2 = (pc)^2 + (E_rest)^2`.\nWe can rearrange this to solve for momentum: `(pc)^2 = E_total^2 - E_rest^2`.\nSince `E_total = T + E_rest`, we can write:\n`(pc)^2 = (T + E_rest)^2 - E_rest^2 = T^2 + 2*T*E_rest`\n\nSince `p1 = p2`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`. Therefore:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*E1 = T2^2 + 2*T2*E2`\n\nWe know `E1 = 198 GeV`, `E2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`. Substituting these values (in units of GeV):\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n\nNow, we solve for the correct `T1`:\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### **5. Finding the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. We convert GeV to MeV (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem asks for the difference in the calculated kinetic energy of a fission fragment using relativistic versus classical (non-relativistic) mechanics. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### **1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nFirst, we need to find the individual rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n\n*   **Initial rest-mass energy:** `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment mass relationship:** Let the fragments have rest-masses `m1` and `m2`. We are given that one is twice as massive as the other. Let `m1` be the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`. This relationship also applies to their rest-mass energies: `E1 = 2 * E2`.\n*   **Sum of fragment masses:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass.\n    `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    Multiplying by `c^2`, we get the sum of their rest-mass energies:\n    `E1 + E2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\nNow we have a system of two equations to solve for `E1` and `E2`:\n1.  `E1 = 2 * E2`\n2.  `E1 + E2 = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*E2 + E2 = 297 GeV`\n`3*E2 = 297 GeV`\n`E2 = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment, `E1`:\n`E1 = 2 * E2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### **2. Determine the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy (`T`) of the fragments.\n\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (E1 + E2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate `T1` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.\n`p1 = p2`\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nWe can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p1^2 / (2*m1)) / (p2^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n\nSince `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `1/2`. This means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculate `T1` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n\nConservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`) still holds. However, we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E_total^2 = (pc)^2 + (E_rest)^2`.\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the momentum term: `(pc)^2 = E_total^2 - E_rest^2`.\nSince the total energy is the sum of kinetic and rest energy (`E_total = T + E_rest`), we can write:\n`(pc)^2 = (T + E_rest)^2 - E_rest^2 = T^2 + 2*T*E_rest`\n\nSince `p1 = p2`, it follows that `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`. Therefore:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*E1 = T2^2 + 2*T2*E2`\n\nWe substitute the known values (`E1 = 198 GeV`, `E2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`):\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides of the equation cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n\nNow, we solve for the correct relativistic kinetic energy `T1`:\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### **5.

This relationship holds for their rest-mass energies as well: `E1 = 2 * E2`.\n*   **Sum of Masses:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass. In terms of energy, this is:\n    `E1 + E2 = 0.99 * E_initial = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\nNow, we solve the system of two equations:\n1.  `E1 = 2 * E2`\n2.  `E1 + E2 = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*E2 + E2 = 297 GeV`\n`3*E2 = 297 GeV`\n`E2 = 99 GeV`\n\nUsing this, we find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n`E1 = 2 * E2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### **2.

We can rearrange this to solve for the momentum term: `(pc)^2 = (T + E_rest)^2 - E_rest^2 = T^2 + 2*T*E_rest`.\n\nSince `p1 = p2`, we can set their squared momenta equal:\n`(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*E1 = T2^2 + 2*T2*E2`\n\nNow, substitute the known values (`E1 = 198 GeV`, `E2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`):\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n\nSolving for `T1`:\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### **5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. We convert GeV to MeV using the relation `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>"
