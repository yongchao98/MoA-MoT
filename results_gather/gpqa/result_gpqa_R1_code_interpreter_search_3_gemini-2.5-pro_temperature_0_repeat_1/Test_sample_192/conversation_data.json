    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\".\n    Let `N` be the number of stars and `plx` be the parallax. In physics and astronomy, a statement like \"quantity A varies with quantity B as f(B)\" usually refers to the differential distribution. This means the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    So, we can write this relationship as:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` or `dN/d(plx) = C₁ * plx⁻⁵` for some constant `C₁`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance `r`, specifically \"per unit range of distance, r\". This quantity is the number of stars per unit distance interval, which is `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Establish the Relationship between Parallax and Distance:**\n    Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely related. For astronomical distances, the relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    (Assuming `plx` is in arcseconds and `r` is in parsecs).\n\n4.  **Find the Relationship between the Differentials `d(plx)` and `dr`:**\n    To relate the distributions `dN/d(plx)` and `dN/dr`, we need to find the relationship between their differentials. We can do this by differentiating the equation from step 3 with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d(1/r)/dr = -1/r²`\n    This gives us `d(plx) = (-1/r²) * dr`.\n\n5.  **Transform the Distribution from Parallax to Distance:**\n    We can use the chain rule to relate the two distributions. The number of stars `dN` in a given small segment of the sky is the same regardless of whether we measure it in terms of parallax or distance.\n    `dN = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (dN/dr) * dr`\n    Therefore:\n    `(dN/dr) * dr = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)`\n    Solving for `dN/dr`, we get:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n    When dealing with number densities or distributions, we are interested in the magnitude, so we use the absolute value of the Jacobian `|d(plx)/dr|`.\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = |-1/r²| = 1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now, we substitute the known relationships into the equation from step 5.\n    *   From step 1: `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    *   From step 5: `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n    The expression is currently in terms of both `plx` and `r`. We need it solely in terms of `r`. We use the relationship from step 3 (`plx = 1/r`) to replace `plx`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁵ * r⁻²`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, is proportional to `r³`. This matches option D.\n\nAlternative check (using stellar density `n(r)`):\n*   The number of stars per unit parallax `A(plx)` is related to the number of stars per unit volume `n(r)` by `A(plx) ∝ n(r) * r⁴`. With `r=1/plx`, this is `A(plx) ∝ n(1/plx) / plx⁴`.\n*   We are given `A(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`.\n*   So, `1/plx⁵ ∝ n(1/plx) / plx⁴`.\n*   This implies `1/plx ∝ n(1/plx)`.\n*   Let `r = 1/plx`. The relationship becomes `r ∝ n(r)`. So, the stellar density is proportional to the distance.\n*   The number of stars per unit distance range `dN/dr` is the number of stars in a spherical shell, which is `n(r)` times the surface area of the shell (`4πr²`).\n*   `dN/dr ∝ n(r) * r²`.\n*   Substituting `n(r) ∝ r`, we get `dN/dr ∝ r * r² = r³`.\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:** The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". In physics and astronomy, this phrasing typically refers to a distribution function. It means that the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, which can be written as `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    Let `N` be the number of stars and `plx` be the parallax. We can write this relationship as:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, `r`, \"per unit range of distance\". This is asking for the expression for the number of stars per unit distance interval, which is `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:** The fundamental relationship between astronomical distance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`) is that they are inversely proportional.\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    (This assumes standard units, e.g., `r` in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds).\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule to Transform the Variable:** We need to convert the distribution from being a function of parallax to being a function of distance. We can use the chain rule for derivatives to relate `dN/dr` to `dN/d(plx)`:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Jacobian `d(plx)/dr`:** We need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance.\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = d(r⁻¹)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    Since number distributions must be positive, we are interested in the magnitude of this transformation, so we use the absolute value:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = |-1/r²| = 1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:** Now we substitute the known relationships into the chain rule equation.\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    We substitute `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵` and `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance `r`:** The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. To get the final answer, we must express everything in terms of `r`. We use the relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ * (1/r²)`\n    Simplifying the exponents:\n    `(1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n    So, the expression becomes:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁵ * r⁻²`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁽⁵⁻²⁾`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the cube of the distance.\n\n<<<D>>>",

This is a statement about a distribution. Let `N` be the number of stars and `plx` be the parallax. The number of stars per unit interval of parallax, denoted as `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`. We can write this as a mathematical proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This is asking for the expression for the number of stars per unit distance interval, which is `dN/dr`. We need to find what `dN/dr` is proportional to.\n\n3.  **Establish the Relationship between Parallax and Distance:**\n    In astronomy, parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are fundamentally related by an inverse relationship. For simplicity (and without loss of generality for a proportionality problem), we can write:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Relate the Differentials using the Chain Rule:**\n    To transform the distribution from a function of parallax to a function of distance, we use the chain rule of differentiation:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Transformation Factor `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to differentiate the expression for `plx` with respect to `r`:\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = d(r⁻¹)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    Since a number distribution cannot be negative, we are interested in the magnitude of the change.
