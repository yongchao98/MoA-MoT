    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:**\n    *   We have four identical particles.\n    *   The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions.\n    *   Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n    *   The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n\n2.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    *   The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by the formula:\n        E_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n        where 'n' is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    *   The problem defines a base energy unit E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²).\n    *   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n        E_n = n² * E\n\n3.  **Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\n    *   A complete quantum state for a particle in this system is defined by its principal quantum number 'n' and its spin magnetic quantum number 'm_s'.\n    *   For a spin-1/2 particle, m_s can be +1/2 (spin up, ↑) or -1/2 (spin down, ↓).\n    *   This means that for each energy level 'n', there are two distinct quantum states: (n, spin up) and (n, spin down).\n    *   Consequently, each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    *   To find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n    *   **Level n=1:** We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n        *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1² * E) = 2E.\n    *   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n        *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 * E₂ = 2 * (2² * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E.\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy:**\n        *   E_ground = (Energy from n=1) + (Energy from n=2) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n5.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited):**\n    *   To get the first excited state, we need to make the lowest-energy possible excitation from the ground state. This involves moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n    *   The particle configuration becomes:\n        *   **Level n=1:** 2 particles. Energy = 2 * E₁ = 2E.\n        *   **Level n=2:** 1 particle. Energy = 1 * E₂ = 1 * (2² * E) = 4E.\n        *   **Level n=3:** 1 particle.

We need to consider different possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n    *   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n    *   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n    *   Let's examine other possible excited configurations:\n        *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n            *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n            *   Energy = (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (1 * 1²E) + (2 * 2²E) + (1 * 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n        *   **Possibility B:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n            *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3.\n            *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * 1²E) + (2 * 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n        *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n            *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n            *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₄) = (2 * 1²E) + (1 * 2²E) + (1 * 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n    *   Comparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the second lowest energy is 18E.\n    *   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** E_2nd_excited = 18E.\n\n7.  **Final Result:**\n    *   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis sequence of energies matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Principles:**\n    *   The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles.

The energy contributed is 2 × E₁ = 2 × 1E = 2E.\n    *   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles here (one spin ↑, one spin ↓).
