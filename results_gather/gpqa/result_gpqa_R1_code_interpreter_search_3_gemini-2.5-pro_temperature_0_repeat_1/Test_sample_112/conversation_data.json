    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for an O-H stretching vibration that is undergoing hydrogen bonding. The significant broadness is highly characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid, which typically appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene, which supports the FTIR data (1650 cm⁻¹ peak).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very diagnostic fragment. We can calculate the mass of a potential fragment:\n        *   The carboxyl group (-COOH) has a mass of: 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45 amu.\n        *   Therefore, a fragment peak at m/z = 45 is strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined FTIR and Mass Spec data, we have very strong evidence for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group. A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with B) C6H10O2 and C) C6H12O2.\n    *   From the FTIR and 1H NMR data, we know the molecule also contains a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**.\n    *   Now, let's use the concept of the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)** to differentiate between the remaining two options. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (for a formula containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   Our identified functional groups require:\n        *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) = 1 DoU\n        *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) = 1 DoU\n        *   Total required DoU = 1 + 1 = **2**\n\n5.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **For B) C6H10O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n        This value matches the required DoU of 2.\n    *   **For C) C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n        This value does not match the required DoU. A molecule with this formula could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it could not also contain a C=C double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic data (a carboxylic acid and an alkene) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position (1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene** functional group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation provides direct confirmation of the **alkene** functional group suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. The mass of a carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as follows: 12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45. The presence of a fragment with m/z = 45 is strong evidence for a **carboxylic acid**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined data (broad O-H stretch, C=O at 1700 cm⁻¹, and m/z = 45 fragment), we can confidently conclude that the unknown compound is a **carboxylic acid**. A carboxylic acid functional group contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: B) C6H10O2 and C) C6H12O2.\n    *   The FTIR and 1H NMR data also clearly show the presence of a **C=C double bond** (an alkene).\n    *   To distinguish between the remaining options, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU represents the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` for a compound containing C, H, and O.\n    *   Our identified functional groups require:\n        *   One C=O double bond (in the carboxylic acid) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n        *   One C=C double bond (the alkene) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n        *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the DoU for the Remaining Options:**\n    *   **For B) C6H10O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n        This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our required value for a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n    *   **For C) C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n        This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the additional C=C double bond identified by the spectroscopic data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the evidence—the presence of a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>",

The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is located in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.
