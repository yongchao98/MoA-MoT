    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction starts with the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond and forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n        *   Step 1: CH₃CH₂C(=O)CH₃ + CN⁻ → CH₃CH₂C(O⁻)(CN)CH₃\n    *   The second step involves the protonation of this alkoxide intermediate to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH). Reagent 'A' must provide this proton (H⁺).\n        *   Step 2: CH₃CH₂C(O⁻)(CN)CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃CH₂C(OH)(CN)CH₃ (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n    *   A source of protons is required. This is typically achieved by adding an acid. H₃O⁺ represents an acidic aqueous solution (like dilute HCl or H₂SO₄), which serves as the proton source.\n    *   Let's evaluate the options for A:\n        *   **H₃O⁺:** This is a suitable proton source for the final step of cyanohydrin formation.\n        *   **NaHSO₃:** Sodium bisulfite is used to form bisulfite addition products, which are crystalline solids used for the purification of aldehydes and some ketones. It is not the correct reagent to form a cyanohydrin.\n    *   Therefore, A must be H₃O⁺. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, in the presence of water and usually with heating. The reaction proceeds via an amide intermediate.\n        *   R-C≡N + 2 H₂O --(Acid or Base)--> R-COOH + NH₃ (or NH₄⁺)\n    *   Reagent 'B' acts as the catalyst for this hydrolysis. We need to choose between the remaining options for B, which are HCl and CH₃COOH.\n    *   Let's evaluate the options for B:\n        *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. While it might protonate the nitrile to a small extent, it is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the hydrolysis all the way to the carboxylic acid under typical reaction conditions. Strong acid catalysis is required for this transformation.\n    *   Therefore, B must be HCl.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   Combining these findings, the correct choice is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
