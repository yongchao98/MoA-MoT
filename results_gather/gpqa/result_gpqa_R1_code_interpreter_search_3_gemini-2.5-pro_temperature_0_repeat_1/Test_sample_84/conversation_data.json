    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are identical for both and cancel out. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2), so the (1 - A) term also cancels out. The simplified ratio becomes:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((1 / a_1) / (1 / a_2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n    This shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period (Kepler's Third Law):** Kepler's Third Law for a given star states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This can be rearranged to express 'a' in terms of 'P':\n    a ∝ P^(2/3)\n    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    a_2 / a_1 = (P_2 / P_1)^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio:** Now we can substitute this relationship back into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((P_2 / P_1)^(2/3))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_1)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Relate Orbital Period to Radial Velocity Data:** The problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method. The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) caused by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)\n    (This is an approximation where the planet's mass M_p is much smaller than the star's mass M_star).\n    Since the planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight, so the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°, and sin(i) ≈ 1.\n    K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * M_p / M_star^(2/3)\n    To find the period P, we rearrange the formula:\n    K³ ≈ (2πG / P) * (M_p³ / M_star²)\n    P ≈ (2πG * M_p³) / (K³ * M_star²)\n    Since 2π, G, and M_star are constants for both planets, the period P is proportional to (M_p / K)³.\n    P ∝ (M_p / K)³\n\n8.  **Formulate the Period Ratio:**\n    P_2 / P_1 = [(M_p2 / K_2)³] / [(M_p1 / K_1)³]\n    P_2 / P_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)³ * (K_1 / K_2)³\n\n9.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ):** The Doppler shift formula relates radial velocity (v_r) to the shift in wavelength (Δλ):\n    Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c\n    The semi-amplitude K is the maximum radial velocity. Therefore:\n    K = c * (Δλ_max / λ₀)\n    Since c (speed of light) and λ₀ (rest wavelength) are constants, K is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift, Δλ_max.\n    K ∝ Δλ_max\n    This means the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\n    K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n\n10. **Combine All Ratios:** Let's substitute our findings back into the temperature ratio equation from step 6:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_1)^(1/3)\n    Substitute the period ratio from step 8:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [ (M_p2 / M_p1)³ * (K_1 / K_2)³ ]^(1/3)\n    Simplify the exponent:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K_1 / K_2)\n    Finally, substitute the K ratio with the Δλ ratio from step 9:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\n11. **Plug in the Values and Calculate:**\n    *   Mass of Planet 1 (M_p1) = 7 Earth masses\n    *   Mass of Planet 2 (M_p2) = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (Δλ_1) = 0.03 Å\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (Δλ_2) = 0.04 Å\n\n```python\n# Given values\nMp1 = 7  # Mass of Planet 1 in Earth masses\nMp2 = 5  # Mass of Planet 2 in Earth masses\nd_lambda1 = 0.03  # Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\nd_lambda2 = 0.04  # Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is derived as (Mp2/Mp1) * (d_lambda1/d_lambda2)\nratio = (Mp2 / Mp1) * (d_lambda1 / d_lambda2)\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357, which rounds to ~0.53.
