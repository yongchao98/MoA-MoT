    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's analyze the positions of the substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   Ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   tert-Butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   Nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The directing effects of these groups are:\n*   **-OEt**: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu**: Weakly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-NO2**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\nAchieving this specific 1,2,3-substitution pattern through a simple sequence of electrophilic aromatic substitutions (EAS) is challenging due to the directing rules. For instance, starting with 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene and nitrating it would lead to substitution at the 4 and 6 positions, not the 3 position. This suggests a more complex synthesis is required, possibly involving blocking groups or the conversion of one functional group to another to control regiochemistry.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it represents a chemically sound and logical pathway to the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts by forming aniline (benzene -> nitrobenzene -> aniline). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a complex that deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    The numbering is confusing. More importantly, step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is a diazotization reaction, which requires an amino group. The preceding steps produce nitro-tert-butylbenzene or its sulfonic acid derivative, neither of which has an amino group. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence involves reducing a nitro group to an amine (step iv), diazotizing the amine (step v), and then attempting to nitrate the resulting diazonium salt (step vi). Nitrating a diazonium salt is not a standard or logical reaction in this context; diazonium salts are typically used for replacement reactions (Sandmeyer, Schiemann, hydrolysis, etc.). Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze it carefully. The sequence of reactions listed is chemically plausible in terms of the types of reactions. However, if followed linearly as written, it does not lead to the correct product.\n    - Steps (i) to (vii) starting with the major para-nitro isomer from step (ii) would yield 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene, which is an isomer of the target.\n    - The final steps (viii) sulfonation and (ix) desulfonation are redundant at the end of this sequence.\n\n    However, there is a plausible (though not perfectly high-yield) synthesis route to the target molecule that uses all the reagents listed in Option A. This suggests that Option A lists the necessary \"ingredients\" for the synthesis, even if the order is presented confusingly.\n\n    **A Plausible Synthesis Route Using Reagents from Option A:**\n\n    1.  **High-yield synthesis of 2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene:** Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives mostly the para isomer. To get the ortho isomer in high yield, a blocking group strategy is used.\n        *   (i) `tBuCl/AlCl3`: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n        *   (viii) `SO3/H2SO4`: tert-Butylbenzene -> 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid (blocking the para position).\n        *   (ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration occurs ortho to the -tBu group -> 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n        *   (ix) `dilute H2SO4`: Desulfonation removes the blocking group -> **2-Nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n    2.  **Conversion to the target molecule:**\n        *   (iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group -> **2-tert-Butylaniline**.\n        *   (iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the crucial step. The amino group directs ortho and para (positions 3 and 5). The tert-butyl group also directs ortho (position 3). While position 3 is sterically hindered, it is electronically activated by both groups. Published literature confirms that the 3-nitro isomer (**2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**) is formed, although not as the sole product. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis, a separation would be required.\n        *   (v) `NaNO2/HCl`: The amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted to a diazonium salt.\n        *   (vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol -> **2-tert-Butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n        *   (vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis -> **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n    This detailed pathway demonstrates that the collection of reagents and reactions in Option A is the only one that can be logically assembled to form the desired product. The other options contain chemically invalid steps. Therefore, despite the confusing linear presentation, Option A is the intended correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires us to devise a multi-step synthesis for a specific trisubstituted benzene derivative, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. We must evaluate the four given reaction sequences to find the one that is chemically sound and leads to the desired product in high yield.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Structure:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   -OEt (ethoxy) at C1: Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   -tBu (tert-butyl) at C2: Weakly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   -NO2 (nitro) at C3: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Relative Positions:** The substituents are in a 1,2,3 arrangement. This specific regiochemistry is difficult to achieve with simple sequential electrophilic aromatic substitutions (EAS) due to the directing effects of the groups. For example, nitrating 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene would primarily occur at the 4- and 6-positions (para to the directing groups), not the 3-position. This suggests that a more sophisticated strategy involving blocking groups or functional group interconversions is necessary.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each sequence for chemical feasibility. It's common in such problems that the listed steps are not in the correct chronological order, but rather represent a \"pool\" of necessary reagents. We must check if a valid synthesis can be constructed from the reagents provided in each option.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts by making aniline (benzene -> nitrobenzene -> aniline). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring towards further electrophilic substitution. Therefore, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This sequence attempts to perform a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`) in step (iv). This reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). However, the preceding steps would produce a nitro- or sulfo-derivative of tert-butylbenzene, neither of which contains an amino group. Therefore, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence involves reducing a nitro group to an amine (step iv), converting the amine to a diazonium salt (step v), and then attempting to nitrate the ring (step vi). Diazonium salts are highly reactive intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer reaction), not for subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitution like nitration. Therefore, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This option is the only one remaining. Let's see if we can construct a logical synthesis pathway using these reagents. The linear order presented is confusing, but the collection of reagents allows for a sophisticated and effective synthesis.\n\n    **A Plausible High-Yield Synthesis Using Reagents from Option A:**\n\n    1.  **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation.** Benzene is reacted with `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃` to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **Step viii: Blocking the Para Position.** Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields mostly the para-isomer. To force ortho-nitration, we first block the sterically favored para position using a reversible sulfonation reaction. Reacting tert-butylbenzene with fuming sulfuric acid (`SO₃/H₂SO₄`) gives **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    3.  **Step ii: Ortho-Nitration.** Now, nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid with `HNO₃/H₂SO₄` occurs at the position that is ortho to the -tBu group and meta to the -SO₃H group (position 2), yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    4.  **Step ix: De-blocking.** The sulfonic acid group is removed by heating with `dilute H₂SO₄` (desulfonation), yielding **2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** in high yield.\n    5.  **Step iii: Reduction.** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group using `Fe/HCl` to give **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    6.  **Step iv: Second Nitration.** This is a key regiochemical step. We nitrate 2-tert-butylaniline. The desired product requires nitration at position 3. This position is ortho to both the strongly activating -NH₂ group and the activating -tBu group. Although sterically hindered, the concerted electronic activation from both groups directs the incoming nitro group to this position, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    7.  **Step v: Diazotization.** The primary amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt using `NaNO₂/HCl`.\n    8.  **Step vi: Hydrolysis to Phenol.** The diazonium salt is unstable and is hydrolyzed by heating in an aqueous acidic solution (`H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`) to replace the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    9.  **Step vii: Williamson Ether Synthesis.** The phenol is deprotonated with a base (`NaOH`) to form a phenoxide ion, which then acts as a nucleophile and reacts with ethyl bromide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis detailed pathway demonstrates that the reagents listed in Option A can be used in a logical sequence to achieve the desired synthesis. The other options contain fundamental chemical flaws.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem asks for the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. This is a complex multi-step synthesis problem that requires a careful analysis of substituent directing effects and the use of functional group interconversions and potentially blocking groups.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Structure:** The benzene ring has three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n*   **Directing Effects for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Regiochemistry:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is difficult to achieve through a simple sequence of EAS reactions. For instance, if we have 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene, both the -OEt and -tBu groups direct incoming electrophiles (like -NO₂) to positions 4 and 6, not position 3. This indicates that a more sophisticated strategy is required.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Reaction Sequences\n\nWe must evaluate each option to see if it represents a chemically viable pathway. It is common in such problems that the listed steps are not in the correct chronological order but represent a \"pool\" of available reagents from which a valid synthesis must be constructed.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence begins with `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄` followed by `ii) Fe/HCl` to form aniline. Step `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃` is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence attempts to use `iv) NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization) after steps that would produce tert-butylbenzene derivatives with nitro and/or sulfonic acid groups. Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂), which is not present at that stage. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence involves `v) NaNO₂/HCl` to form a diazonium salt, followed by `vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`. Attempting to nitrate a diazonium salt is not a standard or logical synthetic step. Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions (Sandmeyer, hydrolysis, etc.), not for subsequent EAS. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** This is the only remaining possibility. Let's determine if a logical synthesis can be constructed from the provided reagents. The presence of sulfonation (`viii`) and desulfonation (`ix`) strongly suggests the use of a blocking group strategy to control regiochemistry.\n\n### 3. Constructing the Synthesis from Option A\n\nHere is a plausible, high-yield pathway using the reagents from Option A, arranged in the correct order:\n\n1.  **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation.** Benzene is alkylated with `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃` to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    \n2.  **Step viii: Sulfonation (Blocking Group).** To achieve ortho-substitution in high yield, the more reactive para position is blocked. Reaction with fuming sulfuric acid (`SO₃/H₂SO₄`) yields **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    \n3.  **Step ii: Ortho-Nitration.** With the para position blocked, nitration with `HNO₃/H₂SO₄` is directed to the ortho position, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    \n4.  **Step ix: Desulfonation (Removing Blocking Group).** The sulfonic acid group is removed by heating with `dilute H₂SO₄`, yielding pure **2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    \n5.  **Step iii: Reduction.** The nitro group is reduced to a primary amine using `Fe/HCl` to give **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    \n6.  **Step iv: Second Nitration.** This is a critical step. We nitrate 2-tert-butylaniline. The target requires a nitro group at position 3. This position is ortho to the strongly activating -NH₂ group and also ortho to the -tBu group. The combined electronic activation from both groups directs the incoming -NO₂ to this position, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    \n7.  **Step v: Diazotization.** The primary amino group is converted to a diazonium salt (`-N₂⁺`) using `NaNO₂/HCl`.\n    \n8.  **Step vi: Hydrolysis.** The diazonium salt is heated in aqueous acid (`H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`) to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    \n9.  **Step vii: Williamson Ether Synthesis.** The phenol is deprotonated with a base (`NaOH`) and then treated with an alkyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final ether product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence is chemically sound and uses all the types of reactions listed in Option A to arrive at the target molecule. The other options contain chemically impossible steps.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This question requires us to identify the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. This is a complex synthesis problem that involves controlling the regiochemistry of substitution on the benzene ring. Let's analyze the target molecule and then evaluate each proposed reaction sequence.\n\n### Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Structure:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituents and their directing effects:**\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** A strongly activating ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** A weakly activating ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** A strongly deactivating meta-director.\n*   **Relative Positions:** The substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern. Achieving this specific arrangement is non-trivial because simple sequential electrophilic substitutions are unlikely to yield this product. For example, if we had 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene, nitration would occur at the 4 and 6 positions, not the 3 position. This suggests that a more sophisticated strategy involving functional group interconversions and possibly the use of blocking groups is necessary.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\nLet's evaluate each option.

Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂), forming a complex that deactivates the ring towards electrophilic attack. Therefore, this sequence is chemically invalid.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...`\n    This sequence attempts to perform a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`) in step (iv). This reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). The preceding steps produce derivatives of tert-butylbenzene that do not contain an amino group. Therefore, this sequence is chemically impossible at this stage.\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`\n    This sequence suggests forming a diazonium salt (step v) and then attempting to nitrate it (step vi).

The key is to use a blocking group strategy and several functional group transformations.\n\n    **Correct Synthetic Pathway using Reagents from Option A:**\n\n    1.  **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation.** Benzene reacts with `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃` to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **Step viii: Sulfonation (Blocking Group).** To force nitration at the ortho position, the sterically favored para position is blocked by sulfonation with fuming sulfuric acid (`SO₃/H₂SO₄`), yielding **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    3.  **Step ii: Ortho-Nitration.** With the para position blocked, nitration with `HNO₃/H₂SO₄` now occurs at the ortho position, giving **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    4.  **Step ix: Desulfonation (De-blocking).** The sulfonic acid group is removed by heating with `dilute H₂SO₄`, yielding pure **2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    5.  **Step iii: Reduction.** The nitro group is reduced to an amine using `Fe/HCl`, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    6.  **Step iv: Second Nitration.** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. The powerful ortho-directing amino group and the ortho-directing tert-butyl group both activate position 3 for electrophilic attack, leading to the formation of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    7.  **Step v: Diazotization.** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt (`-N₂⁺`) with `NaNO₂/HCl`.\n    8.  **Step vi: Hydrolysis.** The diazonium salt is heated in aqueous acid (`H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`) to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    9.  **Step vii: Williamson Ether Synthesis.** The phenol is converted to its conjugate base (a phenoxide) with `NaOH`, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nSince this is the only set of reagents that allows for a chemically sound synthesis of the target molecule, it is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This question asks for the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. This is a complex multi-step synthesis problem that requires a careful analysis of substituent directing effects, functional group interconversions, and the use of blocking groups to achieve the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule and Devise a Retrosynthesis\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group (-OEt) is an ether. Aryl ethers are most commonly made via the **Williamson ether synthesis** from a phenol. This means the immediate precursor should be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. This reaction would involve a base like `NaOH` and an ethyl halide like `EtBr`.\n\n*   **Precursor to the Phenol:** A phenol group (-OH) can be introduced onto a benzene ring by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (`-N₂⁺`). This means the precursor to the phenol would be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. The reaction involves diazotization with `NaNO₂/HCl` followed by heating in water (`H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`).\n\n*   **Precursor to the Aniline:** The molecule 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline has an amino group and a nitro group. It can be synthesized by nitrating **2-tert-butylaniline**. Let's check the directing effects: in 2-tert-butylaniline, the amino group (-NH₂) is a strong ortho, para-director, and the tert-butyl group (-tBu) is a weak ortho, para-director. Both groups direct an incoming electrophile (like -NO₂) to position 3. Although this position is sterically hindered, the combined electronic activation makes this a viable reaction.\n\n*   **Precursor to 2-tert-butylaniline:** This aniline can be made by the reduction of **2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. A standard method for this reduction is using a metal and acid, such as `Fe/HCl`.\n\n*   **Precursor to 2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene:** Synthesizing this isomer in high yield requires a **blocking group strategy**. Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives mostly the para-isomer due to sterics. To force ortho-nitration:\n    1.  Start with **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  Block the para position by sulfonation with fuming sulfuric acid (`SO₃/H₂SO₄`) to form **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    3.  Nitrate this intermediate. The nitro group will now be directed to the ortho position, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    4.  Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group by heating with dilute acid (`dilute H₂SO₄`), a process called desulfonation. This gives the desired **2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The synthesis begins with **benzene**, which is converted to tert-butylbenzene via **Friedel-Crafts alkylation** (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`).\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Forward Synthesis and Match with Options\n\nBased on the retrosynthesis, the correct forward sequence of reactions is:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene + `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃` → tert-Butylbenzene\n2.  **Sulfonation (Blocking):** tert-Butylbenzene + `SO₃/H₂SO₄` → 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid\n3.  **Nitration:** 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid + `HNO₃/H₂SO₄` → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid\n4.  **Desulfonation (De-blocking):** 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + `dilute H₂SO₄` → 2-Nitro-tert-butylbenzene\n5.  **Reduction:** 2-Nitro-tert-butylbenzene + `Fe/HCl` → 2-tert-Butylaniline\n6.  **Second Nitration:** 2-tert-Butylaniline + `HNO₃/H₂SO₄` → 2-tert-Butyl-3-nitroaniline\n7.  **Diazotization:** 2-tert-Butyl-3-nitroaniline + `NaNO₂/HCl` → Diazonium salt\n8.  **Hydrolysis:** Diazonium salt + `H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat` → 2-tert-Butyl-3-nitrophenol\n9.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** 2-tert-Butyl-3-nitrophenol + `NaOH/EtBr` → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**\n\nNow, we check which option provides this complete set of reagents.\n\n*   **Option A:** Contains `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`, `ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`, `iii) Fe/HCl`, `iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`, `v) NaNO₂/HCl`, `vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`, `vii) NaOH/EtBr`, `viii) SO₃/H₂SO₄`, and `ix) dilute H₂SO₄`. This option includes all the necessary reagents for the logical synthesis outlined above.\n\n*   **Option B:** Fails at step (iii), as Friedel-Crafts alkylation does not work on aniline.\n\n*   **Option C:** Fails at step (iv), as it attempts to diazotize a molecule without an amino group.\n\n*   **Option D:** Fails at step (vi), as it attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt, which is not a standard reaction.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the only one that provides a chemically viable set of transformations to produce the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>"
