    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** The core principles governing this particle annihilation process are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Analyze the initial state:**\n    *   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common simplification implying its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. We can approximate its kinetic energy as zero.\n    *   We can assume the proton is at rest in the lab frame. Therefore, its kinetic energy is also zero.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The rest mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical.\n        *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$\n    *   The total initial momentum ($P_i$) is approximately zero, as both particles are either at rest or moving very slowly.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final state:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. All these particles have the same mass, $m_A$.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the total energies of these four particles.\n    *   By the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum ($P_f$) must be equal to the total initial momentum, so $P_f \\approx 0$.\n    *   For the total momentum to be zero, the energy must be distributed among the four final particles. The most symmetric and simplest configuration is that all four particles are produced with the same kinetic energy, and thus the same total energy ($E_A$) and speed ($v_A$).\n    *   Therefore, the total final energy is $E_f = 4 \\times E_A$.\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle A is given by $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma_A$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$.\n    *   So, $E_f = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of energy:**\n    *   $E_i = E_f$\n    *   $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the velocity ($v_A$):**\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$:\n        *   $\\gamma_A = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   We need the values for the rest mass energies:\n        *   Rest mass energy of a proton, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27$ MeV.\n        *   Rest mass energy of particle A, $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV (given).\n    *   Now, we can calculate $\\gamma_A$.\n    *   Next, we relate the Lorentz factor to the velocity.
