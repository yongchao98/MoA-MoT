    "This problem is solved by applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept**\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), this relationship is expressed as:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nWhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\nIn the context of atomic and quantum states, the lifetime of a state (τ) can be considered as the uncertainty in time (Δt). Therefore, a state with a finite lifetime τ has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy level, ΔE. The formula is often approximated for practical purposes as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n**2. The Condition for Resolvability**\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E1 - E2|, must be larger than their combined energy widths. A common criterion is that the separation must be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths:\n\n|E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\nA simpler, less strict criterion is that the separation must be larger than the larger of the two energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width. Let's use the more rigorous sum criterion.\n\n**3. Calculation**\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state. We will use the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV·s, which is very convenient for this type of problem.\n\n*   ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations for each state.\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nNow, we apply the resolvability condition:\n\n*   Required energy difference |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n*   |E1 - E2| > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n*   |E1 - E2| > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   |E1 - E2| > 7.2402 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**4. Comparing with the Options**\n\nWe need to find the option that represents an energy difference greater than our calculated minimum of approximately 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁴ > 7.24 × 10⁻⁷)\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly resolved, as it is the only value greater than the sum of the natural line widths of the two states.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires the application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n### 1. Principle: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle connects the uncertainty in a particle's energy (ΔE) with the uncertainty in the time interval over which the energy is measured (Δt). For a quantum state with a finite lifetime (τ), the lifetime itself represents the uncertainty in time (Δt = τ). The principle is mathematically stated as:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nWhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor practical calculations involving the \"energy width\" or \"linewidth\" of a state, we can use the approximation:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nThis ΔE represents the inherent uncertainty or \"blurriness\" of the energy level. A state with a shorter lifetime will have a larger energy width.\n\n### 2. Condition for Resolution\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two separate energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than their combined energy widths. A standard criterion is that the separation must be larger than the sum of the individual energy widths:\n\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state using their given lifetimes.\n\n**Given:**\n*   Lifetime of state 1, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Lifetime of state 2, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n*   **Energy width of state 1 (ΔE₁):**\n    ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **Energy width of state 2 (ΔE₂):**\n    ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nNow, we apply the resolvability condition by finding the sum of the widths:\n\n*   **Minimum required energy difference:**\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    |E₁ - E₂| > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    |E₁ - E₂| > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    |E₁ - E₂| > 7.2402 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nSo, to clearly resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### 4. Comparing with Options\n\nLet's check which of the given options satisfies this condition:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:**  10⁻⁴ is significantly larger than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷. This is a valid energy difference.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:**  10⁻⁹ is smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV:**  10⁻⁸ is smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷.\n*   **D) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** 10⁻¹¹ is much smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy difference large enough to resolve the two states according to the uncertainty principle.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem is solved by applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Principle:** The question involves the \"lifetime\" of quantum states and the need to \"distinguish\" or \"resolve\" their energy levels. This directly points to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which connects the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) to its lifetime (τ).\n\n2.  **State the Uncertainty Principle:** The energy-time uncertainty principle is given by the relation:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    Where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in the time interval, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n3.  **Apply to Quantum States:** For a quantum state with a finite lifetime τ, the lifetime itself is the uncertainty in time (Δt ≈ τ). Therefore, the energy level of the state is not perfectly sharp but has an inherent \"energy width\" or \"linewidth\" given by:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n4.  **Define the Condition for Resolution:** To clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than their combined energy widths. A standard criterion is that the separation must be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths:\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:** We will now calculate the energy width for each state and then find the minimum required energy difference to resolve them.\n\nI will use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Given lifetimes in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy width (Delta E) for each state using Delta_E = h_bar / tau\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\n# The condition to resolve the two levels is that their energy difference\n# must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths.\nmin_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (lifetime 10^-9 s): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (lifetime 10^-8 s): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Minimum required energy difference to resolve the states: > {min_energy_difference:.4e} eV\")\n```\nThe code interpreter will now execute this script.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the calculation, the minimum required energy difference to resolve the two states must be greater than **7.240 x 10⁻⁷ eV**.\n\nNow, we compare this requirement with the given options:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is much larger than 7.240 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁴ = 1000 x 10⁻⁷)\n*   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This value is smaller than 7.240 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This value is smaller than 7.240 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁸ = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷)\n*   **D) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This value is much smaller than 7.240 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy difference that is sufficiently large to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<A>>>",
