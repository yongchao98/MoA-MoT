    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them or recall them from the theory of electrodynamics.\n\n### 1. Key Concepts and Definitions\n\n*   **Point Charge:** A charge `q` whose position at time `t` is given by the vector function $\\vec{s}(t)$.\n*   **Observer:** The potentials are measured at a position $\\vec{r}$ and time `t`.\n*   **Retarded Time ($t_r$):** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. The field measured at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, $t_r$, when the charge was at position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$. The time delay is the time it takes for light to travel from the source to the observer.\n    *   Let $\\vec{d}$ be the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point: $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The magnitude of this vector is $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   The time delay is $d/c$.\n    *   Therefore, the observation time `t` is related to the retarded time $t_r$ by the implicit equation:\n        $t = t_r + \\frac{d}{c} = t_r + \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$.\n*   **Charge's Velocity:** The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$.\n\n### 2. The Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general solutions for the potentials in the Lorenz gauge are given by the retarded potential integrals:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n### 3. Derivation of Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nSubstituting the delta-function densities into the integral for V and performing the integration (a standard but non-trivial procedure in electrodynamics textbooks) yields the Liénard-Wiechert scalar potential:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nThe subscript $t_r$ indicates that all quantities on the right-hand side (`d`, $\\vec{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nLet's manipulate this expression to match the format in the options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n### 4. Comparing with the Options\n\nNow let's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge. It neglects the retardation effect and the velocity-dependent term in the denominator. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the base potential V is wrong.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    The scalar potential V is incorrect. The expression for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is dimensionally and physically incorrect, as $\\vec{A}$ is a vector while the right-hand side is a scalar.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This option has a `+` sign in the denominator instead of a `-` sign. This corresponds to the \"advanced potentials,\" which are solutions to Maxwell's equations but are typically discarded as unphysical because they violate causality (the effect would precede the cause). The physically correct solutions are the \"retarded potentials.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",

Understanding the Setup\n\n*   **Source:** A point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$.\n*   **Observer:** The potentials are measured at position $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$.\n*   **Retardation:** The electromagnetic field propagates at the finite speed of light, $c$.

The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general retarded potential formulas by substituting the charge and current densities for a point charge. The standard derivation, found in textbooks on classical electrodynamics (like Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\"), yields the following results:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\nThe potential is not simply the static Coulomb potential evaluated at the retarded distance. An additional correction factor appears in the denominator due to the motion of the source during the emission of the signal. The correct formula is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nThe subscript $t_r$ reminds us that all quantities in the bracket ($d$, $\\vec{d}$, and $\\vec{v}$) must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $c$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n**Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\nSimilarly, the vector potential is given by:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nIt is also a useful fact that the two potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's compare our derived formulas with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This option perfectly matches the Liénard-Wiechert potentials we derived. The denominator $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ correctly accounts for the retardation effect and the motion of the source.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect. The expression for $V$ is the static Coulomb potential, which neglects the retardation effect entirely. It uses the instantaneous distance $r$ instead of the retarded distance $d$ and lacks the velocity-dependent term in the denominator.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect for the same reason as B (wrong V), and the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is dimensionally incorrect, as $\\vec{A}$ must be a vector, but the right-hand side is a scalar.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This is incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator corresponds to the \"advanced potentials,\" which are solutions to Maxwell's equations that are typically discarded as unphysical because they violate causality (the field would depend on the future position of the charge). The physically meaningful solution is the \"retarded potential,\" which has a minus sign.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) produced by a moving point charge. These are fundamental results in classical electrodynamics known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Retarded Potentials:** For a time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$, the general solutions for the scalar potential V and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ in the Lorenz gauge are given by the retarded potential integrals:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the retarded time. This is the time at which the signal (field) must have been emitted from the source point $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n2.  **Point Charge Densities:** For a single point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integrals:** Substituting these densities into the potential integrals is a standard procedure in electrodynamics. The key subtlety is that the delta function is evaluated at the retarded time, which itself depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. Performing the integration (which involves a change of variables and careful handling of the delta function's argument) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n4.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The result of the integration is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    Here, all quantities in the square brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$:\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observer.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the magnitude of this vector.\n    *   $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{d}$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Expression:** Let's rewrite the denominator to match the form given in the options:\n    $d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) = d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n    Now, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    Denominator becomes: $c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) = dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$\n    Numerator for V becomes: $qc$\n    Numerator for $\\vec{A}$ becomes: $q c \\vec{v}$\n\n    So the potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n6.  **Comparison with Options:**\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This exactly matches our derived expressions. The minus sign in the denominator is characteristic of the retarded potentials and accounts for the Doppler-like effect on the potential due to the source's motion.\n\n    *   **B) and C)** These options use the static potential form $\\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}$, which is incorrect as it ignores retardation and the velocity-dependent denominator.\n\n    *   **D)** This option has a plus sign in the denominator ($dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$). This corresponds to the \"advanced potentials,\" which are mathematically valid solutions but are physically discarded because they violate causality (the potential at time $t$ would depend on the future state of the charge).\n\nTherefore, option A correctly represents the physical (retarded) potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<A>>>",

Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's compare our derived formulas with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This option perfectly matches the Liénard-Wiechert potentials we derived. The denominator $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ correctly accounts for the retardation effect and the motion of the source.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect. The expression for $V$ is the static Coulomb potential, which neglects the retardation effect entirely. It uses the instantaneous distance `r` instead of the retarded distance `d` and lacks the crucial velocity-dependent term in the denominator.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect for the same reason as B (wrong V), and the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is dimensionally incorrect, as $\\vec{A}$ must be a vector, but the right-hand side is a scalar.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This is incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator corresponds to the \"advanced potentials.\" While these are mathematically valid solutions to Maxwell's equations, they are typically discarded as unphysical because they violate causality (the field would depend on the future position of the charge). The physically meaningful solution is the \"retarded potential,\" which has a minus sign.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
