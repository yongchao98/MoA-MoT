    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Reactant**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the structure of the starting material: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This is a -COOH group. By convention, if not specified, it is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: This is a -CHO (aldehyde) group at position 2 of the ring.\n*   **5-vinyl**: This is a -CH=CH2 group at position 5 of the ring.\n\nThe structure contains several sources of unsaturation:\n*   One ring.\n*   One carbon-carbon double bond within the ring (C=C).\n*   One carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group (C=C).\n*   One carbon-oxygen double bond in the formyl group (C=O).\n*   One carbon-oxygen double bond in the carboxylic acid group (C=O).\n\n**2. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Reactant**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of π bonds = 1 (in the ring) + 1 (in the vinyl group) + 1 (in the formyl group) + 1 (in the carboxylic acid group) = 4\n\nTotal IHD of the reactant = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\n**3. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key function is to perform a complete reduction of a molecule to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane or cycloalkane).\n\nSpecifically, Red P + HI will:\n*   Reduce aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Reduce alkenes (C=C) to alkanes (C-C).\n*   It does not typically break stable rings like cyclohexane.\n\n**4. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nApplying the reduction to our reactant:\n*   The cyclohex-3-ene ring will be reduced to a cyclohexane ring (the C=C bond becomes a C-C bond).\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n\nThe final product will be a substituted cyclohexane. The carbon skeleton is preserved, but all double bonds and oxygen atoms are removed. The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon.\n\n**5. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nNow we calculate the IHD for the final product.\nThe product is a cyclohexane ring with various alkyl substituents.\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring remains).\n*   Number of π bonds = 0 (all double bonds have been reduced to single bonds).\n\nTotal IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula. The reactant has 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in -COOH, 1 in -CHO, 2 in -CH=CH2). The reduction does not change the number of carbon atoms. The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon is CnH2n. For n=10, the formula is C10H20.\n\nUsing the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2\nIHD = 10 + 1 - 20/2 = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods give an IHD of 1 for the product.\n\n**6.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant Molecule**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   A ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   A double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This group contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This is an aldehyde group, which also contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH2)**: This group contains one carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\nThe total IHD of the reactant is the sum of all these contributions:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = **5**.\n\n**2. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its primary function is to perform a complete reduction of a molecule to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane or cycloalkane).\n\nSpecifically, Red P + HI will:\n*   Reduce alkenes (C=C) to alkanes (C-C).\n*   Reduce aldehydes (-CHO) completely to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   Reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   It does not break stable cycloalkane rings.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nApplying this powerful reduction to our starting material:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring will be reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH2-CH3).\n*   The `formyl` group (-CHO) will be reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) will be reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. All the double bonds (both C=C and C=O) have been removed. The only source of unsaturation remaining is the ring structure itself.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n*   **Number of rings**: The cyclohexane ring is preserved, so there is 1 ring.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: All double bonds were reduced to single bonds, so there are 0 π bonds.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD (product) = 1 (ring) + 0 (π bonds) = **1**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained from the reaction is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>",

Analyze the Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**\n\nFirst, let's determine the sources of unsaturation (rings and pi bonds) in the starting molecule. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is a count of these features.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered ring, which counts as **1** unit of IHD. It also contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which adds another **1** unit of IHD.\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This adds **1** unit of IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This adds **1** unit of IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH2)**: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).

Understand the Reaction: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and excess HI**\n\nThe reagent combination of red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) structures.\n\n*   **Aldehydes (-CHO)** are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Carboxylic acids (-COOH)** are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes (C=C)** are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n*   The reaction does not break stable cycloalkane rings.\n\n**3.

All the double bonds (both C=C and C=O) have been eliminated and replaced with single bonds and hydrogen atoms.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD of the final product is calculated based on its structure.\n*   **Number of rings**: The cyclohexane ring structure remains. So, there is **1** ring.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: All double bonds have been reduced to single bonds. So, there are **0** π bonds.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is the sum of these:\nIHD (product) = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for π bonds) = **1**.\n\nThe product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon, which by definition has an IHD of 1.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 5\nB) 0\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>",
