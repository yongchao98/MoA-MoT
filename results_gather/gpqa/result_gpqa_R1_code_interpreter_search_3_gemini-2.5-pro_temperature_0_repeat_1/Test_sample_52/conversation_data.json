    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogen atoms with two substituent groups. The aromatic core is therefore C6H4.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** An absorption peak for an ester group is present. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R', which contains one carbonyl group (C=O) and one C-O single bond. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the possible formulas.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two signals for aromatic hydrogens. A di-substituted benzene ring gives two signals in the aromatic region typically when it is para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). This symmetrical arrangement makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two protons on the other side, resulting in two signals (each appearing as a doublet). This accounts for 4 hydrogens (H4) attached to the C6 ring.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons:** There are two signals for vinyl hydrogens (protons on a C=C double bond).\n        *   One signal is a **doublet**, meaning it's coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   The other is a **doublet of quartets**, meaning it's coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet).\n        This splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by one neighboring vinyl proton (doublet). The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (quartet). This substituent accounts for C3H5 (C3 and 1+1+3=5 hydrogens).\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** There are two signals for -CH3 groups. One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl substituent identified above. The second methyl group must be part of the other substituent.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2):** There are no signals for -CH2 groups. This is a crucial piece of information. It means the second substituent, which is an ester, cannot contain an ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), or any other group with a -CH2- unit. The simplest ester group that contains a methyl group but no methylene group is a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)**. This substituent accounts for C2H3O2 (C2, 3 hydrogens, and O2).\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can assemble the fragments:\n*   A **para-substituted benzene ring** (C6H4).\n*   A **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3) as one substituent (C3H5).\n*   A **methyl ester group** (-COOCH3) as the other substituent (C2H3O2).\n\nThe most likely structure is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\n**3. Determine the Chemical Formula**\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from all the fragments to find the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from methyl ester) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Verify with Degree of Unsaturation**\n\nThe degree of unsaturation for a formula CxHyOz is calculated as: DoU = x + 1 - (y/2).\n*   For C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n*   Let's check this against our proposed structure:\n    *   Benzene ring = 4 (1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds)\n    *   C=C double bond in the propenyl group = 1\n    *   C=O double bond in the ester group = 1\n    *   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\nThe calculated degree of unsaturation matches the structure, confirming our formula is correct.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical formula of the unknown compound is C11H12O2, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to determine the chemical formula:\n\n**1. Analyze the Core Structure and Functional Groups:**\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the base structure is a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents. Since it's di-substituted, there are four hydrogens left on the ring. The core is C6H4.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester functional group has the general formula R-COO-R'. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms (O2) present in all the given molecular formula options.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Signals:**\n*   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring with four protons that give only two signals strongly suggests a symmetrical `para` (1,4) substitution pattern. In this pattern, the four protons on the ring are present as two chemically equivalent pairs, leading to two signals (typically two doublets). This confirms the C6H4 fragment.\n*   **Vinyl-H (2 signals - one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very characteristic splitting pattern for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n    *   Let's label the protons: `Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c)`.\n    *   The proton `H(a)` is split by `H(b)`, resulting in a **doublet**.\n    *   The proton `H(b)` is split by `H(a)` (a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group `H(c)` (a quartet). This combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n    *   This substituent fragment is `-CH=CH-CH3`, which has a formula of C3H5.\n*   **–CH3 groups (2 signals):**\n    *   One methyl signal comes from the propenyl group we just identified (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This signal would appear as a doublet because it's coupled to the adjacent vinyl proton `H(b)`.\n    *   The second methyl signal must belong to the ester substituent.\n*   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. The ester group must contain a methyl group but no methylene (`-CH2-`) groups. The simplest such group is a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`). An ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`) is ruled out because it contains a `-CH2-` group. Therefore, the second substituent is a methyl ester group, `-COOCH3`. This fragment has a formula of C2H3O2.\n\n**3. Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Molecular Formula:**\nNow, we sum the atoms from the identified fragments to get the total molecular formula:\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C6H4\n*   **Propenyl Group:** C3H5\n*   **Methyl Ester Group:** C2H3O2\n\nSumming these up:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Match with the Options:**\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",

Deconstruct the Provided Information:**\n\n*   **Structure Core:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogen atoms with two other groups. The remaining ring structure is therefore **C6H4**.\n*   **FTIR Data:** The spectrum shows the presence of an **ester group** (-COO-).

It points directly to a **propenyl group** (`-CH=CH-CH3`) attached to the ring.\n        *   Let's analyze the protons: `Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c)`\n        *   The proton `H(a)` is split only by `H(b)`, resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   The proton `H(b)` is split by `H(a)` (creating a doublet) and also by the three protons of the methyl group `H(c)` (creating a quartet). The combined effect is a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This substituent fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these methyl groups is the one at the end of the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   The second methyl group must be part of the ester substituent.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means the ester group cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`) or any other ester containing a methylene (`-CH2-`) bridge. Since the ester must contain the second methyl group, the only possibility that avoids a `-CH2-` group is a **methyl ester** (`-COOCH3`). This substituent fragment has the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n**2.
