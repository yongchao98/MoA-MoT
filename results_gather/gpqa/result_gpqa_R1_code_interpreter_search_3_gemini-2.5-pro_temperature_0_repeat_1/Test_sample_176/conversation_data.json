    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 ($L_1$) to the luminosity of Star_2 ($L_2$), which is $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principle:** The problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies. The luminosity ($L$) of a spherical black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    $L = A \\sigma T^4 = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where:\n    *   $R$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $T$ is the star's surface temperature.\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars, we can write the ratio of their luminosities:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1^2 / R_2^2) * (T_1^4 / T_2^4) = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information for the Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:\n    $R_1 = 1.5 * R_2$\n    Therefore, the ratio of their radii is:\n    $R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part of the problem.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs,max}$) are the same for both stars.

    "It appears the problem has been solved. The calculation shows that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\nHere is a summary of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity (L) of a star treated as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. The ratio of luminosities is therefore $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$.\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio:** We are given that $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$. So, $(R_1/R_2)^2 = 2.25$.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:** This was the key part of the problem.\n    *   The *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) were the same for both stars.\n    *   Star_1 has zero radial velocity, so its observed wavelength equals its emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1}$).\n    *   Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, causing a Doppler redshift. Its observed wavelength is $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Setting the observed wavelengths equal gives $\\lambda_{em,1} = \\lambda_{em,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Using Wien's Law, which states that the emitted peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature ($\\lambda_{em} \\propto 1/T$), we found the temperature ratio to be $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_2/c)$.\n\n4.  **Calculation:** Plugging the values into the luminosity ratio formula, the Python script calculated the result to be ~2.229, which rounds to 2.23.\n\nThe information about the stars' masses was not needed for this calculation, as the problem provided a direct way to find the temperature ratio using spectroscopy and radial velocity data.\n\nThe correct option is **A**.\n\nIf you have any more questions or would like clarification on any of the steps, feel free to ask",
    "The problem has been fully analyzed and solved. The calculation confirms that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\nThe final answer is derived from the Stefan-Boltzmann law and corrected for the Doppler effect on the observed wavelength of Star_2, as detailed in the previous steps.\n\n<<<A>>>"
