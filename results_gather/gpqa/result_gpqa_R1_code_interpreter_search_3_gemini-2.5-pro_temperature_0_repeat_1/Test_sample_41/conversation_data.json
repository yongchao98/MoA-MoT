    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit around a star is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n    Since all three planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant. The problem states that the albedo ($A$) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the term $T_{star} (R_{star}/2)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$ is a constant for the entire system.\n    This simplifies the relationship to:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n2.  **Use the Temperature Ratios to find the Ratios of Orbital Radii.**\n    From the proportionality $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$, we can write the ratio of temperatures for any two planets (i and j) as:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{a_i}}{1/\\sqrt{a_j}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_j}{a_i}}$\n    Squaring both sides gives the ratio of their orbital radii:\n    $\\frac{a_j}{a_i} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}} \\right)^2$\n\n    We are given the temperature ratios:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = 1.4$\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 2.3$\n\n    Note: The numbering of the planets (1, 2, 3) and the fact that the temperature ratios are greater than 1 imply an ordered system where Planet 1 is the hottest (and closest to the star) and Planet 3 is the coldest (and farthest).\n\n    Now, we can calculate the ratios of the orbital radii:\n    *   For Planet 1 and Planet 2:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\right)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96$\n    *   For Planet 2 and Planet 3:\n        $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} \\right)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Overall Ratio of Orbital Radii between Planet 3 and Planet 1.**\n    To find the ratio $\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$, we can multiply the two ratios we just found:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n4.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law to find the Ratio of Orbital Periods.**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This can be written as $P \\propto a^{3/2}$.\n\n    The ratio of the orbital periods of Planet 3 and Planet 1 is therefore:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{a_3}{a_1} \\right)^{3/2}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value.**\n    Substitute the value of $\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$ into the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}$\n\n    To compute this, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the semi-major axes a3/a1 has been calculated as 10.3684\na3_over_a1 = 10.3684\n\n# According to Kepler's Third Law, P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2)\nP3_over_P1 = a3_over_a1**(3/2)\n\nprint(P3_over_P1)\n```\n<execute_code>\n33.3862480039583\n</execute_code>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 33.39.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 4.4\nB) ~ 10.4\nC) ~ 33.4\nD) ~ 3.2\n\nThe calculated value of ~33.4 matches option C.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Radius.**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (which is the orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n    *   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n    In this problem, all three planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant. The problem also states that the albedo ($A$) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, all terms except for the orbital radius ($a$) are constant for the system. This leads to the proportionality:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n2.  **Use the given temperature ratios to find the ratios of the orbital radii.**\n    From the proportionality above, we can establish a relationship between the temperatures and orbital radii of any two planets (let's say planet 'i' and planet 'j'):\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{a_i}}{1/\\sqrt{a_j}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_j}{a_i}}$\n\n    By squaring both sides, we can find the ratio of their orbital radii:\n    $\\frac{a_j}{a_i} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}} \\right)^2$\n\n    We are given the following temperature ratios:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = 1.4$\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 2.3$\n\n    Now, we can calculate the ratios of the orbital radii:\n    *   Ratio between Planet 2 and Planet 1:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\right)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96$\n    *   Ratio between Planet 3 and Planet 2:\n        $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} \\right)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29$\n\n3.  **Determine the total ratio of orbital radii between Planet 3 and Planet 1.**\n    To find the factor by which Planet 3's orbit is larger than Planet 1's orbit ($\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$), we can multiply the individual ratios:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n4.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of the orbital periods.**\n    Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period ($P$) is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$) of its orbit, for all planets orbiting the same star.\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This can be expressed as a ratio:\n    $\\left( \\frac{P_3}{P_1} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{a_3}{a_1} \\right)^3$\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods ($\\frac{P_3}{P_1}$), we take the square root of both sides:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{a_3}{a_1} \\right)^{3/2}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the final numerical answer.**\n    We substitute the value of $\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$ we found in step 3 into this equation.
