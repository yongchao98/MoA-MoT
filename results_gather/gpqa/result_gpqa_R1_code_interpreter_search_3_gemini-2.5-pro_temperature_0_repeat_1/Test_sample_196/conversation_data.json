    "**1. Analysis of Compound X's Structure from Spectral Data**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad absorption in the range of `3400–2500 cm-1` is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded in a dimeric form.\n    *   The strong absorption at `1720 cm-1` is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The absorptions at `1610 cm-1` and `1450 cm-1` are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   `10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)`: This broad singlet, highly downfield, corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is due to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is due to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Let's piece together the remaining signals to identify the alkyl substituent.\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives us an ethyl fragment starter: -CH₂-CH₃.\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from our ethyl fragment. It's a multiplet because it's coupled to both the adjacent -CH₃ group (3H) and the methine (-CH-) group (1H).\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). This proton is benzylic (attached to the benzene ring), which explains its downfield shift. It's a multiplet because it's coupled to the adjacent -CH₂- group (2H) and the adjacent -CH₃ group (3H).\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Putting the fragments together: The methine group (-CH-) is attached to the benzene ring, a methyl group (-CH₃), and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This forms a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on the combined spectral data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (B), which is the starting material.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce several functional groups, including aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols, completely to alkanes. Crucially for this problem, it reduces a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Applying the Reaction to Compound X:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The benzene ring and the sec-butyl group at position 4 are stable under these conditions and will not be changed.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule will be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n**3. Identifying the Final Product**\n\nLet's compare our predicted product with the given options:\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect. The carboxylic acid is reduced, not retained.\n*   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect. This is the starting material (Compound X).\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl. No rearrangement occurs.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - **Correct.** This matches the predicted product from the reduction of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "**1. Analysis of Compound X's Structure from Spectral Data**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad absorption in the range of `3400–2500 cm⁻¹` is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp absorption at `1720 cm⁻¹` is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The absorptions at `1610 cm⁻¹` and `1450 cm⁻¹` are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic (benzene) ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The data strongly suggests that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   `10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)`: This is a very downfield, broad singlet. This chemical shift and appearance are definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH), confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: These two signals are in the aromatic region.

It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the adjacent -CH₃ group (3H) and the methine (-CH-) group (1H).\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). This proton is attached directly to the benzene ring (a benzylic position), which explains its relatively downfield shift. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to the adjacent -CH₂- group (2H) and the adjacent -CH₃ group (3H).\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** The methine group (-CH-) is attached to the benzene ring, a methyl group (-CH₃), and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).

This is the starting material, Compound X.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.
