    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, followed by an analysis of its chemical environments.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n\nThis is the α-bromination of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen) is replaced by a bromine atom. The reaction is typically catalyzed by acid or base.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Br₂\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) → Product 2**\n\nThis reaction involves an α-halo ketone treated with a strong base (NaOH). While an elimination reaction to form an enone (cyclohex-2-en-1-one) is possible, a more characteristic reaction under these conditions is the **Favorskii rearrangement**. This rearrangement occurs in α-halo ketones that have an enolizable proton on the other α-carbon.\n\n1.  The hydroxide ion (⁻OH) acts as a base and removes a proton from C6 (the α-carbon not bearing the bromine), forming an enolate.\n2.  The enolate anion then performs an intramolecular S_N2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n3.  The hydroxide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone ring.\n4.  This forms a tetrahedral intermediate, which collapses. The strained cyclopropane ring opens to relieve ring strain. The bond between C1 and C6 breaks, forming a carbanion on C6 (a primary carbanion, which is more stable than the secondary carbanion that would form if the C1-C2 bond broke).\n5.  The carbanion is protonated during workup (or by water in the reaction mixture) to yield a carboxylic acid with a five-membered ring.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n*   **Reagents:** NaOH, heat\n*   **Reaction:** Favorskii Rearrangement\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine → Product 3**\n\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reagents:** SOCl₂, pyridine\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) → Product 4**\n\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used for the selective reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reagent:** LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. The structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the molecule. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (a C_s plane) that passes through the aldehyde group (C-H and C=O bonds), the C1 carbon of the ring (the one attached to the aldehyde), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring. This symmetry plane makes certain atoms and groups chemically equivalent.\n\nWe can count the distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n\n1.  **The aldehydic hydrogen (H-C=O):** This hydrogen is unique in its chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The hydrogen on C1:** This hydrogen is on the carbon atom of the ring attached to the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The hydrogens on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are adjacent to C1. The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, there are two hydrogens. These two hydrogens are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic because of the chiral center at C1 (even though it's a racemate, it creates diastereotopicity locally). One hydrogen is \"cis\" to the aldehyde group, and the other is \"trans\". The \"cis\" hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the \"cis\" hydrogen on C5, and the \"trans\" hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the \"trans\" hydrogen on C5. This gives two distinct sets of hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **The hydrogens on C3 and C4:** These are the remaining two carbons of the ring. The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. This results in two more distinct sets of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n**Total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms:**\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>",

The \"upper\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"upper\" proton on C5, and the \"lower\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"lower\" proton on C5.
