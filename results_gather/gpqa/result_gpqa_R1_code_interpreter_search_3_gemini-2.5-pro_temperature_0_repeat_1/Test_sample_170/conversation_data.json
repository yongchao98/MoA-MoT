    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\n\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-). Substituents determine the rate of reaction and the position (ortho, meta, or para) of the incoming electrophile (Br+).\n\n*   **Activating groups (Electron-Donating Groups, EDG):** These groups increase the electron density of the benzene ring, making it more reactive towards electrophiles than benzene itself. They direct incoming electrophiles to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n*   **Deactivating groups (Electron-Withdrawing Groups, EWG):** These groups decrease the electron density of the ring, making it less reactive. Most deactivating groups direct incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position.\n*   **Halogens:** This is a special class. They are deactivating due to their strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) but are *ortho/para*-directing due to their electron-donating resonance effect (+M).\n\nLet's classify the given substituents:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is a weak activating group and is **ortho/para-directing**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group. The carbonyl (C=O) makes it a deactivating group, and it is **meta-directing**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is a deactivating group but is **ortho/para-directing**.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a nitro group. It is a strong deactivating group and is **meta-directing**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is a weak activating group and is **ortho/para-directing**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. The carbonyl (C=O) makes it a deactivating group, and it is **meta-directing**.\n\n**Step 2: Separate into meta-directing and ortho/para-directing groups**\n\nBased on the classification, we can separate the substances into two groups. The meta-directing groups will produce a very small amount of the para-isomer, while the ortho/para-directing groups will produce a significant amount.\n\n*   **Low para-yield (meta-directors):** Nitrobenzene (4), Ethyl benzoate (2), Benzoic acid (6).\n*   **High para-yield (ortho/para-directors):** Toluene (1), Ethylbenzene (5), Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nThis means the final order will look like (4, 2, 6 in some order) < (1, 5, 3 in some order).\n\n**Step 3: Order the meta-directing substances**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups (4, 2, 6), the yield of the para-isomer will be extremely low. The order of the para-isomer yield will be inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group will reduce the electron density at the ortho and para positions more effectively, leading to an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 (strongest) > -COOH > -COOC2H5 (strong)\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\nC6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)\n\n**Step 4: Order the ortho/para-directing substances**\n\nFor the ortho/para-directing groups (1, 3, 5), the yield of the para-isomer is significant. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution.\n\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3):** The -Cl group is strongly deactivating via induction (-I effect), which is distance-dependent and thus stronger at the ortho positions than the para position. This electronic effect strongly disfavors ortho substitution, leading to a very high yield of the para-isomer (typically around 87%). This will likely be the highest in this group.\n*   **Toluene (1) vs. Ethylbenzene (5):** Both -CH3 and -C2H5 are activating alkyl groups. The primary factor determining the ortho/para ratio between them is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). The larger size of the ethyl group blocks the ortho positions more effectively, thus favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n\nSo, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\n\n**Step 5: Combine the orders**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered lists. The meta-directors have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho/para-directors.\n\nCombining the results from Step 3 and Step 4:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically bromination (using Br+ as the electrophile) on a substituted benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring determines two things:\n*   **Reactivity:** Whether the ring reacts faster or slower than benzene itself.\n*   **Directing Effect:** Where the incoming bromine atom will attach (ortho, meta, or para position).\n\nThe question asks to arrange the substances in order of increasing *weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer*. Since all monobrominated products for a given starting material will have the same molar mass, the order of weight fraction will be the same as the order of the molar percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nWe need to classify each substituent as either activating or deactivating, and as ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups (Electron-Donating Groups - EDG):** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive and directing the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) **-CH3 (methyl):** Weakly activating, ortho/para-directing.\n    *   5) **-C2H5 (ethyl):** Weakly activating, ortho/para-directing.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups (Electron-Withdrawing Groups - EWG):** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive and directing the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5 (ester):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   4) **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   6) **-COOH (carboxylic acid):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho/Para-Directing Group (Halogens):** This is a special case. Halogens are deactivating due to their strong inductive effect but are ortho/para-directing due to their resonance effect.\n    *   3) **-Cl (chloro):** Deactivating, ortho/para-directing.\n\n**3. Separate into Low and High Para-Yield Groups**\n\nBased on the directing effects, we can immediately form two groups:\n\n*   **Low Para-Yield Group (Meta-Directors):** These substances will primarily form the meta-isomer, with only very small amounts of the ortho and para-isomers.\n    *   Substances: 2 (C6H5-COOC2H5), 4 (C6H5-NO2), 6 (C6H5-COOH)\n\n*   **High Para-Yield Group (Ortho/Para-Directors):** These substances will form significant amounts of the para-isomer.\n    *   Substances: 1 (C6H5-CH3), 3 (C6H5-Cl), 5 (C6H5-C2H5)\n\nTherefore, the final order will be `(2, 4, 6 in some order) < (1, 3, 5 in some order)`.\n\n**4. Order the Low Para-Yield Group (Meta-Directors)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer yield is minimal. The yield will be inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group makes the ortho/para positions even less favorable, resulting in a lower para yield.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 (strongest) > -COOH > -COOC2H5 (strong)\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nC6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5\nIn terms of numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**5. Order the High Para-Yield Group (Ortho/Para-Directors)**\n\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho product.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance (Toluene vs. Ethylbenzene):** Both -CH3 and -C2H5 are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the ortho positions more effectively, thus increasing the proportion of the product formed at the less hindered para position.\n    *   Therefore, para yield of Ethylbenzene (5) > para yield of Toluene (1).\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Halogen Effect (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl group is deactivating but ortho/para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is most felt at the ortho positions, making them less reactive than the para position. This electronic effect, combined with steric hindrance, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for alkylbenzenes.\n    *   Typical para yield for bromination of chlorobenzene is ~87%.\n    *   Typical para yield for bromination of toluene is ~67%.\n    *   Typical para yield for bromination of ethylbenzene is ~75%.\n\nCombining these observations, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\nToluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene\nIn terms of numbers: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**6. Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups:\n(Low para-yield group) < (High para-yield group)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",

Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of substituted benzene rings. The substituent on the ring dictates where the incoming bromine atom will attach. We need to arrange the starting materials in order of increasing percentage yield of the *para*-substituted product. Since the molar mass of all monobrominated isomers of a given starting material is the same, the order of weight fraction is identical to the order of molar percentage yield.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent based on its directing effect on the incoming electrophile (Br+).\n\n*   **Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) **-CHโ (Toluene):** Activating group.\n    *   5) **-CโHโ (Ethylbenzene):** Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** Deactivating group, but ortho/para-directing.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position.\n    *   4) **-NOโ (Nitrobenzene):** Strongly deactivating group.\n    *   2) **-COOCโHโ (Ethyl benzoate):** Deactivating group.\n    *   6) **-COOH (Benzoic acid):** Deactivating group.\n\n**3. Initial Grouping**\n\nThe meta-directing substances will produce very little of the para-isomer, as the main product is the meta-isomer. The ortho/para-directing substances will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer. This allows us to create two distinct groups.\n\n*   **Low Para-Yield Group:** 4 (Nitrobenzene), 2 (Ethyl benzoate), 6 (Benzoic acid)\n*   **High Para-Yield Group:** 1 (Toluene), 5 (Ethylbenzene), 3 (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThe final correct sequence will have all the substances from the low-yield group listed before the substances from the high-yield group.\n\n**4. Ordering the Low Para-Yield Group (Meta-Directors)**\n\nWithin this group (4, 2, 6), the yield of the para-isomer is minimal. The order of para-yield will be inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group repels the positive charge of the transition state at the ortho and para positions more effectively, leading to an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NOโ (strongest) > -COOH > -COOCโHโ\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)\nSequence: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**5. Ordering the High Para-Yield Group (Ortho/Para-Directors)**\n\nWithin this group (1, 5, 3), we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho substitution.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** Both -CHโ and -CโHโ are activating alkyl groups.

The inductive effect is strongest at the ortho positions, making them electronically less favorable for attack than the para position. This electronic disfavoring of the ortho position, combined with steric hindrance, results in a very high yield of the para-isomer for chlorobenzene, typically higher than for simple alkylbenzenes.\n    *   Typical para-yields in bromination: Toluene (~67%), Ethylbenzene (~75%), Chlorobenzene (~87%).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\nSequence: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**6.
