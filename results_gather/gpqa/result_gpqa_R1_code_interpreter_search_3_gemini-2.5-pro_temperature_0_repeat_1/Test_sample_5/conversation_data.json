    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 * k * r^2 + 3/2 * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation more easily, we convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The conversion formulas are:\n    x = r * cos(θ)\n    y = r * sin(θ)\n    r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * (r * cos(θ))^2\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * x^2\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Combine the terms with x^2 and y^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 * k * x^2 + 3/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2 * k) * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n4.  **Identify the System:**\n    The potential V(x, y) is the sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where:\n    V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2\n    V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n    This means the system is a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator.
