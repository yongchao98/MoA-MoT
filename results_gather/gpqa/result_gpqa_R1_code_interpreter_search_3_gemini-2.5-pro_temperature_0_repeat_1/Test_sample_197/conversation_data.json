    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the species and equilibria:**\n    The solution contains a central metal ion, Co(II) (`Co²⁺`), and a ligand, thiocyanate (`SCN⁻`). They form a series of complexes. The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species is given by `c(Co)`.\n    The species present are:\n    *   Free `Co²⁺`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂]` (the dithiocyanato complex)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n    The formation of these complexes is governed by the overall stability constants (β):\n    *   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺` ; `β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]` ; `β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 3 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻` ; `β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` ; `β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16`\n\n2.  **Formulate the distribution coefficient (α):**\n    The fraction (or distribution coefficient, α) of any given species is its concentration divided by the total concentration of the central metal ion, `c(Co)`.\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n    We can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free metal ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` and the ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`:\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n    Substituting these into the expression for `c(Co)`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n    The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, which we'll call `α₂`, is:\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n    `α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n3.  **Apply the given concentrations:**\n    We are given `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` and `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. Since the concentration of the ligand `[SCN⁻]` is ten times higher than the total metal concentration `c(Co)`, we can assume that the concentration of the free ligand is approximately equal to its initial total concentration. This is a standard assumption in such problems.\n    So, we use `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. Let's denote this as `L`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the terms:**\n    *   `L = 0.1`\n    *   `β₁L = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β₂L² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   `β₃L³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `β₄L⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n5.  **Calculate the fraction `α₂`:**\n    The numerator is the term for the desired complex: `β₂L² = 0.4`.\n    The denominator is the sum of all terms (including 1 for the free `Co²⁺`):\n    Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n6.  **Convert to percentage:**\n    Percentage = `α₂ * 100 = 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%`\n\n    This value is approximately 16.9%.\n\nTo verify the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# Given values for the stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nL = 0.1  # [SCN-] concentration in M\n\n# Calculate the terms for the denominator of the alpha fraction\nterm0 = 1  # For free Co(II)\nterm1 = beta1 * L\nterm2 = beta2 * L**2\nterm3 = beta3 * L**3\nterm4 = beta4 * L**4\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The numerator for the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is term2\nnumerator_alpha2 = term2\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex\nalpha2 = numerator_alpha2 / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_alpha2 = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage_alpha2)\n```\n<execute_code>\n16.91618032648228\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** We have a central metal ion, Co(II), and a ligand, thiocyanate (SCN⁻). These react to form a series of complexes: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`. The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution is the sum of the free ion and all the complexes.\n\n2.  **Define the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of one specific complex, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (`[Co(SCN)₂]`), relative to the total amount of cobalt in the solution. This is known as the mole fraction or distribution coefficient (`α₂`) of that species, expressed as a percentage.\n\n3.  **Use the Distribution Coefficient Formula:** The fraction of any species `[Co(SCN)ₙ]⁽²⁻ⁿ⁾` (denoted as `αₙ`) in the solution can be calculated using the overall stability constants (`β`) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. The general formula is:\n    `αₙ = (βₙ * [SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n    Note that for the free `Co²⁺` ion (n=0), `β₀` is defined as 1.\n\n4.  **Identify the Target Species:** We are interested in the dithiocyanato complex, which is `[Co(SCN)₂]`. This corresponds to `n=2`. So, we need to calculate `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Check the Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration. We are given the *total* thiocyanate concentration as 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M. Since the ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the metal ion concentration (0.01 M), the amount of ligand that gets bound into complexes will be small compared to the total amount of ligand. Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` as being equal to its total concentration, 0.1 M.\n\n6.  **Plug in the Values and Calculate:**\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   `β₁` = 9\n    *   `β₂` = 40\n    *   `β₃` = 63\n    *   `β₄` = 16\n\n    First, let's calculate each term in the denominator (let's call it `D`):\n    *   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n    Now, sum these terms to get the denominator `D`:\n    `D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    The numerator for `α₂` is the term we calculated for `[Co(SCN)₂]`, which is `0.4`.\n\n    Now, calculate `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n7.  **Convert to Percentage:** To get the percentage, multiply the fraction `α₂` by 100:\n    Percentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, the calculation can be performed with a simple script.\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nligand_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the distribution coefficient formula\n# This represents the sum of the relative amounts of all species\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * ligand_conc**1) + (beta2 * ligand_conc**2) + (beta3 * ligand_conc**3) + (beta4 * ligand_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the target species, [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator_alpha2 = beta2 * ligand_conc**2\n\n# Calculate the fraction (distribution coefficient) of [Co(SCN)2]\nalpha2 = numerator_alpha2 / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_alpha2 = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage_alpha2)\n```\n<execute_code>\n16.91618032648228\n</execute_code>\nThe code confirms the result is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>",

Because the ligand is in large excess, we can approximate the free ligand concentration as being equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n\n*   **Calculate the Numerator:** The term for the desired species `[Co(SCN)₂]` is:\n    `Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n*   **Calculate the Denominator:** The denominator is the sum of the terms for all species (note that the term for the free ion `Co²⁺` is 1):\n    `Denominator = 1 + (β₁[SCN⁻]¹) + (β₂[SCN⁻]²) + (β₃[SCN⁻]³) + (β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n    `Denominator = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n    `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n    `Denominator = 2.3646`\n\n*   **Calculate the Fraction `α₂`:**\n    `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage:**\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100 = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe result matches option C. To verify the calculation, a Python script can be used.\n```python\n# Define the given stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nligand_concentration = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the term in the distribution equation corresponding to the target complex, [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator_term = beta2 * (ligand_concentration**2)\n\n# Calculate the sum of all terms in the distribution equation's denominator\n# This represents the relative total concentration of all cobalt species.\ndenominator_sum = 1 + (beta1 * ligand_concentration**1) + (beta2 * ligand_concentration**2) + (beta3 * ligand_concentration**3) + (beta4 * ligand_concentration**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2) of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nalpha2 = numerator_term / denominator_sum\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<execute_code>\n16.91618032648228\n</execute_code>\nThe code confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
