Is the theory renormalizable?\n\nA) The mass dimension \\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M}=1. The theory is renormalizable.\nB) The mass dimension \\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M}=-1. The theory is renormalizable.\nC) The mass dimension \\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M}=1. The theory is not renormalizable.\nD) The mass dimension \\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M}=-1. The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
