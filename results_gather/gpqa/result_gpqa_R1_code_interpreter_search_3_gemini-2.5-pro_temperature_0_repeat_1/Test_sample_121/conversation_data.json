    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final product and the analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents performs an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid. While the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr3, this is a variation that achieves the same outcome. The reaction substitutes one of the α-hydrogens of acetic acid with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with the alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of an acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (a good leaving group) from the primary carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic cyclization reaction, similar to the malonic ester synthesis for making cyclic compounds.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. This carbon is acidic because the negative charge of the resulting carbanion is stabilized by resonance with both the adjacent cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups.\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂`\n    2.  **First Alkylation (SN2):** The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic α-hydrogen on the newly formed intermediate.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ + H₂`\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization (SN2):** The carbanion on the α-carbon now attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom. This forms a six-membered ring because the ring is composed of the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane chain.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The structure is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n    ```\n          CN\n          |\n      (C1)-COOCH2CH3\n     /   \\\n    (C2)H2 (C6)H2\n    |       |\n    (C3)H2 (C5)H2\n     \\   /\n      (C4)H2\n    ```\n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in the molecule, considering its symmetry.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The time-averaged structure possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Proton Equivalence:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH2-) are enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent and produce **1 signal**.\n        *   Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   **C2 and C6:** These two CH2 groups are equivalent, related by the plane of symmetry. However, within each CH2 group, the two protons (one axial, one equatorial in any given chair conformation) are diastereotopic. They have different chemical environments and are not interchangeable by symmetry or rapid conformational change. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C6 give rise to **2 distinct signals** (each signal integrating to 2H).\n        *   **C3 and C5:** Similar to C2/C6, these two CH2 groups are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons on each carbon are diastereotopic. Thus, the four protons on C3 and C5 produce **2 distinct signals** (each integrating to 2H).\n        *   **C4:** This CH2 group is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic because their relationship to the different substituents (CN vs. COOEt) on C1 is different. They will produce **2 distinct signals** (each integrating to 1H).\n\n3.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 2 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring (C2/C6 + C3/C5 + C4): 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals\n    *   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 signals.**\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>",

The ring consists of the α-carbon plus the five carbons from the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** The final product is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n     \n\n### **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in the final structure, considering its symmetry and conformational dynamics.\n\n1.  **Conformational Analysis:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The two chair conformers (one with CN axial/COOEt equatorial, and the other with CN equatorial/COOEt axial) are diastereomers and are not equally populated. However, the rapid flipping creates a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Symmetry and Equivalence:**\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n\n3.  **Counting the Signals:**\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-O-CH₂-) group are enantiotopic due to the molecule's overall plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. They will produce **1 signal**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** These two carbons are equivalent by symmetry. However, on each carbon, the two protons (the axial and equatorial protons in any given chair conformation) are diastereotopic. They are in different chemical environments and are not interchangeable. Due to the ring's symmetry, the two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-type protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** for the four protons on C2 and C6.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The logic is identical to that for C2 and C6. The four protons on these two carbons will give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C4:** This is the most subtle part. Although a time-averaged plane of symmetry passes through C4, the two protons on C4 are diastereotopic. This is because the two interconverting chair conformations are not equal in energy (since CN and COOEt are different sizes), so they are not equally populated. The time-averaging process for the axial proton and the equatorial proton does not lead to the same average chemical shift. Therefore, the two protons on C4 are chemically distinct and will produce **2 distinct signals**.\n\n4.  **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   Ethyl -CH₃: 1 signal\n    *   Ethyl -OCH₂-: 1 signal\n    *   Ring C2/C6 protons: 2 signals\n    *   Ring C3/C5 protons: 2 signals\n    *   Ring C4 protons: 2 signals\n    *   **Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 signals**\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>",

The key is to consider the molecule's symmetry and conformational dynamics at room temperature.\n\n1.  **Symmetry and Conformation:** The final product, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane, has a stereocenter at C1. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged structure that possesses an *effective* plane of symmetry passing through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This symmetry dictates the equivalence of protons in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n2.  **Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation. They produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are adjacent to the C1 stereocenter, making them technically diastereotopic. However, in the context of problems like this, they are often treated as being rendered equivalent (enantiotopic) by the effective plane of symmetry of the time-averaged molecule. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   The effective plane of symmetry makes the CH₂ group at C2 equivalent to the CH₂ group at C6. It also makes the CH₂ group at C3 equivalent to the CH₂ group at C5.\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** Within each of these CH₂ groups, the two protons (axial and equatorial in any given conformation) are diastereotopic. They are not interchangeable by symmetry or conformational change. The plane of symmetry makes the two \"upper\" protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent, and the two \"lower\" protons equivalent. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C6 give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons are also diastereotopic pairs, resulting in **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the effective plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C4 are diastereotopic. This is because the two chair conformers (one with CN axial/COOEt equatorial, and the other with CN equatorial/COOEt axial) are diastereomers and are not equally populated in energy. The time-averaged chemical shift for each proton is a weighted average of its shift in the axial and equatorial positions. Since the populations are unequal, the two protons will have different time-averaged chemical shifts. Thus, they produce **2 distinct signals**.\n\n3.  **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   Ethyl -CH₃: 1 signal\n    *   Ethyl -OCH₂-: 1 signal\n    *   Ring C2/C6 protons: 2 signals\n    *   Ring C3/C5 protons: 2 signals\n    *   Ring C4 protons: 2 signals\n    *   **Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 signals**\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>",

It also makes the CH₂ group at C3 equivalent to the CH₂ group at C5.\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** Within each of these CH₂ groups, the two protons (the axial and equatorial protons in any given chair conformation) are diastereotopic. They are in different chemical environments and are not interchangeable. Due to the ring's symmetry, the two \"axial-type\" protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two \"equatorial-type\" protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** for the four protons on C2 and C6.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The logic is identical to that for C2 and C6. The four protons on these two carbons will give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the effective plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C4 are diastereotopic. This is because their relationship to the two different substituents on C1 is different. They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. Therefore, they produce **2 distinct signals**.\n\n3.  **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   Ethyl -CH₃: 1 signal\n    *   Ethyl -OCH₂-: 1 signal\n    *   Ring C2/C6 protons: 2 signals\n    *   Ring C3/C5 protons: 2 signals\n    *   Ring C4 protons: 2 signals\n    *   **Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 signals**\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\n\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\n\nIf you lack the related knowledge, you can use the Google Search Tool to search the web and get the information.\nYou can call a search query with the format of <search>your search query</search>, e.g., <search>Who is the current president of US?</search>. The searched results will be returned between <information> and </information>.\nOnce the search query is complete, stop the generation. Then, the search platform will return the searched results.\n\nIf you need to search the web, do not generate code in the same response. Vice versa. You can also solve the question without code and searching, just by your textual reasoning.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code or search queries to solve the problem.\n\n    question: acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.\n\n1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.\n\n3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.\n\nhow many distinct hydrogen signals will be observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of 4?
