    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the mean decay distance (or mean decay length) of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   Production energy of the meson, $E_X = 8$ GeV.\n    *   Mass of the meson, $m_X = 1.2$ GeV (in natural units, this is $m_X c^2$).\n    *   Decay width of the meson, $\\Gamma_X = 320$ MeV.\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   The mean decay distance ($d$) is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$).\n        $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n    *   Due to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) by a factor of the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n        $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    *   The proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ is related to the decay width $\\Gamma_X$ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n        $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   The velocity is $v = \\beta c$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\beta$ is the speed as a fraction of $c$.\n    *   Combining these, the mean decay distance is:\n        $d = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n4.  **Develop a Calculation Strategy:**\n    A more direct formula can be derived using relativistic kinematics. The momentum $p$ of the particle is related to its energy and mass by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$. The momentum is also given by $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m \\beta c$.\n    From this, we can write $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2}$.\n    Substituting this into the expression for the decay distance:\n    $d = (\\gamma \\beta) c \\tau_0 = \\left(\\frac{pc}{m_X c^2}\\right) c \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}\\right) = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    This formula is convenient because it uses quantities that are easily calculated from the given values and fundamental constants in standard particle physics units.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculations:**\n\n    *   **Convert units:** It's best to work with consistent units.

Identify the Relevant Physical Principles**\n*   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$):** The lifetime of an unstable particle in its own rest frame (its proper lifetime) is inversely proportional to its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$). This relationship comes from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle ($\\Delta E \\Delta t \\ge \\hbar/2$). For a large number of decays, the relation is given by:\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** A moving clock runs slower. Because the meson X is moving at a relativistic speed in the lab, its lifetime as measured in the lab ($\\tau_{lab}$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$).

Combine the Formulas into a Practical Equation**\nWe can combine these principles to derive a single formula that uses the given quantities.\n1.  Start with the definition of distance: $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n2.  Substitute the time-dilated lifetime: $d = v \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0)$\n3.  Substitute the expression for proper lifetime: $d = v \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n4.  The term $v\\gamma$ can be expressed more conveniently. We know the relativistic momentum is $p = \\gamma m_X v$. Rearranging gives $v\\gamma = p/m_X$.\n5.

This is the average distance the particle travels after its creation before it decays.\n\n### 2. Identify the Relevant Physical Principles\nThe calculation involves several key concepts from special relativity and particle physics:\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$):** An unstable particle's intrinsic lifetime (in its own rest frame) is determined by its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$). The relationship is derived from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $$ \\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} $$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. A larger width implies a shorter lifetime.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the laboratory, the moving particle's internal clock runs slow. Its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is longer than its proper lifetime by a factor of $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor):\n    $$ \\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0 $$\n\n*   **Mean Decay Distance ($d$):** The distance is the particle's velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lifetime in the lab:\n    $$ d = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} $$\n\n### 3.

Substitute the expressions for $\\tau_{lab}$ and $\\tau_0$:\n    $d = v \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = v \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n3.  In relativistic mechanics, the momentum is $p = \\gamma m v$. We can write this as $v\\gamma = p/m$.\n4.  Substituting this into the equation for distance gives:\n    $d = \\frac{p}{m_X} \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n5.  For convenience in particle physics, we work with energy units (like GeV) and use quantities like $pc$ and $m_X c^2$.
