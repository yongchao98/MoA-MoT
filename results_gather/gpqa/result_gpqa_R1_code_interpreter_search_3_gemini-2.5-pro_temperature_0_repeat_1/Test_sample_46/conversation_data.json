    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   First, calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    *   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O), which accounts for the fifth degree.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for a conjugated ester. It is generally too high for an amide (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹) and a bit low for a simple saturated ester (usually ~1735-1750 cm⁻¹), but conjugation with a benzene ring lowers the frequency into this range.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is the first part of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). This confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm strongly suggests this methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The protons are exchangeable, which causes the signal to be broad. The chemical shift is consistent with an amino group attached to an aromatic ring.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The doublet at the more downfield position (8.0 ppm) corresponds to the protons ortho (adjacent) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester carbonyl).\n    *   The doublet at the more upfield position (7.0 ppm) corresponds to the protons ortho to an electron-donating group (like the amino group).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure**\n\n*   From the DoU and NMR, we have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   From the IR and NMR, one substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   From the IR and NMR, the other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   Placing these groups in a 1,4 (para) arrangement on the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. Incorrect.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: a primary amine, a conjugated ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted ring with the correct electronic effects reflected in the NMR shifts. Correct.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, but the C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹). Also, the 1,3- (meta) substitution would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets. Incorrect.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the acyl portion (CH₃CH₂-C=O). The -CH₂- group would be a quartet around 2.2-2.5 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n\nThe only compound that fits all the provided data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get an initial idea of the structure.\n*   The formula for DoU is: `C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)` where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which accounts for the fifth degree.\n\n**2.
