    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol (for the most abundant isotopes).\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (since the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75% and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n\n**Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When considered with the broad O-H peak, it strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (deshielded) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). Its integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (s, as it does not couple with other protons) confirms this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic indicator of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the *para* substitution makes the two protons ortho to one group equivalent and the two protons ortho to the other group equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Options:**\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed structures based on the combined evidence. The molecular formula for a chlorobenzoic acid is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   Molecular Weight = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + 35.5 + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5. This matches the mass spectrum.\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. The NMR would be much more complex and would lack the characteristic carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in a *para* arrangement on a benzene ring. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the spectral data:\n    *   **MS:** MW of 156.5 and contains one Cl atom.\n    *   **IR:** Contains a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Has a carboxylic acid proton and shows the characteristic two-doublet pattern for a *para*-substituted ring.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While this is a chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are in the *ortho* position. This lack of symmetry would result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, creating a complex multiplet in the NMR spectrum, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe only structure that fits all the provided spectral evidence is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 is the base peak (100% intensity). This indicates the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotopes is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (two mass units higher) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 100:32 (or ~3:1) is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single **chlorine** atom (natural abundance: ³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n\n**Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The significant broadening is due to extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When considered with the broad O-H peak, it strongly confirms the presence of a **carboxylic acid** functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (11.0 ppm):** A signal this far downfield (highly deshielded) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** The signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Splitting (s, singlet):** It does not couple with other protons, which is typical for an acidic proton. This confirms the carboxylic acid.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.7-8.0 ppm):** These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H):** There are a total of four protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Splitting (d, doublet each):** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indicator of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of this substitution pattern results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Evidence and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   We have a benzene ring with two substituents: a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group.\n*   The ¹H NMR data clearly indicates these two groups are in a *para* (1,4) position relative to each other.\n*   This leads to the structure of **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect functional groups (aldehyde and phenol, not a carboxylic acid) and substitution pattern.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: it's a carboxylic acid, it contains one chlorine, its molecular weight is 156 (for ³⁵Cl), and it has a *para*-substituted ring that would produce the observed ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect functional group (an acid chloride/ester). It would not have the broad O-H peak in the IR or the acidic proton at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While this is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* substitution would create four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex ¹H NMR spectrum, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>",
