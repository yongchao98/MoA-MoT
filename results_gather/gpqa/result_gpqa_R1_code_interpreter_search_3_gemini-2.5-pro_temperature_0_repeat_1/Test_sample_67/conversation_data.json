    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment is given by the vector operator `μ = γ * S`, where `S` is the spin operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, the magnetic field is `B_initial = B * ẑ` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian of the system is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -γ * (S · B * ẑ) = -γ * B * Sz`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned with the magnetic field,\" which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of this Hamiltonian.\n*   The eigenstates of `Sz` are spin-up `|+z>` (with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (with eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γ * B * (ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γ * B * (ħ/2)`.\n*   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state, `|+z>`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to `B_new = B * ŷ` (pointing in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ · B_new = -γ * (S · B * ŷ) = -γ * B * Sy`.\n*   The state of the particle will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, governed by this new Hamiltonian:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γ * B * Sy) * t / ħ) |+z>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γ * B * Sy * t / ħ) |+z>`\n\n### 3. Express the Initial State in the New Basis\n\n*   To calculate the effect of the time evolution operator `exp(i * γ * B * Sy * t / ħ)`, it is easiest to work in the eigenbasis of `Sy`.\n*   The eigenstates of `Sy` are `|+y>` and `|-y>`, with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`, respectively.\n*   We need to express the initial state `|+z>` in terms of `|+y>` and `|-y>`. The relationship between the bases is:\n    `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n    `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n*   By adding these two equations, we can solve for `|+z>`:\n    `|+y> + |-y> = (1/√2) * (2 * |+z>)`\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n*   So, the initial state is `|ψ(0)> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n\n### 4. Apply the Time Evolution Operator\n\n*   Now we apply the time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(i * γ * B * Sy * t / ħ)` to the initial state. Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are eigenstates of `Sy`:\n    `U(t)|+y> = exp(i * γ * B * (ħ/2) * t / ħ) |+y> = exp(i * γ * B * t / 2) |+y>`\n    `U(t)|-y> = exp(i * γ * B * (-ħ/2) * t / ħ) |-y> = exp(-i * γ * B * t / 2) |-y>`\n*   Let's define the angular frequency `ω_0 = γ * B / 2`. The evolution of the state is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)> = (1/√2) * [U(t)|+y> + U(t)|-y>]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(i * ω_0 * t) |+y> + exp(-i * ω_0 * t) |-y>]`\n\n### 5.

We need to calculate `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`.\n*   To do this, it's convenient to express `|ψ(t)>` back in the `Sz` basis (`|+z>`, `|-z>`).\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(iω_0t) * (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + exp(-iω_0t) * (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>)]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [(exp(iω_0t) + exp(-iω_0t))|+z> + i(exp(iω_0t) - exp(-iω_0t))|-z>]`\n*   Using Euler's formulas, `cos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2` and `sin(x) = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i)`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [2*cos(ω_0t)|+z> + i(2i*sin(ω_0t))|-z>]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(ω_0t)|+z> - sin(ω_0t)|-z>`\n*   Now we can calculate `<Sz>(t)`:\n    `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`\n    `<Sz>(t) = (cos(ω_0t)<+z| - sin(ω_0t)<-z|) * Sz * (cos(ω_0t)|+z> - sin(ω_0t)|-z>)`\n    Since `Sz|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `Sz|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`,\n    `<Sz>(t) = (cos(ω_0t)<+z| - sin(ω_0t)<-z|) * ( (ħ/2)cos(ω_0t)|+z> + (ħ/2)sin(ω_0t)|-z> )`\n*   Using the orthogonality of the basis states (`<+z|+z>=1`, `<+z|-z>=0`, etc.):\n    `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ω_0t) - sin²(ω_0t))`\n*   Using the double-angle identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`:\n    `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(2ω_0t)`\n\n### 6. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\n\n*   The average of the z-component of the spin, `<Sz>(t)`, oscillates with an angular frequency of `Ω = 2ω_0`.\n*   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μz>(t) = γ * <Sz>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(2ω_0t)`. This also oscillates with the same angular frequency `Ω`.\n*   Substituting our definition of `ω_0 = γ * B / 2`:\n    `Ω = 2 * (γ * B / 2) = γ * B`\n*   This frequency `Ω = γ * B` is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γ * B`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The system is a spin-1/2 particle, so its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (a spinor).\n*   The magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin operator `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component is `μz = γSz`.\n*   Initially, the magnetic field is `B_initial = B * ẑ` (in the +z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian of the particle in this field is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -γS · (B * ẑ) = -γB * Sz`.\n*   The eigenstates of this Hamiltonian are the eigenstates of `Sz`, which are spin-up `|+z>` and spin-down `|-z>`. Their corresponding eigenvalues for `Sz` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n*   The energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   The problem states the particle is \"aligned with the magnetic field,\" which means it is in the lowest energy state (the ground state). Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy is `E_up`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is the spin-up state along the z-axis: `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2.

    "This is a classic problem of Larmor precession in quantum mechanics. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution.\n\n### 1. Determine the Initial State (at t=0)\n\n*   The system is a spin-1/2 particle. Its magnetic moment `μ` is proportional to its spin `S`, given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, the magnetic field is `B_initial = B * ẑ` (pointing in the +z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian of the particle in this field is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -γ(S · B * ẑ) = -γB * Sz`.\n*   The problem states the particle's moment is \"aligned with the magnetic field\". This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of this Hamiltonian.\n*   The eigenstates of the `Sz` operator are spin-up `|+z>` (with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (with eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is `E_up`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. Determine the Hamiltonian for t > 0\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to `B_new = B * ŷ` (pointing in the +y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the system's evolution for `t > 0` is:\n    `H = -μ · B_new = -γ(S · B * ŷ) = -γB * Sy`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Time Evolution of the State\n\nThe state of the particle evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\nSubstituting the new Hamiltonian and the initial state:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB * Sy)t / ħ) |+z> = exp(iγB * Sy * t / ħ) |+z>`\n\nTo evaluate this expression, it is most convenient to work in the eigenbasis of `Sy`.\n*   The eigenstates of `Sy` are `|+y>` and `|-y>`, with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2` respectively.\n*   We express the initial state `|+z>` as a superposition of these `Sy` eigenstates:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n*   Now we apply the time evolution operator. Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are eigenstates of `Sy`, the operator `exp(iγB * Sy * t / ħ)` acts on them simply by multiplying by a phase factor corresponding to their energy:\n    `exp(iγB*Sy*t/ħ) |+y> = exp(iγB(ħ/2)t/ħ) |+y> = exp(iγBt/2) |+y>`\n    `exp(iγB*Sy*t/ħ) |-y> = exp(iγB(-ħ/2)t/ħ) |-y> = exp(-iγBt/2) |-y>`\n*   Applying this to our initial state superposition:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(iγBt/2) |+y> + exp(-iγBt/2) |-y> ]`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Moment\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment. This is the expectation value `<μz>(t) = γ<Sz>(t)`. We need to calculate `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`.\n\n*   To do this, we can express `|ψ(t)>` back in the `Sz` basis (`|+z>`, `|-z>`). Using the relations `|+y> = (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>)` and `|-y> = (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>)`, we get:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [ (e^(iγBt/2) + e^(-iγBt/2))|+z> + i(e^(iγBt/2) - e^(-iγBt/2))|-z> ]`\n*   Using Euler's formulas (`cos(θ) = (e^(iθ)+e^(-iθ))/2` and `sin(θ) = (e^(iθ)-e^(-iθ))/(2i)`), this simplifies to:\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n*   Now, we compute the expectation value `<Sz>(t)`:\n    `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`\n    `<Sz>(t) = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * Sz * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n*   Since `Sz|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `Sz|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`, and using the orthogonality of the basis states (`<+z|+z>=1`, `<+z|-z>=0`, etc.), the calculation yields:\n    `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n*   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n    `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * (γBt/2)) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n### 5. Identify the Oscillation Frequency\n\n*   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μz>(t) = γ<Sz>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n*   The time-dependent part of this expression is `cos(γBt)`. The general form for an oscillation is `A*cos(ωt)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n*   By comparing our result with the general form, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation as:\n    `ω = γB`\n\nThis frequency is known as the Larmor frequency. It is the frequency at which the expectation value of the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field.\n\n<<<C>>>"
