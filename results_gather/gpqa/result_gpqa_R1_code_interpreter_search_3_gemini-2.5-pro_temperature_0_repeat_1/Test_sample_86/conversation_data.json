    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Information from the Question**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached to it.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring itself has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 total C - 6 ring C = 2 substituent C).\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This is a crucial piece of information. It means a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, or I) is bonded *directly* to one of the carbons of the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Determine the Structure of the Compound**\n\nBased on the information above, let's figure out the two substituents.\n*   **Substituent 1**: A halogen atom (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n*   **Substituent 2**: This substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group (C=O). The only common chemical group that fits this description is an **acetyl group** (-COCH3).\n\nSo, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its general structure is a benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3). The molecular formula is C8H7OX.\n\nNow, we need to consider the relative positions of these two substituents on the ring (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the Proposed Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the expected signals in the 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is attached to an aromatic ring, is typically in the range of **2.2-2.6 ppm**.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (-C6H4-)**: There are 4 protons on the di-substituted ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern:\n    *   **Para-substitution (1,4-disubstitution)**: This is the most symmetrical arrangement. It results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This typically produces a characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. The signals are in the aromatic region, typically **7.0-8.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Ortho- and Meta-substitution**: These arrangements are less symmetrical and would result in more complex splitting patterns (e.g., four separate signals, multiplets) for the 4 aromatic protons.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options**\n\nLet's compare our prediction with the choices provided.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at **9.9 ppm** is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**, not a ketone. Our compound is a ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signals at **4.8 ppm** and **4.6 ppm** are not in the typical chemical shift range for aromatic protons (which is ~6.5-8.5 ppm). This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Similar to option B, the signals at **4.8 ppm** and **4.6 ppm** are outside the standard aromatic proton region. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`**: This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the expected signal for the **-COCH3** group.\n    *   **`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`**: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, in the aromatic region is the classic signature of a **para-substituted** benzene ring.\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is a para-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data in option D accurately describes this structure, satisfying all the conditions given in the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the molecular formula and functional groups.**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which is a benzene ring (C6) with two groups attached.\n    *   It contains \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n    *   The FTIR spectrum also shows an \"aromatic-halogen bond,\" meaning a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, I) is bonded directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Step 2: Deduce the structure of the substituents.**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The only common functional group that fits this description is an **acetyl group** (-COCH3).\n\n*   **Step 3: Assemble the molecular structure.**\n    *   The molecule is an acetophenone ring substituted with a halogen. The general name is **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7OX.\n    *   The two substituents (-X and -COCH3) are on a benzene ring. We need to determine their relative positions (ortho, meta, or para) by analyzing the NMR data.\n\n*   **Step 4: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the possible isomers.**\n    *   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3):** Regardless of the substitution pattern, the three protons on the methyl group are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. They will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl on a benzene ring (Ar-CO-CH3) is around **2.2-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (-C6H4-):** There are 4 protons on the disubstituted ring. Their splitting pattern is highly dependent on the substitution pattern.\n        *   **Para-substitution (1,4-):** This is a highly symmetrical arrangement. It creates two sets of equivalent protons. This typically results in a clean pattern of **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. These signals appear in the aromatic region, generally between 7.0 and 8.0 ppm.\n        *   **Ortho- (1,2-) and Meta- (1,3-) substitution:** These arrangements are less symmetrical and would produce more complex splitting patterns for the 4 aromatic protons, often resulting in four distinct signals or overlapping multiplets.\n\n*   **Step 5: Evaluate the given 1H NMR options.**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a ketone. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical aromatic proton region (~6.5-8.5 ppm). The signal at 1.3 ppm is a singlet for 2H, which does not match our expected 3H singlet for the acetyl group. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   Again, the signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the aromatic region. While there is a 3H singlet, its chemical shift of 1.3 ppm is too low for a methyl ketone attached to a benzene ring. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`:** This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the expected signal for the **-COCH3** group in terms of chemical shift, integration, and splitting.\n        *   **`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`:** This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, in the aromatic region is the classic signature of a **para-substituted** benzene ring.\n        *   This option is fully consistent with the structure of a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Decipher the Information Provided:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two other groups attached.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 total C - 6 ring C = 2 substituent C).\n*   **\"FTIR ... presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR ... presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is bonded directly to one of the carbons of the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   Let's identify the two substituents based on the clues.\n    *   **Substituent 1**: A halogen atom (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Substituent 2**: This substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group (C=O). The only common chemical group that fits this description is an **acetyl group** (-COCH₃).\n*   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. It consists of a benzene ring with an acetyl group and a halogen atom attached.\n\n**3. Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n\nNow, let's think about what the ¹H NMR spectrum of a haloacetophenone would look like.\n\n*   **The Acetyl Group (-COCH₃):** The three protons on this methyl group are equivalent and are not adjacent to any other protons, so they won't be split. They will appear as a **singlet (s)** that integrates to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is in turn attached to an aromatic ring, is typically in the range of **2.2-2.6 ppm**.\n*   **The Aromatic Protons (-C₆H₄-):** There are 4 protons on the di-substituted ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the relative positions of the two substituents (ortho, meta, or para).\n    *   **Para-substitution (1,4-disubstitution):** This is the most symmetrical arrangement. It results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This produces a characteristic and clean pattern of **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**.
