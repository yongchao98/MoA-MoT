    "*   **Analysis of the Observations:**\n    1.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The key observation is two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this means the proton exists in two different chemical environments. The fact that the integrals are roughly equal and sum to the expected 1H indicates there are two distinct species present in an approximately 1:1 ratio, and both species contain this alpha-proton.\n    2.  **LC-MS Analysis:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude mixture into two distinct peaks. This confirms the presence of two different chemical species that can be separated based on their physical properties (e.g., polarity). The mass spectrometry (MS) analysis shows that both peaks have the same mass spectrum, and this mass is consistent with the expected product. This means the two species are isomers – they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight but different structures.\n    3.  **Nature of the Compound:** The compound is a \"small peptidic compound.\" Peptides are polymers of amino acids linked by amide bonds. A key feature of amide bonds is restricted rotation due to partial double-bond character.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the Options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and on a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single set of NMR peaks and a single peak on the LC. This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, they would give different NMR spectra. It is expected that they would show two sets of peaks for corresponding protons, which is consistent with the observation of two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard chromatography (like reverse-phase LC). This would result in two distinct peaks, as observed. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular weight, which is consistent with both peaks having the same mass spectrum.\n        *   **Source in Peptides:** A very common source of diastereoisomerism in peptides is *cis/trans* isomerism about the amide (peptide) bond. While most peptide bonds strongly favor the *trans* conformation, the bond preceding a proline residue (an X-Pro bond) has a much lower energy barrier to rotation, and significant populations of both *cis* and *trans* isomers can exist at equilibrium. These isomers are diastereomers (also called rotamers) and interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale, giving rise to two sets of peaks for adjacent protons. This phenomenon perfectly explains all the observations. Another possibility is the use of a non-enantiomerically pure amino acid during synthesis, which would also create diastereomers.\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would result in a product with a higher molecular weight than the expected molecule (e.g., Peptide-AA instead of Peptide). The MS data shows that both peaks have the mass of the *expected* molecule, ruling out this option.\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor (a starting material) would have a different chemical structure and, almost certainly, a different molecular weight than the final product. The MS data, showing both peaks have the mass of the product, rules out this option.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of two species that are separable by LC but have the same mass points directly to a mixture of isomers. The fact that they give distinct NMR signals rules out enantiomers (in an achiral environment). Therefore, the species must be diastereomers. The most common and likely explanation for this specific set of observations in a peptide is the presence of *cis* and *trans* rotamers around a peptide bond, which are a type of diastereomer.\n\n<<<B>>>",

The total amount of the proton is correct.\n        *   **Observation:** Spin-spin coupling is ruled out.\n        *   **Implication:** The splitting is not due to coupling with a neighboring proton. The two peaks represent two distinct species.\n    *   **LC-MS Data:**\n        *   **Observation:** Two clearly defined peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace.\n        *   **Implication:** The crude compound contains two distinct chemical species that have different physical properties (e.g., polarity) and can be separated by the LC column.\n        *   **Observation:** The two LC peaks have equal intensities.\n        *   **Implication:** The two species are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio, which corroborates the NMR data.\n        *   **Observation:** Both peaks have the same mass spectrum (MS), which is consistent with the expected molecule.\n        *   **Implication:** This is the most critical piece of information. The two species are **isomers** – they have the exact same chemical formula and molecular weight, but a different arrangement of atoms in space. This rules out impurities that are not isomers of the product.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Implications:**\n    *   We have a ~1:1 mixture of two compounds.\n    *   These two compounds are isomers of the expected product.\n    *   These isomers are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and on a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They have identical physical properties (except for the rotation of plane-polarized light) and identical NMR spectra.\n        *   This would result in a single NMR peak (for the alpha-proton) and a single LC peak.\n        *   This option is **inconsistent** with both the NMR (two peaks) and LC (two peaks) data.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other.\n        *   They have different physical properties (melting point, boiling point, polarity, etc.) and different chemical properties.\n        *   Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard chromatography (LC). This would produce two peaks, which is **consistent** with the LC data.\n        *   Because they are chemically distinct, their corresponding protons are in different chemical environments and will have different chemical shifts in an NMR spectrum. This would produce two sets of peaks, which is **consistent** with the observation of two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   As isomers, they have the same molecular weight. This is **consistent** with both LC peaks giving the same mass spectrum.\n        *   A very common source of diastereomerism in peptides is the presence of *cis* and *trans* isomers (rotamers) about the amide bond, especially the bond preceding a proline residue. These rotamers interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale, giving rise to two distinct sets of signals. This scenario perfectly explains all the observations.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This refers to a side reaction where, for example, an extra amino acid is added.\n        *   The resulting product would have a different chemical formula and a higher molecular weight than the expected molecule.\n        *   The MS data shows that the mass is consistent with the *expected* molecule, not a heavier one.\n        *   This option is **inconsistent** with the MS data.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor (a starting material for the synthesis) would have a different chemical structure and, almost certainly, a different molecular weight than the final product.\n        *   The MS data shows both peaks have the same mass, and it is the mass of the final product. A precursor would not have the same mass as the product.\n        *   This option is **inconsistent** with the MS data.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only explanation that fits all the experimental evidence is that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers. They are isomers (same mass), but are chemically and physically distinct, leading to separation on LC and distinct signals in the NMR.\n\n<<<B>>>",
