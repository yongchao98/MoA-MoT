    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and Reagent**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The core is a `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`, which is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons, C1 and C6.\n    *   There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S). We need to determine the 3D structure from this name. Let's draw a planar representation of the ring and use wedges (up, beta) and dashes (down, alpha) to represent the stereochemistry. We will assume the bulky epoxide oxygen is on the 'up' (beta) face.\n\n*   **Determining the stereochemistry of substituents:** We apply the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to determine the orientation of each substituent that matches the given R/S configuration.\n    *   **At C1 (must be R):** The groups are O(epoxide), C6, C2, and a methyl group. Priorities are O > C6 > C2 > Me. With the O being 'up' (beta), for the configuration to be R, the lowest priority group (Me) must be pointing 'down' (alpha, dashed).\n    *   **At C6 (must be S):** The groups are O(epoxide), C1, C5, and H. Priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. With the O being 'up' (beta), for the configuration to be S, the lowest priority group (H) must be pointing 'down' (alpha, dashed).\n    *   **At C3 (must be R):** The groups are C4, C2, Me, and H. Priorities are C4 (substituted with Me) > C2 (unsubstituted) > Me > H. For the configuration to be R, if we place H 'up' (beta, wedge), the path C4 -> C2 -> Me is counter-clockwise. A counter-clockwise path with the lowest priority group pointing towards the viewer gives an R configuration. So, the C3-Me must be 'down' (alpha, dashed).\n    *   **At C4 (must be R):** The groups are C3, C5, Me, and H. Priorities are C3 (substituted with Me) > C5 (unsubstituted) > Me > H. For the configuration to be R, if we place H 'down' (alpha, dashed), the path C3 -> C5 -> Me is clockwise. A clockwise path with the lowest priority group pointing away gives an R configuration. So, the C4-Me must be 'up' (beta, wedge).\n\n*   **Summary of Reactant Structure:**\n    *   Epoxide oxygen: beta (up)\n    *   C1-Methyl: alpha (down)\n    *   C3-Methyl: alpha (down)\n    *   C4-Methyl: beta (up)\n    *   C6-Hydrogen: alpha (down)\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate or Gilman reagent). This reagent provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction Mechanism**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem states that with organocuprates, \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less hindered carbon, and the nucleophilic attack will occur here.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The problem states, \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This describes a classic Sₙ2-type reaction.\n    *   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the carbon from the side opposite to the leaving group (the epoxide oxygen).\n    *   Since the epoxide oxygen is on the beta face (up), the methyl nucleophile will attack C6 from the alpha face (down).\n    *   This backside attack causes a Walden inversion at C6: the substituents on C6 (in this case, the hydrogen) will flip from their original position. The H at C6 was alpha (down), so it will be pushed to the beta (up) position in the product.\n    *   The C6-O bond breaks, and after an acidic workup (which is implicit), the epoxide oxygen at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n**3. Determine the Product Structure and Name**\n\n*   **Connectivity:** The reaction opens the epoxide ring to form a cyclohexanol.\n    *   The -OH group is at C1.\n    *   There are now four methyl groups: the original ones at C1, C3, and C4, and the new one at C6.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The stereocenters at C1, C3, and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their absolute configurations remain unchanged.\n    *   **At C1:** The original C1-Me is alpha (down). The new -OH group is beta (up). The configuration remains **R**.\n    *   **At C3:** The C3-Me is alpha (down). The configuration remains **R**.\n    *   **At C4:** The C4-Me is beta (up). The configuration remains **R**.\n    *   **At C6 (the site of attack):** The new methyl group adds from the alpha face (down). The original H atom is inverted to the beta face (up). The absolute configuration at this center, which was S in the reactant, has undergone geometric inversion.\n*   **IUPAC Naming of the Product:**\n    1.  **Parent Chain:** The product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n    2.  **Numbering:** The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n        *   Substituents are at the positions corresponding to old C1, C6, C3, and C4.\n        *   If we number clockwise from the OH-bearing carbon (old C1), the methyl groups are at positions 1, 2 (from old C6), 4 (from old C4), and 5 (from old C3). The locant set is (1, 2, 4, 5).\n        *   If we number counter-clockwise, the locants would be (1, 3, 4, 6).\n        *   Comparing (1,2,4,5) and (1,3,4,6), the first set is lower. So, the correct numbering is clockwise.\n    3.  **Product Name Stem:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options B and D.\n*   **Determining the Final Stereochemistry:** We need to find the R/S configuration for each stereocenter in the product using the new numbering.\n    *   **New C1 (Old C1):** Configuration is unchanged. It is **1R**.\n    *   **New C2 (Old C6):** This center underwent inversion. The reactant C6 was S. Geometric inversion (Sₙ2) occurs. We must determine the R/S descriptor of the resulting center.\n        *   Groups: C1, C3(ring), Me, H. Arrangement: Me is alpha (down), H is beta (up).\n        *   Priorities: C1(-OH) > C3(-CH₂) > Me > H.\n        *   With the lowest priority group (H) pointing up (towards the viewer), the path from C1 -> C3 -> Me is clockwise. A clockwise path with H pointing towards the viewer corresponds to an **S** configuration.\n        *   *Note:* This is a case where geometric inversion (Sₙ2 attack) leads to retention of the stereochemical descriptor (S → S) due to changes in CIP priorities. The phrase \"inversion of configuration\" refers to the geometric process.\n        *   So, the configuration is **2S**.\n    *   **New C4 (Old C4):** Configuration is unchanged. It is **4R**.\n    *   **New C5 (Old C3):** Configuration is unchanged. It is **5R**.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and Reagent**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The core structure is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   There are methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S). We need to determine the 3D structure from this name. A detailed analysis of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules for the given name reveals the specific orientation of each group. However, for this problem, we can rely on the principle that stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction will retain their absolute configuration (R/S descriptor).\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent. This reagent acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction Mechanism**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. Organocuprates are excellent reagents for this transformation.\n\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem explicitly states a key rule for this reaction: *\"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"*\n    *   The epoxide is formed across C1 and C6.\n    *   Carbon C1 is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to the epoxide oxygen, a methyl group, and two other ring carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   Carbon C6 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to the epoxide oxygen, a hydrogen atom, and two other ring carbons (C1 and C5).\n    *   Comparing a quaternary carbon to a tertiary carbon, **C6 is the less sterically hindered position**. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The problem provides the second key rule: *\"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"*\n    *   This describes a classic Sₙ2 (bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) mechanism. The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbon (C6) from the side opposite to the leaving group (the C6-O epoxide bond). This is known as backside attack.\n    *   This backside attack causes a Walden inversion at the C6 stereocenter.\n\n**3. Determine the Product Structure and Name**\n\n1.  **Connectivity:** The reaction opens the epoxide ring. The nucleophilic methyl group forms a new bond with C6. The C6-O bond breaks, and the epoxide oxygen remains attached to C1. After an acidic workup (which is implicit in such reactions), this oxygen becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with four methyl groups.\n\n2.  **IUPAC Naming:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), so the carbon it's attached to (the original C1) becomes C1 of the product.\n    *   We number the ring to give the substituents (the methyl groups) the lowest possible locants. The methyl groups are on the carbons that were C1, C6, C3, and C4 in the reactant.\n    *   Numbering clockwise from the OH-bearing carbon gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2 (from old C6), 4 (from old C4), and 5 (from old C3). The locant set is (1, 2, 4, 5).\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise gives locants (1, 3, 4, 6).\n    *   The set (1, 2, 4, 5) is lower, so the correct base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters at the original C1, C3, and C4 are not directly attacked. In the context of this type of problem, we assume their absolute R/S configurations are retained.\n        *   The configuration at the new C1 (from reactant C1) remains **R**.\n        *   The configuration at the new C4 (from reactant C4) remains **R**.\n        *   The configuration at the new C5 (from reactant C3) remains **R**.\n    *   **Reaction Center:** The configuration at the new C2 (from reactant C6) is the result of the Sₙ2 reaction. The reactant's C6 had an **S** configuration. An Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion. We must determine the R/S descriptor of the new stereocenter. A detailed analysis shows that due to changes in CIP priorities when the epoxide oxygen is replaced by a methyl group, a geometric inversion from S can result in a product that is also S.\n        *   Reactant C6 (S) undergoes inversion to become Product C2. Calculation shows the new center is **S**.\n    *   **Assembling the full name:** Combining the retained and newly formed configurations gives **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe predicted product name is (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",

This immediately eliminates options B and D, which have a different substitution pattern.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The stereocenters that are not directly involved in the bond-making or bond-breaking process (original C1, C3, and C4) retain their absolute configurations.\n    *   The configuration at the new **C1** (from reactant C1) remains **R**.\n    *   The configuration at the new **C4** (from reactant C4) remains **R**.\n    *   The configuration at the new **C5** (from reactant C3) remains **R**.\n    *   The configuration at the new **C2** (from reactant C6) is the result of the Sₙ2 inversion. The reactant's C6 had an **S** configuration. The geometric inversion (backside attack) will determine the new stereochemistry. A detailed analysis of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities before and after the reaction shows that the resulting C2 center has an **S** configuration. (Note: A geometric inversion does not always lead to an R/S flip if the substituent priorities change).\n    *   Combining these stereochemical descriptors gives the full IUPAC name: **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe predicted product matches the name given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
