For a planet with mass `M_p` orbiting a star of mass `M_s` with a period `P`, the law is:\n`P² = (4π² / (G * (M_s + M_p))) * a³`\n\nSince the planets are Earth-like, their mass `M_p` is negligible compared to the stellar mass `M_s` (`M_s + M_p ≈ M_s`). The formula simplifies to:\n`P² ∝ a³ / M_s`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n`a³ ∝ M_s * P²`\n`a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for `a` back into our probability formula:\n`Probability ∝ R_s / (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n`Probability ∝ R_s * M_s^(-1/3) * P^(-2/3)`\n\nLet's find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (`Prob_1`) to that of Planet_2 (`Prob_2`):\n`Ratio = Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (R_s1 * M_s1^(-1/3) * P1^(-2/3)) / (R_s2 * M_s2^(-1/3) * P2^(-2/3))`\n\nWe can group the terms:\n`Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s1 / M_s2)^(-1/3) * (P1 / P2)^(-2/3)`\n\nNow, we plug in the values from the problem description:\n1.  Both host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2` → `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`\n2.  The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of the star hosting Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` → `M_s1 / M_s2 = 2`\n3.  The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P1 = P2 / 3` → `P1 / P2 = 1/3`\n\nSubstituting these into the ratio equation:\n`Ratio = (1) * (2)^(-1/3) * (1/3)^(-2/3)`\n`Ratio = 2^(-1/3) * (3⁻¹)^(-2/3)`\n`Ratio = 2^(-1/3) * 3^(2/3)`\n`Ratio = (3² / 2)^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = 4.5^(1/3)`\n\nThe calculation performed by the code shows that `4.5^(1/3) ≈ 1.65`.\n\nThis means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants me to determine which of two exoplanets has a higher transit probability and by what factor.\n\n**1. Understand Transit Probability**\n\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its star (assuming a random inclination and a circular orbit) is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n\n`Probability (P_transit) ∝ R_s / a`\n\n**2. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities**\n\nWe are not given the semi-major axis (`a`) directly, but we have information about the orbital period (`P`) and the host star's mass (`M_s`). We can connect these using Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion.\n\nThe full form is `P² = (4π² / (G * (M_s + M_p))) * a³`, where `M_p` is the planet's mass and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe problem states the planets are \"Earth-like,\" meaning their mass (`M_p`) is negligible compared to the star's mass (`M_s`). So, we can simplify the relation to:\n\n`P² ∝ a³ / M_s`\n\nWe need to express `a` in terms of `P` and `M_s`:\n\n`a³ ∝ M_s * P²`\n`a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n**3. Combine the Formulas**\n\nNow, substitute the expression for `a` back into the transit probability formula:\n\n`P_transit ∝ R_s / [(M_s * P²)^(1/3)]`\n`P_transit ∝ R_s * M_s^(-1/3) * P^(-2/3)`\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of Probabilities**\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to that of Planet_2 (`P_transit_1 / P_transit_2`).\n\n`Ratio = [R_s1 * M_s1^(-1/3) * P1^(-2/3)] / [R_s2 * M_s2^(-1/3) * P2^(-2/3)]`\n\nLet's group the terms by parameter:\n\n`Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s1 / M_s2)^(-1/3) * (P1 / P2)^(-2/3)`\n\n**5. Plug in the Given Information**\n\nFrom the problem description:\n*   \"both host stars have the same radii\": `R_s1 = R_s2`  => `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`\n*   \"The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2\": `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` => `M_s1 / M_s2 = 2`\n*   \"the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2\": `P1 = P2 / 3` => `P1 / P2 = 1/3`\n\nSubstitute these values into the ratio equation:\n\n`Ratio = (1) * (2)^(-1/3) * (1/3)^(-2/3)`\n\n**6. Simplify the Expression**\n\n`Ratio = 2^(-1/3) * (3⁻¹)^(-2/3)`\n`Ratio = 2^(-1/3) * 3^(2/3)`\n`Ratio = (3²) / (2¹))^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nTo get a numerical answer, we calculate the cube root of 4.5. The Python code executed in the initial step provides this value.\n\n`ratio = (4.5)**(1/3) ≈ 1.65096`\n\n**8. Conclusion**\n\nThe ratio of the probabilities (Planet_1 / Planet_2) is approximately 1.65. This means Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability of transiting than Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
