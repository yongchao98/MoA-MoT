    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM).\n    *   **Condition:** Ultra-high vacuum (< 10⁻⁹ Torr), constant temperature.\n    *   **Particle 1 (for λ1):** Gas molecules.\n    *   **Interaction 1:** Gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n    *   **Result 1:** Mean Free Path (MFP) is λ1.\n    *   **Particle 2 (for λ2):** Electrons from the beam (at 1000 kV).\n    *   **Interaction 2:** Electrons colliding (scattering) with the gas molecules.\n    *   **Result 2:** Mean Free Path (MFP) is λ2.\n    *   **Question:** What is the relationship between λ1 and λ2?\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    *   The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions.\n    *   The general formula for the MFP of a projectile particle moving through a field of target particles is:\n        λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n        *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" of the target that the projectile must hit for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to Both Scenarios:**\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)**\n        *   Projectile: A gas molecule.\n        *   Target: Other gas molecules.\n        *   Number density of targets: `n` (the density of gas molecules).\n        *   Collision cross-section: σ_gg (gas-gas). This is the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the molecules. When considering collisions between identical, moving particles, a correction factor of √2 is introduced to account for their relative motion.\n        *   So, the formula is: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n\n    *   **Scenario 2: Electron-Gas Collisions (λ2)**\n        *   Projectile: An electron.\n        *   Target: Gas molecules.\n        *   Number density of targets: `n` (this is the same as in scenario 1, as the gas conditions haven't changed).\n        *   Collision cross-section: σ_eg (electron-gas). This is the scattering cross-section. Since the electrons are extremely fast (1000 kV is highly relativistic) compared to the thermal motion of the gas molecules, we can consider the gas molecules to be stationary. Thus, the √2 correction factor is not used.\n        *   So, the formula is: **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg:** This is determined by the physical size of the gas molecules. Think of it as the area presented by one molecule to another during a collision. For a molecule with diameter `d`, σ_gg is approximately πd².\n    *   **σ_eg:** This is determined by the interaction between a high-energy electron and a gas molecule. An electron is a point-like particle, vastly smaller than a gas molecule (like N₂ or O₂). A high-energy electron can pass straight through the electron cloud of a gas molecule with little interaction. A \"collision\" (significant scattering) only occurs if the electron passes very close to the atomic nucleus or an orbital electron.\n    *   **Key Insight:** Because the electron is so small and energetic, its effective target area for scattering (σ_eg) is much, much smaller than the effective target area for two gas molecules colliding with each other (σ_gg).\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude: **σ_eg << σ_gg**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Relationship between λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   We have λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) and λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg).\n    *   The mean free path (λ) is *inversely proportional* to the collision cross-section (σ).\n    *   Since σ_eg is much smaller than σ_gg, the denominator for λ2 (n * σ_eg) will be much smaller than the denominator for λ1 (√2 * n * σ_gg).\n    *   A smaller denominator results in a larger value.\n    *   Therefore, we must have **λ2 >> λ1** (λ2 is much greater than λ1).\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This states that λ2 is larger than λ1. This is consistent with our conclusion (λ2 >> λ1).\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: This is the opposite of our conclusion and is incorrect.\n    *   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This states that λ2 is larger than λ1, but only slightly. Our analysis showed that λ2 should be *much* larger, so this option is incorrect. The ratio λ2/λ1 is approximately (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg. Since σ_gg/σ_eg is a large number (e.g., 100 or more), the ratio λ2/λ1 will be much larger than 1.22.\n    *   D) λ2 = λ1: This would imply a specific, incorrect relationship between the cross-sections and is physically wrong.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The only option that correctly reflects the physical reality that the mean free path for a high-energy electron in a gas is much longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves is A. The electron \"sees\" the gas as being much more empty than the gas molecules see each other.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP)\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula for the mean free path of a projectile particle moving through a field of target particles is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that a target particle presents to the projectile for a collision to occur.\n\nIn the given scenario, the number density `n` of the residual gas molecules is constant because the pressure, temperature, and volume of the sample compartment do not change. Therefore, the difference between λ1 and λ2 must arise from the difference in their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Mean Free Path for Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)\n\n*   **Projectile:** A gas molecule.\n*   **Target:** Other gas molecules.\n*   **Interaction:** This is a kinetic collision, where one molecule physically collides with another. The collision cross-section, let's call it σ_gg (gas-gas), is determined by the physical size of the molecules. For a spherical molecule of diameter `d`, σ_gg ≈ πd².\n*   **Correction for Motion:** Since both the projectile and target molecules are in random thermal motion, we must account for their relative velocities. This introduces a correction factor of √2 into the standard formula.\n*   **Formula for λ1:**\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Mean Free Path for Electron-Gas Collisions (λ2)\n\n*   **Projectile:** A high-energy electron (from the 1000 kV beam).\n*   **Target:** A gas molecule.\n*   **Interaction:** This is an electromagnetic interaction (scattering). A \"collision\" occurs when the electron is significantly deflected by the electric field of the gas molecule's nucleus or its orbital electrons.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section:** Let's call this σ_eg (electron-gas). An electron is a point-like particle, and a gas molecule is mostly empty space. The electron is moving at relativistic speeds (very close to the speed of light at 1000 kV), while the gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds. We can consider the gas molecules to be stationary targets, so the √2 correction factor is not used.\n*   **Formula for λ2:**\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)\n\nThis is the crucial step. We need to compare the effective \"size\" of a gas molecule as seen by another gas molecule (σ_gg) versus its effective size as seen by a high-energy electron (σ_eg).\n\n*   **σ_gg:** This is the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical dimensions of the molecule's electron cloud. It's relatively large.\n*   **σ_eg:** This is the scattering cross-section. The high-energy electron can pass through the diffuse electron cloud of the gas molecule with very little interaction. Significant scattering only happens if the electron passes very close to the tiny, dense nucleus or has a direct interaction with one of the orbital electrons. This effective target area is much, much smaller than the overall physical size of the molecule.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the electron-gas scattering cross-section is significantly smaller than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section:\n\n**σ_eg << σ_gg**\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Relationship between λ1 and λ2\n\nSince the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ), and we know that σ_eg is much smaller than σ_gg, it follows that λ2 must be much larger than λ1.\n\n*   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n*   λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\nBecause σ_eg << σ_gg, the denominator for λ2 is much smaller than the denominator for λ1. A smaller denominator results in a larger value.\n\nTherefore, **λ2 >> λ1**.\n\n### Step 6: Evaluate the Given Options\n\n*   **A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1:** This states that λ2 is larger than λ1. Our analysis shows that λ2 is *much* larger than λ1, so this inequality is correct.\n*   **B) λ2 < λ1:** This is incorrect. It would imply electrons collide more frequently than gas molecules, which contradicts the physics of scattering.\n*   **C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1:** This suggests λ2 is only slightly larger than λ1. This is incorrect; the difference is expected to be substantial, likely by one or more orders of magnitude.\n*   **D) λ2 = λ1:** This is incorrect as the collision mechanisms and cross-sections are fundamentally different.\n\nThe only option that correctly describes the physical situation is A. The high-energy electrons perceive the vacuum as being much \"emptier\" than the gas molecules perceive it, leading to a much longer mean free path for the electrons.\n\n<<<A>>>",
