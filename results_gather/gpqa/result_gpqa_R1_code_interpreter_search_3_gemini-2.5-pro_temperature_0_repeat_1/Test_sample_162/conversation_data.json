    "This problem requires us to determine the minimum amount of a strong acid needed to dissolve a specific mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, and the pH of the resulting solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Reaction Stoichiometry:**\n    Iron(III) hydroxide is a sparingly soluble base. It reacts with a strong acid (represented by H+) in a neutralization reaction. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n    Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    This equation shows that for every one mole of Fe(OH)3 that dissolves, three moles of H+ are consumed.\n\n2.  **Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)3:**\n    First, we need to find the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 we want to dissolve.\n    *   Mass of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g\n    *   Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 = (atomic mass of Fe) + 3 * (atomic mass of O + atomic mass of H)\n        *   Molar mass ≈ 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)3 = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n3.  **Dissolution Equilibrium:**\n    The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is also an equilibrium process, described by the solubility product constant, Ksp:\n    Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n    For the solid to be completely dissolved, the ion product quotient (Qsp) must be, at a minimum, equal to Ksp. The value of Ksp for Fe(OH)3 at 25°C is approximately 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹.\n\n4.  **Calculate Final Concentrations:**\n    *   The total volume of the solution is given as 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    *   When all 9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ moles of Fe(OH)3 are dissolved in 0.1 L, the concentration of Fe³⁺ ions will be:\n        [Fe³⁺] = (9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 9.3575 x 10⁻³ M.\n\n5.  **Determine Required Hydroxide and Hydronium Concentrations:**\n    *   Using the Ksp expression, we can find the maximum allowable [OH⁻] in the final solution for all the Fe(OH)3 to be dissolved:\n        Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n        2.79 x 10⁻³⁹ = (9.3575 x 10⁻³ M) * [OH⁻]³\n        [OH⁻]³ = (2.79 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.3575 x 10⁻³) ≈ 2.9818 x 10⁻³⁷\n        [OH⁻] = (2.9818 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 6.680 x 10⁻¹³ M.\n    *   The concentration of H+ in the final solution is related to [OH⁻] by the ion product of water, Kw (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C):\n        [H⁺] = Kw / [OH⁻] = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (6.680 x 10⁻¹³ M) ≈ 0.01497 M.\n\n6.  **Calculate Final pH:**\n    *   The pH of the resulting solution is the negative logarithm of the final H+ concentration:\n        pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]) = -log₁₀(0.01497) ≈ 2.82.\n\n7.  **Calculate Total Moles of Acid Needed:**\n    The total amount of H+ added from the strong acid must account for two parts:\n    *   **H+ reacted:** The amount of H+ that reacted with Fe(OH)3.\n        Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 * (9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.8073 x 10⁻³ mol.\n    *   **H+ remaining:** The amount of H+ that remains in the 0.1 L solution to maintain the final pH.\n        Moles H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺]final * Volume = 0.01497 M * 0.1 L = 1.497 x 10⁻³ mol.\n    *   **Total H+ added:**\n        Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n        Total Moles H⁺ = (2.8073 x 10⁻³) + (1.497 x 10⁻³) = 4.3043 x 10⁻³ mol.\n\n8.  **Calculate Volume of Acid:**\n    *   The acid is a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. We can find the volume needed using the formula Molarity = Moles / Volume.\n        Volume = Total Moles H⁺ / Molarity of acid\n        Volume = (4.3043 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 mol/L = 0.043043 L.\n    *   Converting this volume to cm³ (1 L = 1000 cm³):\n        Volume = 0.043043 L * 1000 cm³/L = 43.04 cm³.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   **pH ≈ 2.82**\n*   **Volume of acid ≈ 43.04 cm³**\n\nLet's compare these results with the given options:\nA) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\nB) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\nC) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\nD) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n\nNone of the options exactly match our calculated values. This discrepancy often arises from using slightly different constants (Ksp, molar masses) in the problem's source material. However, we must choose the closest answer.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options based on our calculated pH of ~2.82.\n*   Option C has a pH of 2.69, which is the closest to our calculated value.\n*   Let's quickly check the calculation if we assume pH = 2.69 (from option C).\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ ≈ 0.00204 M\n    *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = 0.00204 M * 0.1 L = 2.04 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = (2.8073 x 10⁻³) + (2.04 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.0113 x 10⁻³ mol\n    *   Volume of acid = (3.0113 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 M = 0.030113 L = 30.11 cm³\n    This calculation yields a volume of 30.11 cm³, which is extremely close to the 30.09 cm³ given in option C. This confirms that option C is internally consistent and the intended answer, likely based on slightly different initial constants.\n\nThe following Python code performs the calculations described above to find the most consistent option.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants and Initial Values ---\nmass_FeOH3 = 0.1  # g\ntotal_volume_L = 0.1  # 100 cm3 = 0.1 L\nacid_molarity = 0.1  # M\nKw = 1.0e-14  # Ion product of water at 25 C\n\n# Molar masses (g/mol)\nFe = 55.845\nO = 15.999\nH = 1.008\nmolar_mass_FeOH3 = Fe + 3 * (O + H)\n\n# Ksp for Fe(OH)3 at 25 C\nKsp_FeOH3 = 2.79e-39\n\n# --- Step-by-step Calculation ---\n\n# 1.

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The problem asks for two things:\n    a.  The minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid needed to completely dissolve 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n    b.  The pH of the resulting solution.\n    The total final volume of the solution is 100 cm³.\n\n2.  **Identify the Chemical Reactions:**\n    *   **Dissolution/Neutralization:** Iron(III) hydroxide is a base that reacts with an acid (H⁺). The balanced equation is:\n        Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n        This tells us that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ to react completely.\n    *   **Solubility Equilibrium:** The dissolution is also an equilibrium process governed by the solubility product constant, Ksp.\n        Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n        Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n        For the Fe(OH)₃ to be \"just dissolved,\" the ion product of the species in solution must be equal to the Ksp. The value of Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹.\n    *   **Water Autoionization:** The relationship between H⁺ and OH⁻ in the final solution is governed by the ion product of water, Kw.\n        Kw = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ (at 25°C)\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 3.1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃.**\n        -   First, find the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n            -   Molar Mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol\n            -   Molar Mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n            -   Molar Mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n            -   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n        -   Now, calculate the moles from the given mass.\n            -   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n    *   **Step 3.2: Calculate the final concentration of Fe³⁺.**\n        -   When all the Fe(OH)₃ dissolves in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) final volume, the concentration of Fe³⁺ will be:\n            -   [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume = (9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 9.3575 x 10⁻³ M.\n\n    *   **Step 3.3: Calculate the required final pH.**\n        -   Use the Ksp expression to find the maximum [OH⁻] that can exist in the solution for all the Fe³⁺ to remain dissolved.\n            -   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n            -   2.79 x 10⁻³⁹ = (9.3575 x 10⁻³ M) * [OH⁻]³\n            -   [OH⁻]³ = (2.79 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.3575 x 10⁻³) ≈ 2.982 x 10⁻³⁷\n            -   [OH⁻] = (2.982 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 6.68 x 10⁻¹³ M.\n        -   Now, use Kw to find the corresponding [H⁺].\n            -   [H⁺] = Kw / [OH⁻] = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (6.68 x 10⁻¹³ M) ≈ 0.01497 M.\n        -   Calculate the pH.\n            -   pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]) = -log₁₀(0.01497) ≈ 2.82.\n\n    *   **Step 3.4: Calculate the total moles of acid needed.**\n        -   The total H⁺ added from the acid is used for two things:\n            1.  **H⁺ to react:** Moles of H⁺ needed to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃.\n                -   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * (9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.8073 x 10⁻³ mol.\n            2.  **H⁺ remaining:** Moles of H⁺ needed to maintain the final pH of 2.82 in the 0.1 L solution.\n                -   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺]final * Volume = 0.01497 M * 0.1 L = 1.497 x 10⁻³ mol.\n        -   **Total Moles of H⁺** = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n            -   Total Moles H⁺ = (2.8073 x 10⁻³) + (1.497 x 10⁻³) = 4.304 x 10⁻³ mol.\n\n    *   **Step 3.5: Calculate the volume of the 0.1 M acid.**\n        -   Volume = Moles / Molarity\n        -   Volume = (4.304 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 mol/L = 0.04304 L.\n        -   Convert to cm³: 0.04304 L * 1000 cm³/L = 43.04 cm³.\n\n4.  **Compare with Options and Verify:**\n    -   Our calculated result is: **pH ≈ 2.82** and **Volume ≈ 43.04 cm³**.\n    -   This result does not exactly match any of the options, which is common in such problems due to different constants (Ksp, molar masses) being used.\n    -   Let's check which option is the most internally consistent. Option C has a pH of 2.69, which is the closest to our calculated pH. Let's test the values from Option C.\n    -   **Test Option C:** pH = 2.69; Volume = 30.09 cm³\n        -   If pH = 2.69, then the final [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ ≈ 0.002042 M.\n        -   Moles of H⁺ remaining in 0.1 L = 0.002042 M * 0.1 L = 2.042 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n        -   Moles of H⁺ reacted is the same as before: 2.8073 x 10⁻³ mol.\n        -   Total moles of H⁺ needed = (2.8073 x 10⁻³) + (2.042 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.0115 x 10⁻³ mol.\n        -   Volume of 0.1 M acid needed = (3.0115 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 M = 0.030115 L = 30.115 cm³.\n    -   This calculated volume (30.115 cm³) is extremely close to the volume given in Option C (30.09 cm³). This strong internal consistency indicates that Option C is the intended correct answer. The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding in the problem's source values.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants and Initial Values ---\nmass_FeOH3 = 0.1  # g\ntotal_volume_L = 0.1  # 100 cm3 = 0.1 L\nacid_molarity = 0.1  # M\nKw = 1.0e-14  # Ion product of water at 25 C\n\n# Molar masses (g/mol)\nFe = 55.845\nO = 15.999\nH = 1.008\nmolar_mass_FeOH3 = Fe + 3 * (O + H)\n\n# --- Verification of Option C ---\n# We will check if the values in Option C are consistent with the problem statement.\n# Option C: pH = 2.69, Volume = 30.09 cm3\n\n# 1.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Chemistry\nTo dissolve iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, which is a sparingly soluble base, we must add a strong acid. The acid does two things:\n*   It reacts with the Fe(OH)₃ in a neutralization reaction.\n*   It lowers the pH of the solution, which reduces the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) and allows more Fe³⁺ to stay in the solution without precipitating, according to the solubility product principle (Ksp).\n\nThe key chemical equations are:\n*   **Neutralization:** Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   **Solubility Equilibrium:** Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n*   **Water Autoionization:** [H⁺][OH⁻] = K_w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C\n\n### 2. Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃\nFirst, we determine the number of moles of Fe(OH)₃ we need to dissolve.\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 * (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n### 3. Determine the Total Acid Required\nThe total amount of H⁺ ions added from the strong acid is the sum of two parts:\n*   **Part A: H⁺ for Reaction:** The amount of H⁺ that reacts with Fe(OH)₃. From the stoichiometry (1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺):\n    Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * (9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.8073 x 10⁻³ mol.\n*   **Part B: H⁺ Remaining in Solution:** The amount of H⁺ that must remain in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution to keep the Fe(OH)₃ dissolved. This amount determines the final pH.\n\n### 4. Verify the Options\nA direct calculation of the final pH and required volume can be complex and sensitive to the exact Ksp value used. A more robust method for multiple-choice questions is to check the internal consistency of the given options.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Chemistry\nTo dissolve iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, which is a sparingly soluble base, we must add a strong acid. The acid does two things:\n*   It reacts with the Fe(OH)₃ in a neutralization reaction.\n*   It lowers the pH of the solution, which reduces the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) and allows more Fe³⁺ to stay in the solution without precipitating, according to the solubility product principle (Ksp).\n\nThe key chemical equations are:\n*   **Neutralization:** Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   **Solubility Equilibrium:** Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n*   **Water Autoionization:** [H⁺][OH⁻] = K_w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C\n\n### 2. Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃\nFirst, we determine the number of moles of Fe(OH)₃ we need to dissolve.\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 * (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n### 3. Determine the Total Acid Required\nThe total amount of H⁺ ions added from the strong acid is the sum of two parts:\n*   **Part A: H⁺ for Reaction:** The amount of H⁺ that reacts with Fe(OH)₃. From the stoichiometry (1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺):\n    Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * (9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.8073 x 10⁻³ mol.\n*   **Part B: H⁺ Remaining in Solution:** The amount of H⁺ that must remain in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution to keep the Fe(OH)₃ dissolved. This amount determines the final pH.\n\n### 4. Verify the Options\nA direct calculation of the final pH and required volume can be complex and sensitive to the exact Ksp value used. A more robust method for multiple-choice questions is to check the internal consistency of the given options.
