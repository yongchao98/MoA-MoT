    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture Geometry:**\n    The problem describes an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon. A key piece of information is that N is infinitely large (N → ∞). A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides converges to a circle.\n\n2.  **Determine the Radius of the Circle:**\n    The problem states that all apothems of the polygon have a length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side. For a regular N-sided polygon, the relationship between the apothem 'a' and the circumradius R (the distance from the center to a vertex) is given by `a = R * cos(π/N)`.\n    As N approaches infinity (N → ∞), the angle π/N approaches 0. Since cos(0) = 1, the relationship becomes `a = R * 1`, which means `a = R`.\n    Therefore, the N-sided polygon with apothem 'a' becomes a circular aperture with radius 'a'.\n\n3.  **Identify the Physics Phenomenon:**\n    When monochromatic light passes through an aperture, it undergoes diffraction. Since we are looking at the pattern in the \"far field region,\" this is specifically Fraunhofer diffraction. The diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a central bright disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n4.  **Locate the Intensity Minima:**\n    The dark rings in the Airy pattern correspond to the intensity minima. The angular position (θ) of these minima is determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n    The intensity `I(θ)` for a circular aperture of radius 'a' is given by:\n    `I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k*a*sinθ) / (k*a*sinθ)]²`\n    where `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number.\n\n    The minima occur when the numerator `J₁(k*a*sinθ)` is zero (and the denominator is not). This happens when the argument `k*a*sinθ` is equal to one of the non-zero roots of the J₁(x) function. Let's denote these roots as `j₁‚ₙ` for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n    So, the condition for the nth minimum is:\n    `k * a * sin(θₙ) = j₁‚ₙ`\n    `(2π/λ) * a * sin(θₙ) = j₁‚ₙ`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Angular Position (θₙ):**\n    Rearranging the equation, we get:\n    `sin(θₙ) = (j₁‚ₙ / (2π)) * (λ/a)`\n    The problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation (`tanθ ≈ θ`, which also implies `sinθ ≈ θ` for small angles).\n    `θₙ = (j₁‚ₙ / (2π)) * (λ/a)`\n\n6.  **Find the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima:**\n    The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which corresponds to `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    *   For the first minimum (n=1): `θ₁ = (j₁‚₁ / (2π)) * (λ/a)`\n    *   For the second minimum (n=2): `θ₂ = (j₁‚₂ / (2π)) * (λ/a)`\n\n    The angular distance is:\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(j₁‚₂ - j₁‚₁) / (2π)] * (λ/a)`\n\n7.  **Use the Values of the Bessel Function Zeros:**\n    We need the first two positive zeros of the J₁(x) function. These are well-known mathematical constants:\n    *   `j₁‚₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   `j₁‚₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Substitute these values into the expression for `Δθ`:\n    `Δθ = [(7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π)] * (λ/a)`\n    `Δθ = [3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159...)] * (λ/a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ/a)`\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated value is `0.5067 λ/a`. Let's compare this to the given choices:\n    A) 1.220 λ /a\n    B) 0.506 λ / a\n    C) 0.610 λ / a\n    D) 0.500 λ / a\n\n    The calculated result matches option B almost perfectly. Option C, `0.610 λ/a`, corresponds to the position of the first minimum (`θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 / 2π) * λ/a ≈ 0.610 λ/a`), not the distance between the first two.\n\nTo confirm the calculation with high precision, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# The problem reduces to finding the angular distance between the first two minima\n# of the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n# The angular position of the nth minimum is given by theta_n = (j_1n / (2*pi)) * (lambda/a),\n# where j_1n is the nth positive zero of the Bessel function J1(x).\n\n# We need the angular distance Delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1.\n# Delta_theta = [(j_1,2 - j_1,1) / (2*pi)] * (lambda/a)\n\n# Let's calculate the coefficient C = (j_1,2 - j_1,1) / (2*pi).\n# We use scipy's jn_zeros function to find the zeros of J1(x).\n# jn_zeros(1, 2) returns the first two positive zeros of J1(x).\nzeros = jn_zeros(1, 2)\nj1_1 = zeros[0]\nj1_2 = zeros[1]\n\n# Calculate the coefficient C\nC = (j1_2 - j1_1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(f\"{C:.3f}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.507\n</execute_result>\nThe code confirms that the coefficient, rounded to three decimal places, is 0.507, which is closest to 0.506 among the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An N-sided regular polygon with an infinitely large number of sides (N → ∞) converges to a circle. The problem states that the apothem of this polygon is 'a'.
