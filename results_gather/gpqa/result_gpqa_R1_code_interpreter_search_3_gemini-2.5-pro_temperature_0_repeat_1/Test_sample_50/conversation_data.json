    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\nWe have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is held constant at zero (`V_sphere = 0`).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` induces a redistribution of charges on the surface of the conducting sphere. The net effect is an attractive force between the charge `q` and the sphere. The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to the distance `d` from the sphere's center.\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\nThis problem is elegantly solved using the \"method of images.\" The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere can be modeled by removing the sphere and placing an \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location *inside* where the sphere was. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\nFor a grounded sphere, the equivalent system consists of:\n1.  The original charge `q` at distance `d` from the center.\n2.  An image charge `q'` located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`.\n\nThe values for `q'` and `b` that satisfy `V=0` at `r=R` are:\n*   Position of image charge: `b = R^2 / d`\n*   Magnitude of image charge: `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThe potential energy of the system is equal to the work done by an external force to assemble the system. Since the grounded sphere is already in place, we only need to calculate the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`.\n\n`U = W = ∫(from ∞ to d) F_ext ⋅ dr`\n\nThe external force `F_ext` required to move the charge is equal and opposite to the electrostatic force `F_elec` exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n`F_ext = -F_elec`\n\nUsing the method of images, the force on charge `q` at a variable distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `b(x)`.\n\nAt a distance `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` at position `b(x) = R^2/x`.\nThe distance between `q` (at `x`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n\nThe electrostatic force on `q` is:\n`F_elec(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`\n`F_elec(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F_elec(x) = -k * q^2 * R / x * 1 / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n`F_elec(x) = -k * q^2 * R / x * x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n`F_elec(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nThis is an attractive force (negative sign). The external force must be in the opposite direction:\n`F_ext(x) = -F_elec(x) = +k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we integrate this force from `x = ∞` to `x = d` to find the work done, which is the potential energy `U`.\n`U = ∫(from ∞ to d) [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use a substitution:\nLet `u = x^2 - R^2`. Then `du = 2x dx`, which means `x dx = du / 2`.\nThe limits of integration change as well:\n*   When `x → ∞`, `u → ∞`.\n*   When `x = d`, `u = d^2 - R^2`.\n\nSubstituting into the integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * ∫(from ∞ to d^2-R^2) (1/u^2) * (du/2)`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * ∫(from ∞ to d^2-R^2) u^(-2) du`\n\nThe integral of `u^(-2)` is `-u^(-1)` or `-1/u`.\n`U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/u] (from ∞ to d^2-R^2)`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (d^2 - R^2)) - (-1 / ∞)]`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Alternative Method (Energy Formula)\nThe potential energy of a system of charges and conductors is given by `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges.\nFor our system, this becomes:\n`U = (1/2) * (q * V_induced + Q_sphere * V_sphere)`\nSince the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_sphere = 0`.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\nHere, `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere. Using the method of images, this is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n`V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nSubstituting this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere. This is a classic electrostatics problem that can be solved using the method of images.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is fixed at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). The charge `q` will induce a distribution of charges on the surface of the sphere. The net potential energy is the work done to assemble this configuration.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere can be accurately described by a simpler, equivalent system. We remove the sphere and place an \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the original sphere's volume. The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the spherical surface of radius `R` is zero.\n\n    For a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (measured from the center) are given by:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n    The image charge is located on the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n\n    There are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n    **Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n    The work done is `U = W = ∫ F_ext ⋅ dr` from infinity to `d`. The external force `F_ext` is the negative of the electrostatic force `F_elec` on the charge `q`. The electrostatic force on `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which in our model is simply the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    Let the charge `q` be at a variable distance `x` from the center. The force on it is:\n    `F_elec(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between q and q')^2`\n    *   Position of `q`: `x`\n    *   Position of `q'`: `b = R^2 / x`\n    *   Magnitude of `q'`: `-q * (R / x)`\n    *   Distance between them: `x - b = x - R^2/x`\n\n    `F_elec(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\n    The work done to bring the charge from `∞` to `d` is the integral of the external force (`-F_elec`):\n    `U = ∫(from ∞ to d) [-F_elec(x)] dx = ∫(from ∞ to d) [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n    Using the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, `du = 2x dx`:\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * ∫(from ∞ to d^2-R^2) u^(-2) du`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/u] (from ∞ to d^2-R^2)`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/(d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    **Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula**\n    A more direct method uses the formula for the interaction energy of a charge with a conductor. The potential energy `U` is half the product of the charge and the potential at its location due to all other charges (the induced charges).\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n    Here, `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` (distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere. In our image model, this is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    *   `q' = -qR/d`\n    *   Distance = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Now, substitute this into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Both methods yield the same result. The net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. The negative sign indicates that the force is attractive, and the system has lower energy than when the charge is at infinity.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   B) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n    *   C) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   D) `U = - k * q^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Our derived result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem is a classic application of the \"method of images\" in electrostatics. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution.\n\n### 1. The Method of Images\n\nThe electric field and potential in the region outside the grounded conducting sphere can be modeled by an equivalent, simpler system. We replace the sphere with a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" inside the volume that the sphere occupied. This setup must reproduce the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero (`V=0` at radius `r=R`).\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent system consists of:\n*   The original charge `q` at distance `d` from the center.\n*   An image charge `q'` placed at a distance `b` from the center, on the line connecting the center and `q`.\n\nThe values for the image charge and its position that satisfy the `V=0` boundary condition are:\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\n### 2.

In this case, \"all other charges\" refers to the induced charge distribution on the surface of the sphere.\n\nIn our image charge model, the potential created by the induced surface charge is exactly the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nSo, we need to calculate the potential produced by `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n*   The location of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n*   The location of `q'` is at distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n*   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n`distance = d - b = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nNow, we can find `V_induced`, which is the potential from `q'` at the location of `q`:\n\n`V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n`V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n\nThe `d` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator cancels out:\n\n`V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nFinally, we substitute this back into the potential energy formula:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. The negative sign correctly indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, meaning the system has lower energy than when the charge is infinitely far away.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nB) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\nC) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\nD) `U = - k * q^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
