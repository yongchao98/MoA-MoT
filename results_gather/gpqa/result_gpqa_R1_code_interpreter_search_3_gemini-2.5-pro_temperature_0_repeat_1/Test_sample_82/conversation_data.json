    "This problem involves a weak acid-strong base titration. We need to calculate the pH at two specific points: at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n**Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³ = 20.00 mL\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Final volume after adding water (V2) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 mL\n*   Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2:\n    (0.05 M) * (20.00 mL) = M2 * (40.00 mL)\n    M2 = (0.05 * 20.00) / 40.00 = 0.025 M\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 mL of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Titration Reaction and Equivalence Point**\n\nThe reaction between acetic acid (CH₃COOH) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is:\nCH₃COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) → CH₃COONa(aq) + H₂O(l)\n\nTo find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point (V_eq), we equate the moles of acid and base.\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH = M_acid * V_acid = 0.025 mol/L * 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n*   At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n*   Volume of NaOH (V_eq) = Moles_NaOH / M_NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 mL.\n\n**Step 3: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, we have added 25% of the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.\n*   Volume of NaOH added = 0.25 * V_eq = 0.25 * 10.00 mL = 2.50 mL.\n*   Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M * 0.00250 L = 0.00025 mol.\n\nThis amount of NaOH reacts with the acetic acid to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = Initial moles - Moles reacted = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n*   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed = 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe solution now contains a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), forming a buffer. We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\nwhere [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the acid.\n\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   The ratio of concentrations is equal to the ratio of moles.\n*   pH = 4.733 + log(0.00025 / 0.00075) = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n*   So, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**Step 4: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed = 0.001 mol.\n*   Total volume of the solution = Initial acid volume + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.0500 L.\n*   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, acting as a weak base:\nCH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\nWe need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n*   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n\nWe set up an ICE table to find the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻].\n*   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n*   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, we get: x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n*   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n\nNow, we calculate pOH and then pH.\n*   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n*   So, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   The initial volume of acetic acid (V₁) is 20.00 cm³ (or 20.00 mL).\n*   The initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁) is 0.05 M.\n*   Water is added, so the final volume (V₂) is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³.\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration (M₂).\n    M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n*   So, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Determine the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\n*   First, calculate the initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    Moles of acid = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.00100 mol.\n*   The titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O. The stoichiometry is 1:1.\n*   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equals the initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n    Moles of NaOH = 0.00100 mol.\n*   The concentration of the NaOH solution is 0.1 M.\n*   Volume of NaOH (V_eq) = Moles / Concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been neutralized by the base. This means we have added 25% of the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence.\n    Volume of NaOH added = 0.25 × 10.00 cm³ = 2.50 cm³.\n*   At this point, the solution contains both unreacted acetic acid (a weak acid) and its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), forming a buffer solution.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the acid.\n*   At 25% neutralization, 25% of the acid has become conjugate base, and 75% remains as acid. The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is therefore 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   First, calculate pKa from Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n*   The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**4. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.00100 mol) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the acid plus the volume of NaOH added:\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻] is:\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M.\n*   Acetate is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n    CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate. We can find it using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C) and the Ka of acetic acid.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   We set up an equilibrium expression to find the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻]:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n    5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.020 M.\n    x² ≈ (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.020 = 1.082 × 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Now, calculate pOH and then pH:\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.

The searched results will be returned between <information> and </information>.\nOnce the search query is complete, stop the generation. Then, the search platform will return the searched results.\n\nIf you need to search the web, do not generate code in the same response. Vice versa. You can also solve the question without code and searching, just by your textual reasoning.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code or search queries to solve the problem.\n\n    question: We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 °C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.\n\nA) 4.73; 7.00\nB) 4.26; 8.52\nC) 4.57; 6.92\nD) 3.17; 6.73\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
