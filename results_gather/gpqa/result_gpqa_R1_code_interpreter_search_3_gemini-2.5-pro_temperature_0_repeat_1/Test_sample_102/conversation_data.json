    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent molecule is benzene.\n*   It has three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming groups to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho-, para*-director.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern suggests that the synthesis should prioritize reactions that are directed by *meta*-directing groups.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**Sequence A:**\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction attaches an acetyl group to the benzene ring, forming acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is a good start for achieving a 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   Product: Acetophenone.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** The acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine atom to the *meta* position.\n    *   Product: 3-Bromoacetophenone. This correctly establishes the 1,3-relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** Now the ring has two substituents: an acetyl group at C1 (*meta*-director) and a bromo group at C3 (*ortho-, para*-director).\n    *   The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5.\n    *   The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   In cases like this, where directing groups are in conflict, we must consider their relative strengths. The acetyl group is a strong deactivator, particularly at its ortho and para positions (C2, C4, C6). The bromo group is also deactivating but directs to its ortho/para positions (C2, C4, C6). The position C5 is meta to both the strongly deactivating acetyl group and the bromo group. It turns out that C5 is the least deactivated position overall, making it the primary site for nitration.\n    *   Product: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This is the desired target molecule.\n*   The first three steps of this sequence provide a high-yield route to the target compound. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) describe the reduction of the nitro group and removal of the resulting amine, which is irrelevant as the target molecule has already been synthesized. The question asks for a sequence that *leads to* the synthesis, and this path does.\n\n**Sequence B:**\n*   **i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4:** Forms nitrobenzene (-NO2 is a *meta*-director).\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl:** Reduces the nitro group to an amino group, forming aniline (-NH2 is a strong *ortho-, para*-director).\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on aniline because the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, creating a strongly deactivated ring. This step is not feasible as written. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Sequence C:**\n*   **i) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3:** Forms bromobenzene (-Br is an *ortho-, para*-director).\n*   **ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4:** This nitration will produce a mixture of 2-bromonitrobenzene and 4-bromonitrobenzene. It is impossible to get a pure 1,3,5-substituted product from this mixture in subsequent steps. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Sequence D:**\n*   **i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline**\n*   **iii) Aniline -> Benzenediazonium chloride (via NaNO2/HCl)**\n*   **iv) Benzenediazonium chloride -> Benzene (via H3PO2)**\n*   This sequence of reactions starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It does not produce the target molecule. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly sequence A describes a chemically sound and high-yield pathway to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, specifically within its first three steps. The presence of additional, unnecessary steps in the option does not invalidate the correctness of the initial synthetic route.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires us to determine the correct order of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.

The positions ortho and para to the acetyl group (C2, C4, C6) are strongly deactivated. Therefore, the incoming nitro group will preferentially add to position C5.\n    *   *Product: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one*.

    "This problem requires a careful analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions and the directing effects of various substituents. The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship. This means each group is *meta* to the other two. This pattern is a major clue for planning the synthesis.\n\n### **2. Recall Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, the group already on the ring directs the next incoming group.\n*   **Meta-directors (Deactivating):** -COCH₃ (acetyl), -NO₂ (nitro). These groups withdraw electron density from the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position.\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (Deactivating):** -Br (bromo). Halogens are an exception; they are deactivating but direct to the ortho and para positions.\n\nSince the final product has a 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be controlled by *meta*-directing groups.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step to determine the most logical and effective route.\n\n**A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n\n*   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene reacts with acetyl chloride (CH₃COCl) and AlCl₃ to form **acetophenone**. The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a **meta-director**. This is an excellent first step to establish a meta relationship.\n*   **Step ii: Bromination.** Acetophenone is brominated. The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine atom to the meta position (C3). This forms **3-bromoacetophenone**. The desired 1,3-relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups is now established.\n*   **Step iii: Nitration.** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The ring has two directing groups:\n    *   -COCH₃ at C1 (meta-director, directs to C5).\n    *   -Br at C3 (ortho, para-director, directs to C2, C4, C6).\n    The position C5 is meta to both the strongly deactivating acetyl group and the bromo group. The other positions (C2, C4, C6) are ortho or para to the strongly deactivating acetyl group, making them less reactive. Therefore, the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) is directed to position C5. This reaction yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence successfully produces the target molecule in high yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are irrelevant to the formation of the desired product but the initial pathway is correct.\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n\n*   **Step i:** Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii:** Reduction of nitrobenzene gives aniline (-NH₂).\n*   **Step iii:** Friedel-Crafts acylation **fails** on aniline. The basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a highly deactivated complex that prevents the reaction. This sequence is not viable.\n\n**C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n\n*   **Step i:** Bromination of benzene gives bromobenzene. The bromo group is an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Step ii:** Nitration of bromobenzene would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. It will not produce the 1,3-isomer needed for the final product. This sequence leads to the wrong substitution pattern.\n\n**D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n\n*   **Steps i-iv:** This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) is a known method to remove an amino group, but starting from benzene, it simply converts benzene back into benzene. The sequence is nonsensical as a starting point.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nSequence A is the only one that correctly applies the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution to achieve the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern. It strategically installs a meta-director first, which then controls the position of the subsequent substitutions.\n\n<<<A>>>",
