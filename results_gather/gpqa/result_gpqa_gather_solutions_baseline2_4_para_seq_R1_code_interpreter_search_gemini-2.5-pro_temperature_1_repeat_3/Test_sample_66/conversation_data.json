A step-by-step analysis, which reflects the unanimous reasoning of the candidate answers, leads to a single, unambiguous result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State:**\n    The system is described by the state ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This is the *coupled basis* representation. The most important information for this specific problem are the quantum numbers for the z-component of the angular momentum.\n    *   The total magnetic quantum number for the system is **m = -1**.\n    *   This means the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. A measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum on this state must yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$ with certainty.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the *individual* z-components of angular momentum and obtaining:\n    *   For the first electron ($L_{1z}$), an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   For the second electron ($L_{2z}$), an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This potential final state is described in the *uncoupled basis*.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law:**\n    A core principle of angular momentum addition in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component. This relationship between the operators, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, imposes a strict **selection rule** on their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    \n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n    This rule means that a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be composed of (and therefore can only be measured to be in) uncoupled states for which the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is equal to $m$. Any proposed outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state according to this selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state: The total magnetic quantum number is **m = -1**.\n    *   For the desired final state: The sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n    \n    The selection rule requires that $-1 = -2$. This is false.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability:**\n    Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the desired measurement outcome violates a fundamental conservation law of physics (the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum). An event that is forbidden by a conservation law has a probability of exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Selection Rule as a Shortcut:** This problem appears to be about calculating Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to transform from the coupled basis to the uncoupled basis. However, the first check should always be the selection rules. In this case, the `m = m₁ + m₂` rule provides a definitive answer without any complex calculation.\n*   **Orthogonality:** The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state (with $m_1=-1, m_2=-1$) is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of a system transitioning to a state to which it is orthogonal is zero.\n*   **Consensus in Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers correctly identified and applied the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ and correctly concluded that the probability is 0. The discrepancies in their final lettered answers arise from a failure to correctly map the result \"0\" to the provided options. Based on the correct physical reasoning, the answer must be 0.\n\nLooking at the options provided in the question:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 2/3\nD) 1/2\n\nThe calculated probability is 0, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers and the principles of quantum mechanics, here is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State**: The two-electron system is described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This is the \"coupled basis\" representation. The key information extracted from this is:\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: The orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: The orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   $l = 2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number for the system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum. This is the most crucial value for solving this problem. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator, and a measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum will *always* yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome**: A joint measurement is performed on the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We are asked for the probability of obtaining a specific result:\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding electron 1 in a state with individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding electron 2 in a state with individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state corresponds to the \"uncoupled basis\" state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Governing Conservation Law**: The fundamental principle governing the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of its z-component. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    This rule is absolute. A coupled state with total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be found in a configuration of uncoupled components ($m_1, m_2$) if their sum is exactly equal to $m$. Any outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We now apply this selection rule to the problem:\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is fixed at **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability**: The selection rule requires $m = m_1 + m_2$. We must check if this holds:\n    Is $-1 = -2$? No, the equality is false.\n    Because the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, the event is physically forbidden. The probability of a physically impossible event is exactly zero.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Eigenstate Certainty**: The initial state is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator. This means the value $m_{total} = -1$ is known with 100% certainty before the measurement of the individual components.\n*   **Conservation During Measurement**: The measurement of the individual components does not change the total value of the conserved quantity. If the system starts with a total $L_z$ of $-1\\hbar$, the final state's components must sum to yield a total $L_z$ of $-1\\hbar$.\n*   **Formal Calculation (Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients)**: The probability is formally given by the square of the magnitude of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which connects the coupled and uncoupled bases: $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$. In this case, $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. By definition, Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are zero unless $m=m_1+m_2$. Since this condition is violated, the coefficient is zero, and thus the probability is zero.\n*   **Distinguishing Possible vs. Impossible Outcomes**: For this initial state ($m=-1$), a measurement of ($m_1=0, m_2=-1$) or ($m_1=-1, m_2=0$) would be possible and would have a non-zero probability. The specific outcome requested, ($m_1=-1, m_2=-1$), is impossible.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the joint probability of the specified measurement outcome is exactly 0. All 15 candidate answers arrived at this same numerical conclusion based on this unambiguous physical principle.\n\nThe provided options are A) 0, B) 1/2, C) 2/3, D) 1. The calculated probability of 0 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a problem in quantum mechanics concerning the addition of angular momentum. Below is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State**: The system of two electrons is described by the state vector in the *coupled basis*, given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$: These are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons.\n    *   $l=2$: This is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number for the 2-electron system.\n    *   $m=-1$: This is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum. This is the most important piece of information. It means the system has a definite, well-defined total z-component of angular momentum, and the value of its corresponding quantum number is -1.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Final State (The Measurement Outcome)**: A measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state is described in the *uncoupled basis*.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law**: The core physical principle governing this problem is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum when adding angular momenta. The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship leads to a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    \n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    \n    This rule states that a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be a superposition of uncoupled states where the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is equal to `m`. Any measurement outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We now check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state by applying the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Their sum is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n    *   Comparing the initial requirement with the final outcome: **$-1 \\neq -2$**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability**: The selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated. This means the desired measurement outcome is physically forbidden by the law of conservation of angular momentum. The probability of an event that is physically impossible is **0**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Conservation Laws are Absolute**: In quantum mechanics, a selection rule derived from a fundamental conservation law (like the conservation of angular momentum) is not an approximation. Its violation implies that the probability of the event is exactly zero.\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis**: The initial state is given in the coupled basis $|l, m\\rangle$, which is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum. The measurement projects this state onto the uncoupled basis $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$. The connection between these bases is made via Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which are defined to be zero unless the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied.\n*   **Orthogonality**: A more formal way to see this is to recognize that the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state, characterized by $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, is an eigenstate of the same $L_z$ operator but with eigenvalue $(-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) that correspond to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of a system transitioning to a state orthogonal to itself is zero.\n\nThe analysis robustly and unambiguously shows the probability is 0. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, drawing upon the unanimous reasoning found in the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial Quantum State:**\n    The system of two electrons is described in the coupled basis by the state ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Let's break down this notation:\n    *   $l_1=1, l_2=1$: These are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons. They are in p-orbitals.\n    *   $l=2$: This is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number for the combined two-electron system.\n    *   **$m=-1$**: This is the total magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the system's angular momentum. This is the most important piece of information for this problem. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. A measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum on this state is guaranteed to yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific joint measurement on the individual components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The measurement of $L_{1z}$ yields an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the first electron being found in a state with individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   The measurement of $L_{2z}$ yields an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the second electron being found in a state with individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law:**\n    In quantum mechanics, the addition of angular momentum follows a strict conservation law for the z-component. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship imposes a definitive selection rule on their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    This rule means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be composed of, or measured to be in, uncoupled states where the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) equals $m$. Any outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    We must now check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state based on the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is fixed: **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired final measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is: **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:**\n    We compare the value of $m$ from the initial state with the value of $m_1 + m_2$ from the desired final state.\n    *   The conservation law requires $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   In our case, this becomes the statement: $-1 = -2$.\n    This is false. The desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that is forbidden by a conservation law has a probability of exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Decisive Factor**: The solution hinges entirely on the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum ($m = m_1 + m_2$). The values of the total angular momentum quantum numbers ($l_1, l_2, l$) are not needed for this specific calculation once the initial $m$ is known.\n*   **Orthogonality**: A more formal way to understand this is through the orthogonality of eigenstates. The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state, corresponding to $m_1=-1, m_2=-1$, is part of a subspace that is an eigenstate of the same $L_z$ operator but with a different eigenvalue, $(-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of measuring one state from another is the square of the inner product (the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient in this case), which is zero for orthogonal states.\n*   **Consensus in Reasoning**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identified the reasoning outlined above. The physics is unambiguous, and every agent concluded that the probability must be 0. Discrepancies in the final letter choices (e.g., some choosing A, B, C, or D) are clearly mapping errors where the agent either misread the options or made a mistake in associating their correct numerical answer (0) with the corresponding letter. The core physical analysis is sound across all samples.\n\nBased on the universally agreed-upon physical reasoning, the probability is 0. According to the options provided in the question: A) 0, B) 2/3, C) 1/2, D) 1. The correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial Quantum State\nThe system of two electrons is in the coupled angular momentum state described by the ket:\n$|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$\nThis notation provides the following key information:\n*   $l_1 = 1, l_2 = 1$: The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons.\n*   $l = 2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the combined system.\n*   **$m = -1$**: The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum. This is the most crucial piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. Any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum on this state must, with certainty, yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Desired Measurement Outcome\nThe question asks for the joint probability of a specific measurement on the individual components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n*   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is measured to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the first electron having an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n*   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also measured to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the second electron having an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\nThis desired outcome corresponds to finding the system in a state where the individual quantum numbers are $(-1, -1)$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Law of Conservation\nThe core physical principle governing this problem is the addition of angular momentum in quantum mechanics. Specifically, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the simple sum of the individual z-components. The operator relationship is:\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThis leads to a strict **selection rule** for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n**$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n\nThis rule means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be a superposition of uncoupled states where the sum of the individual quantum numbers `m₁` and `m₂` is equal to `m`. If this rule is not satisfied for a potential outcome, that outcome is physically impossible to measure from the given initial state.\n\n### Step 4: Check for Consistency\nWe must check if the desired measurement outcome is physically possible by applying the selection rule.\n*   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n*   For the desired final measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\nNow, we compare the two values. The selection rule requires $m = m_1 + m_2$. In our case, this would require:\n$-1 = -2$\nThis is a false statement.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Probability\nSince the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically forbidden. Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points and Synthesis of Candidate Answers\n1.  **Unanimous Reasoning**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identified the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum ($m = m_1 + m_2$) as the decisive principle.\n2.  **Correct Calculation**: All candidates correctly calculated that the initial state has $m=-1$ while the desired final state would require a total of $m_1+m_2=-2$.\n3.  **Correct Conclusion**: All candidates correctly concluded that since $-1 \\neq -2$, the event is impossible and its probability is 0.\n4.  **No Complex Calculations Needed**: It is not necessary to calculate any Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The selection rule is sufficient to immediately find the answer. The probability is given by $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$, and this Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero by definition because the selection rule is violated.\n5.  **Mapping to Options**: The only point of failure in some candidate answers was incorrectly mapping the numerical result \"0\" to the given multiple-choice letters. Given the options A) 0, B) 2/3, C) 1, D) 1/2, the probability of 0 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and adding key points for clarity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial Quantum State:**\n    The system is given in the *coupled basis*, represented by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Let's break down this notation:\n    *   $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$: These are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons. An $l=1$ state corresponds to a p-orbital.\n    *   $l=2$: This is the quantum number for the magnitude of the *total* orbital angular momentum of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m=-1$: This is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum. This is the most critical piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of a specific measurement outcome on the *individual* electrons:\n    *   The eigenvalue of the first electron's $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number of $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the second electron's $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number of $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state corresponds to finding the system in a state where the individual z-components are known, which is a state in the *uncoupled basis*.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (Selection Rule):**\n    A core principle of adding angular momenta in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component. The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the direct sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    This relationship imposes a strict selection rule on their corresponding quantum numbers. For a measurement to be possible, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$ and $m_2$) in the final state must equal the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the initial state.\n    **Selection Rule: $m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    If this condition is not met, the transition from the initial state to the final measured state is forbidden.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    We must check if the desired measurement outcome is physically possible by applying the selection rule:\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Their sum is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:**\n    Now we compare the total quantum number required by the initial state with the sum from the desired final state.\n    *   Is $m = m_1 + m_2$?\n    *   Is $-1 = -2$? **No, this is false.**\n\nSince the desired measurement outcome violates the law of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is a physically impossible event. The probability of an impossible event is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Basis States**: The initial state is given in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$), where the total angular momentum is defined. The measurement outcome is described in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$), where the individual components are defined. The connection between these bases is governed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **The Critical Information**: The entire problem is solved by focusing on the magnetic quantum numbers ($m, m_1, m_2$). The total angular momentum quantum numbers ($l, l_1, l_2$) are consistent ($|1-1| \\le 2 \\le 1+1$ is true), but they are not needed to evaluate the probability of this specific outcome.\n*   **Underlying Mathematics**: The probability is formally given by the square of the magnitude of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. These coefficients are zero by definition if the selection rule $m=m_1+m_2$ is not satisfied. Thus, the probability is $0^2=0$.\n*   **Consensus**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identify this reasoning and unanimously conclude that the probability is 0. The discrepancies in their final letter choice are mapping errors; the physics conclusion is sound.\n\nThe calculated probability is 0, which corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State:** The system is described in the *coupled basis* by the state ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1=1, l_2=1$: The two electrons are in p-orbitals.\n    *   $l=2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n    *   $m=-1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the **total** angular momentum. This is the most critical piece of information. It means the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Final State (The Measurement Outcome):** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the *individual* z-components of angular momentum and getting:\n    *   $L_{1z}$ eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   $L_{2z}$ eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state corresponds to the *uncoupled* basis state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle = |-1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law:** A core principle in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum when adding momenta. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $$m = m_1 + m_2$$\n    This rule means that for a system to be in a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number $m$, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$ and $m_2$) of any possible measured state *must* equal $m$.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We apply the selection rule to the problem:\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Their sum is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability:** We compare the required total from the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum from the desired final state ($m_1+m_2=-2$). Since **$-1 \\neq -2$**, the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Such an event is physically impossible. The probability of a physically impossible event is **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Basis States**: It is essential to distinguish between the coupled basis $|l, m\\rangle$ (which describes the system as a whole) and the uncoupled basis $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ (which describes the individual parts). The initial state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operators, while the measurement projects the system onto eigenstates of the individual component operators.\n*   **The Selection Rule is Absolute**: The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not an approximation; it is an exact consequence of the definition of total angular momentum. If the rule is violated, the probability is not just small, it is exactly zero.\n*   **No Need for Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients**: While the formal way to calculate the probability involves a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ($P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$), one does not need to look up the value of this coefficient. By definition, all Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are zero if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met.\n\nThe physical reasoning is unambiguous and unanimously supported by all the candidate answers.

A step-by-step analysis is required to determine the probability of a specific measurement outcome.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State of the System.**\n    The system consists of two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state, described by the ket notation $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$: These are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons. An l-value of 1 corresponds to a p-orbital.\n    *   $l=2$: This is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the combined two-electron system.\n    *   $m=-1$: This is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum. This is the most crucial piece of information for solving the problem. It signifies that the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Desired Measurement Outcome.**\n    A joint measurement is to be performed on the individual z-components of the angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining the following result:\n    *   The measured eigenvalue for the first electron's $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The measured eigenvalue for the second electron's $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (The Selection Rule).**\n    In quantum mechanics, the addition of angular momenta follows a strict conservation law for the z-component. The total z-component operator is the direct sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    This relationship imposes a strict **selection rule** on their corresponding quantum numbers. For any possible measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$ and $m_2$) must equal the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the initial state.\n    **Selection Rule: $m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    A measurement outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check if the Desired Outcome is Physically Possible.**\n    We must apply the selection rule to our specific scenario.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is precisely **m = -1**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n    *   We then check if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied. In this case, we check if $-1 = -2$. This statement is **false**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability.**\n    Since the desired measurement outcome violates the fundamental law of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it represents a physically impossible event. The probability of an impossible event is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Orthogonality**: The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with an eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state, characterized by $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$, is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with an eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) that correspond to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. The probability of transitioning from one state to another upon measurement is the squared magnitude of their inner product, which is zero for orthogonal states.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients**: Formally, the probability is given by the squared magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient connecting the initial and final states: $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are, by definition, zero unless the selection rule $m = m_1+m_2$ is satisfied. Since the rule is violated, the coefficient is zero, and the probability is zero.\n*   **Irrelevance of `l=2`**: While the total angular momentum quantum number `l=2` is given, it is not strictly necessary to solve this particular question, which can be fully resolved using the conservation of the z-component ($m$) alone.\n\nBased on this analysis, the probability is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the key points from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State and Its Properties**: The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the *coupled basis* as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The critical information from this notation is:\n    *   The individual angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\n    *   The total angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number for the **total** z-component of angular momentum is **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, and a measurement of the total z-component will always yield the eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome**: A joint measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining a specific outcome:\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This desired final state corresponds to the *uncoupled basis* state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (Selection Rule)**: The core principle that governs this problem is the addition of angular momentum. The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual components. This relationship between the operators ($L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$) imposes a strict selection rule on their quantum numbers:\n    $$m = m_1 + m_2$$\n    This rule means that a state with a total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be found in a configuration where the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$, $m_2$) sum to $m$. Any outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check if the Desired Outcome is Possible**: We must check if the desired outcome is consistent with the initial state by applying the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability**: We compare the required total from the initial state (`-1`) with the sum from the desired final state (`-2`). Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event forbidden by a conservation law has a probability of exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis**: It is essential to recognize that the problem starts in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and asks about a measurement result in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The connection between these bases is governed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **The `m = m₁ + m₂` Selection Rule**: This is a strict, non-negotiable rule. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is defined to be zero unless this condition is met. The probability is the square of this coefficient, so it is also zero.\n*   **Eigenstates and Conservation**: The initial state is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The final desired state is an eigenstate of the same operator, but with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$. Since these eigenvalues are different, the states are orthogonal, and the probability of transitioning from one to the other is zero. This reflects the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n*   **Ignoring other information**: The values of $l_1$, $l_2$, and $l$ are not needed to solve this specific problem, as the selection rule on the magnetic quantum numbers is sufficient to reach the conclusion.\n\nBased on this unanimous reasoning, the joint probability is 0.

The total magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the system's angular momentum is definitively -1. This means the state is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z$, with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome:** A joint measurement of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. We need to find the probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state corresponds to the system being found in the *uncoupled* state with individual quantum numbers $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law:** In quantum mechanics, when adding angular momenta, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. The operator relationship is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict and powerful selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    This rule is fundamental. It means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be composed of, or measured to be in, uncoupled states where the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is exactly equal to $m$.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state according to this conservation law.\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is fixed: **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual quantum numbers would be: **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:** The selection rule requires $m = m_1 + m_2$. Let's compare the values:\n    *   Required by initial state: $m = -1$\n    *   Result from final state: $m_1+m_2 = -2$\n    Since **$-1 \\neq -2$**, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible. The probability of such an event is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Basis Mismatch:** The problem starts in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and asks about a measurement in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The selection rule $m=m_1+m_2$ is the critical bridge between these two descriptions.\n*   **Eigenstates and Orthogonality:** The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state (with $m_1=-1, m_2=-1$) is an eigenstate of the same $L_z$ operator but with a different eigenvalue, $-2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of transitioning from one state to an orthogonal one is zero.\n*   **No Calculation Needed:** The power of the selection rule is that it acts as a \"veto\". Since the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, we know the probability is zero without needing to compute any Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or perform a full basis expansion. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is by definition zero.\n*   **Consensus Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers correctly identified and applied this conservation law, arriving at the correct numerical result of 0.

The most important piece of information for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome**: The question asks for the probability of a joint measurement on the *individual* components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The desired outcome is:\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law**: The core principle governing the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of its z-component.

The critical information here is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This value is definite for the initial state, meaning the system is an eigenstate of the operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. A measurement of the total $L_z$ would yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$ with certainty.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Desired Measurement Outcome**: The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the *individual* z-components of angular momentum for each electron and getting the eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for both. This corresponds to a final state with the following individual magnetic quantum numbers:\n    *   First electron: $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   Second electron: $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (Selection Rule)**: The core physical principle governing the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. This leads to a strict selection rule that connects the coupled and uncoupled bases: the total magnetic quantum number must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers.\n    **Selection Rule:** $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    A transition from an initial state to a final state is only possible if this rule is satisfied. If the rule is violated, the probability of that outcome is zero.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We must check if the desired outcome is physically consistent with the initial state by applying the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = **-2**$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability**: We compare the required total `m` from the initial state (`-1`) with the sum from the desired final state (`-2`).

It signifies that the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n### Step 2: Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome\nA joint measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of the angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining a specific result for both electrons:\n*   The measurement of $L_{1z}$ yields the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the first electron being in a state with an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n*   The measurement of $L_{2z}$ yields the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the second electron being in a state with an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\nThis desired final state would have a total z-component angular momentum corresponding to the quantum number $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (The Selection Rule)\nThe core physical principle that governs this problem is the addition of angular momenta. A fundamental law of quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the direct sum of the individual z-components.\nOperator relationship: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThis operator relationship imposes a strict and inviolable **selection rule** on their corresponding quantum numbers:\n**$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n\nThis means that a coupled state with a definite total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be composed of uncoupled states for which the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is exactly equal to $m$. Any measurement outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Desired Outcome is Possible\nLet's apply the selection rule to our specific case:\n*   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **$m = -1$**.\n*   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   The sum of these individual quantum numbers for the desired outcome is: **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\nNow, we compare the total quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum required by the final state ($m_1+m_2 = -2$). The selection rule requires $m = m_1 + m_2$. For our problem, this would mean:\n$-1 = -2$\nThis statement is false.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Probability\nSince the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is a **physically impossible** event. The probability of an event that is forbidden by a fundamental conservation law is exactly **0**.\n\nMore formally, the probability of finding the system in the state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$ is the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are, by definition, zero unless $m=m_1+m_2$. Since this rule is violated, the coefficient is zero, and so is the probability.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   The most crucial part of the initial state ket $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$ is the last number, $m=-1$, which represents a definite total value.\n*   The most crucial part of the question is that a measurement on *both* electrons results in an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$, which means the final state must have $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$.\n*   The entire problem is solvable by simply checking the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$. It is unnecessary to calculate the full Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the expansion of the initial state. The violation of this single rule immediately tells you the probability is zero.\n*   It is important to map the calculated numerical answer (0) to the correct letter option provided in the question.\n\nBased on the analysis, the joint probability is 0. The options are A) 2/3, B) 0, C) 1/2, D) 1. The correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State:** The system is in the *coupled angular momentum basis* state, represented by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Let's break down the quantum numbers:\n    *   $l_1 = 1, l_2 = 1$: The two electrons each have an orbital angular momentum quantum number of 1 (they are in p-orbitals).\n    *   $l = 2$: This is the quantum number for the magnitude of the *total* orbital angular momentum of the system.\n    *   $m = -1$: This is the quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum. This is the most crucial piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the probability of a specific joint measurement outcome on the *individual* electrons:\n    *   The measurement of $L_{1z}$ (for electron 1) yields an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The measurement of $L_{2z}$ (for electron 2) also yields an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state belongs to the *uncoupled basis*.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law:** A core principle of quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum during the addition process. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This physical law imposes a strict **selection rule** on the corresponding quantum numbers: for a state to be possible, the total magnetic quantum number must equal the sum of the individual ones.\n    $$m = m_1 + m_2$$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is physically possible given the initial state and the conservation law.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = \\mathbf{-2}$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability:** Let's apply the selection rule: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    Is $-1 = -2$? **No.**\n    The desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. A system that is known to have a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$ cannot be measured and found in a final configuration that has a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$. Such an event is physically impossible. The probability of a physically impossible event is **0**.\n\n### Careful Points and Analysis of Candidate Answers\n*   **Unanimous Reasoning:** All the provided candidate answers correctly identify the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ as the key to solving the problem. They all correctly apply it and conclude that since $-1 \\neq (-1) + (-1)$, the probability must be 0.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** The probability is formally calculated as the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient connecting the initial and final states: $P = |\\langle l_1,m_1; l_2,m_2 | l,m \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1,-1; 1,-1 | 2,-1 \\rangle|^2$. These coefficients are defined to be zero unless $m=m_1+m_2$, confirming the probability is exactly 0.\n*   **Inconsistent Final Letter Choice:** The candidate answers disagree on the final letter (A, B, C, or D).

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus reasoning from the candidate answers and adding key points for clarity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State:** The system of two electrons is described in the coupled basis by the state ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Let's break down this notation:\n    *   $l_1=1, l_2=1$: Each electron has an individual orbital angular momentum quantum number of 1.\n    *   $l=2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number for the combined two-electron system.\n    *   $m=-1$: This is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum. This is the most crucial piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of a specific measurement outcome on the individual electrons' angular momenta. This is described in the uncoupled basis.\n    *   The measured eigenvalue for the first electron's $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The measured eigenvalue for the second electron's $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (The Selection Rule):** A core principle of adding angular momenta in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component. The total z-component operator is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship imposes a strict selection rule on their corresponding quantum numbers. For a measurement to be possible, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers in the final state must equal the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state.\n    **Selection Rule:** `m = m₁ + m₂`\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is physically possible by applying this rule.\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **m = -1**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be **m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:** We compare the total quantum number required by the initial state (`-1`) with the sum from the desired final state (`-2`). Since **-1 ≠ -2**, the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible. Therefore, the probability of this measurement occurring is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **The Power of the Selection Rule:** The entire problem is solvable by simply checking the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$. The other quantum numbers ($l_1, l_2, l$) are not needed for this specific question. Any outcome violating this rule has zero probability.\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem highlights the difference between the coupled basis $|l, m\\rangle$, where the system's total angular momentum is defined, and the uncoupled basis $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$, where the individual components are defined. The probability of transitioning from the former to the latter is what's being calculated.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** A more formal way to state the same principle is that the initial state is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state (with $m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1$) is an eigenstate of the same operator but with a different eigenvalue, $-2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of one state being measured in a state orthogonal to it is zero.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** The probability is formally given by the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. These coefficients are zero by definition if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met, confirming that the probability is zero without any need for calculation.\n\nGiven the unambiguous result that the probability is 0, we select the corresponding option.\n\n<<<A>>>"

This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This potential final state is described in the *uncoupled basis*.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law:**\n    A core principle of angular momentum addition in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component. This relationship between the operators, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, imposes a strict **selection rule** on their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    \n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n    This rule means that a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be composed of (and therefore can only be measured to be in) uncoupled states for which the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is equal to $m$. Any proposed outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state according to this selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state: The total magnetic quantum number is **m = -1**.\n    *   For the desired final state: The sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n    \n    The selection rule requires that $-1 = -2$. This is false.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability:**\n    Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the desired measurement outcome violates a fundamental conservation law of physics (the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum). An event that is forbidden by a conservation law has a probability of exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Selection Rule as a Shortcut:** This problem appears to be about calculating Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to transform from the coupled basis to the uncoupled basis. However, the first check should always be the selection rules. In this case, the `m = m₁ + m₂` rule provides a definitive answer without any complex calculation.\n*   **Orthogonality:** The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state (with $m_1=-1, m_2=-1$) is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of a system transitioning to a state to which it is orthogonal is zero.\n*   **Consensus in Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers correctly identified and applied the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ and correctly concluded that the probability is 0. The discrepancies in their final lettered answers arise from a failure to correctly map the result \"0\" to the provided options. Based on the correct physical reasoning, the answer must be 0.\n\nLooking at the options provided in the question:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 2/3\nD) 1/2\n\nThe calculated probability is 0, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers and the principles of quantum mechanics, here is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State**: The two-electron system is described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This is the \"coupled basis\" representation. The key information extracted from this is:\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: The orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: The orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   $l = 2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number for the system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum. This is the most crucial value for solving this problem. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator, and a measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum will *always* yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome**: A joint measurement is performed on the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We are asked for the probability of obtaining a specific result:\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding electron 1 in a state with individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding electron 2 in a state with individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state corresponds to the \"uncoupled basis\" state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Governing Conservation Law**: The fundamental principle governing the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of its z-component. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    This rule is absolute. A coupled state with total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be found in a configuration of uncoupled components ($m_1, m_2$) if their sum is exactly equal to $m$. Any outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We now apply this selection rule to the problem:\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is fixed at **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability**: The selection rule requires $m = m_1 + m_2$. We must check if this holds:\n    Is $-1 = -2$? No, the equality is false.\n    Because the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, the event is physically forbidden. The probability of a physically impossible event is exactly zero.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Eigenstate Certainty**: The initial state is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator. This means the value $m_{total} = -1$ is known with 100% certainty before the measurement of the individual components.\n*   **Conservation During Measurement**: The measurement of the individual components does not change the total value of the conserved quantity. If the system starts with a total $L_z$ of $-1\\hbar$, the final state's components must sum to yield a total $L_z$ of $-1\\hbar$.\n*   **Formal Calculation (Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients)**: The probability is formally given by the square of the magnitude of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which connects the coupled and uncoupled bases: $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$. In this case, $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. By definition, Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are zero unless $m=m_1+m_2$. Since this condition is violated, the coefficient is zero, and thus the probability is zero.\n*   **Distinguishing Possible vs. Impossible Outcomes**: For this initial state ($m=-1$), a measurement of ($m_1=0, m_2=-1$) or ($m_1=-1, m_2=0$) would be possible and would have a non-zero probability. The specific outcome requested, ($m_1=-1, m_2=-1$), is impossible.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the joint probability of the specified measurement outcome is exactly 0. All 15 candidate answers arrived at this same numerical conclusion based on this unambiguous physical principle.\n\nThe provided options are A) 0, B) 1/2, C) 2/3, D) 1.

This is the most important piece of information. It means the system has a definite, well-defined total z-component of angular momentum, and the value of its corresponding quantum number is -1.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Final State (The Measurement Outcome)**: A measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state is described in the *uncoupled basis*.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law**: The core physical principle governing this problem is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum when adding angular momenta. The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship leads to a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    \n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    \n    This rule states that a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be a superposition of uncoupled states where the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is equal to `m`. Any measurement outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We now check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state by applying the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Their sum is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n    *   Comparing the initial requirement with the final outcome: **$-1 \\neq -2$**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability**: The selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated. This means the desired measurement outcome is physically forbidden by the law of conservation of angular momentum. The probability of an event that is physically impossible is **0**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Conservation Laws are Absolute**: In quantum mechanics, a selection rule derived from a fundamental conservation law (like the conservation of angular momentum) is not an approximation. Its violation implies that the probability of the event is exactly zero.\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis**: The initial state is given in the coupled basis $|l, m\\rangle$, which is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum. The measurement projects this state onto the uncoupled basis $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$. The connection between these bases is made via Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which are defined to be zero unless the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied.\n*   **Orthogonality**: A more formal way to see this is to recognize that the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state, characterized by $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, is an eigenstate of the same $L_z$ operator but with eigenvalue $(-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) that correspond to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal.

This corresponds to the first electron being found in a state with individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   The measurement of $L_{2z}$ yields an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the second electron being found in a state with individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law:**\n    In quantum mechanics, the addition of angular momentum follows a strict conservation law for the z-component. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship imposes a definitive selection rule on their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    This rule means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be composed of, or measured to be in, uncoupled states where the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) equals $m$. Any outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    We must now check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state based on the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is fixed: **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired final measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is: **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:**\n    We compare the value of $m$ from the initial state with the value of $m_1 + m_2$ from the desired final state.\n    *   The conservation law requires $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   In our case, this becomes the statement: $-1 = -2$.\n    This is false. The desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that is forbidden by a conservation law has a probability of exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Decisive Factor**: The solution hinges entirely on the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum ($m = m_1 + m_2$). The values of the total angular momentum quantum numbers ($l_1, l_2, l$) are not needed for this specific calculation once the initial $m$ is known.\n*   **Orthogonality**: A more formal way to understand this is through the orthogonality of eigenstates. The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state, corresponding to $m_1=-1, m_2=-1$, is part of a subspace that is an eigenstate of the same $L_z$ operator but with a different eigenvalue, $(-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of measuring one state from another is the square of the inner product (the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient in this case), which is zero for orthogonal states.\n*   **Consensus in Reasoning**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identified the reasoning outlined above. The physics is unambiguous, and every agent concluded that the probability must be 0. Discrepancies in the final letter choices (e.g., some choosing A, B, C, or D) are clearly mapping errors where the agent either misread the options or made a mistake in associating their correct numerical answer (0) with the corresponding letter. The core physical analysis is sound across all samples.\n\nBased on the universally agreed-upon physical reasoning, the probability is 0. According to the options provided in the question: A) 0, B) 2/3, C) 1/2, D) 1. The correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial Quantum State\nThe system of two electrons is in the coupled angular momentum state described by the ket:\n$|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$\nThis notation provides the following key information:\n*   $l_1 = 1, l_2 = 1$: The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons.\n*   $l = 2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the combined system.\n*   **$m = -1$**: The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum. This is the most crucial piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. Any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum on this state must, with certainty, yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Desired Measurement Outcome\nThe question asks for the joint probability of a specific measurement on the individual components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n*   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is measured to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the first electron having an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n*   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also measured to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the second electron having an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\nThis desired outcome corresponds to finding the system in a state where the individual quantum numbers are $(-1, -1)$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Law of Conservation\nThe core physical principle governing this problem is the addition of angular momentum in quantum mechanics. Specifically, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the simple sum of the individual z-components. The operator relationship is:\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThis leads to a strict **selection rule** for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n**$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n\nThis rule means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be a superposition of uncoupled states where the sum of the individual quantum numbers `m₁` and `m₂` is equal to `m`. If this rule is not satisfied for a potential outcome, that outcome is physically impossible to measure from the given initial state.\n\n### Step 4: Check for Consistency\nWe must check if the desired measurement outcome is physically possible by applying the selection rule.\n*   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n*   For the desired final measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\nNow, we compare the two values. The selection rule requires $m = m_1 + m_2$. In our case, this would require:\n$-1 = -2$\nThis is a false statement.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Probability\nSince the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically forbidden. Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points and Synthesis of Candidate Answers\n1.  **Unanimous Reasoning**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identified the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum ($m = m_1 + m_2$) as the decisive principle.\n2.  **Correct Calculation**: All candidates correctly calculated that the initial state has $m=-1$ while the desired final state would require a total of $m_1+m_2=-2$.\n3.  **Correct Conclusion**: All candidates correctly concluded that since $-1 \\neq -2$, the event is impossible and its probability is 0.\n4.  **No Complex Calculations Needed**: It is not necessary to calculate any Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The selection rule is sufficient to immediately find the answer. The probability is given by $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$, and this Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero by definition because the selection rule is violated.\n5.  **Mapping to Options**: The only point of failure in some candidate answers was incorrectly mapping the numerical result \"0\" to the given multiple-choice letters. Given the options A) 0, B) 2/3, C) 1, D) 1/2, the probability of 0 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and adding key points for clarity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial Quantum State:**\n    The system is given in the *coupled basis*, represented by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Let's break down this notation:\n    *   $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$: These are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons. An $l=1$ state corresponds to a p-orbital.\n    *   $l=2$: This is the quantum number for the magnitude of the *total* orbital angular momentum of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m=-1$: This is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum. This is the most critical piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of a specific measurement outcome on the *individual* electrons:\n    *   The eigenvalue of the first electron's $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number of $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the second electron's $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number of $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state corresponds to finding the system in a state where the individual z-components are known, which is a state in the *uncoupled basis*.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (Selection Rule):**\n    A core principle of adding angular momenta in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component. The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the direct sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    This relationship imposes a strict selection rule on their corresponding quantum numbers. For a measurement to be possible, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$ and $m_2$) in the final state must equal the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the initial state.\n    **Selection Rule: $m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    If this condition is not met, the transition from the initial state to the final measured state is forbidden.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    We must check if the desired measurement outcome is physically possible by applying the selection rule:\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Their sum is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:**\n    Now we compare the total quantum number required by the initial state with the sum from the desired final state.\n    *   Is $m = m_1 + m_2$?\n    *   Is $-1 = -2$? **No, this is false.**\n\nSince the desired measurement outcome violates the law of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is a physically impossible event. The probability of an impossible event is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Basis States**: The initial state is given in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$), where the total angular momentum is defined. The measurement outcome is described in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$), where the individual components are defined. The connection between these bases is governed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **The Critical Information**: The entire problem is solved by focusing on the magnetic quantum numbers ($m, m_1, m_2$). The total angular momentum quantum numbers ($l, l_1, l_2$) are consistent ($|1-1| \\le 2 \\le 1+1$ is true), but they are not needed to evaluate the probability of this specific outcome.\n*   **Underlying Mathematics**: The probability is formally given by the square of the magnitude of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. These coefficients are zero by definition if the selection rule $m=m_1+m_2$ is not satisfied. Thus, the probability is $0^2=0$.\n*   **Consensus**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identify this reasoning and unanimously conclude that the probability is 0. The discrepancies in their final letter choice are mapping errors; the physics conclusion is sound.\n\nThe calculated probability is 0, which corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State:** The system is described in the *coupled basis* by the state ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1=1, l_2=1$: The two electrons are in p-orbitals.\n    *   $l=2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n    *   $m=-1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the **total** angular momentum. This is the most critical piece of information. It means the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Final State (The Measurement Outcome):** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the *individual* z-components of angular momentum and getting:\n    *   $L_{1z}$ eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   $L_{2z}$ eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state corresponds to the *uncoupled* basis state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle = |-1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law:** A core principle in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum when adding momenta. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $$m = m_1 + m_2$$\n    This rule means that for a system to be in a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number $m$, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$ and $m_2$) of any possible measured state *must* equal $m$.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We apply the selection rule to the problem:\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Their sum is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability:** We compare the required total from the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum from the desired final state ($m_1+m_2=-2$). Since **$-1 \\neq -2$**, the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Such an event is physically impossible. The probability of a physically impossible event is **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Basis States**: It is essential to distinguish between the coupled basis $|l, m\\rangle$ (which describes the system as a whole) and the uncoupled basis $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ (which describes the individual parts). The initial state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operators, while the measurement projects the system onto eigenstates of the individual component operators.\n*   **The Selection Rule is Absolute**: The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not an approximation; it is an exact consequence of the definition of total angular momentum. If the rule is violated, the probability is not just small, it is exactly zero.\n*   **No Need for Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients**: While the formal way to calculate the probability involves a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ($P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$), one does not need to look up the value of this coefficient. By definition, all Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are zero if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met.\n\nThe physical reasoning is unambiguous and unanimously supported by all the candidate answers. The probability of the specified event is 0.

A step-by-step analysis is required to determine the probability of a specific measurement outcome.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State of the System.**\n    The system consists of two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state, described by the ket notation $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$: These are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons. An l-value of 1 corresponds to a p-orbital.\n    *   $l=2$: This is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the combined two-electron system.\n    *   $m=-1$: This is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum. This is the most crucial piece of information for solving the problem. It signifies that the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Desired Measurement Outcome.**\n    A joint measurement is to be performed on the individual z-components of the angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining the following result:\n    *   The measured eigenvalue for the first electron's $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The measured eigenvalue for the second electron's $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (The Selection Rule).**\n    In quantum mechanics, the addition of angular momenta follows a strict conservation law for the z-component. The total z-component operator is the direct sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    This relationship imposes a strict **selection rule** on their corresponding quantum numbers. For any possible measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$ and $m_2$) must equal the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the initial state.\n    **Selection Rule: $m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    A measurement outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check if the Desired Outcome is Physically Possible.**\n    We must apply the selection rule to our specific scenario.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is precisely **m = -1**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n    *   We then check if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied. In this case, we check if $-1 = -2$. This statement is **false**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability.**\n    Since the desired measurement outcome violates the fundamental law of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it represents a physically impossible event. The probability of an impossible event is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Orthogonality**: The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with an eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state, characterized by $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$, is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with an eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) that correspond to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. The probability of transitioning from one state to another upon measurement is the squared magnitude of their inner product, which is zero for orthogonal states.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients**: Formally, the probability is given by the squared magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient connecting the initial and final states: $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are, by definition, zero unless the selection rule $m = m_1+m_2$ is satisfied. Since the rule is violated, the coefficient is zero, and the probability is zero.\n*   **Irrelevance of `l=2`**: While the total angular momentum quantum number `l=2` is given, it is not strictly necessary to solve this particular question, which can be fully resolved using the conservation of the z-component ($m$) alone.\n\nBased on this analysis, the probability is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the key points from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State and Its Properties**: The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the *coupled basis* as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The critical information from this notation is:\n    *   The individual angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\n    *   The total angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number for the **total** z-component of angular momentum is **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, and a measurement of the total z-component will always yield the eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome**: A joint measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining a specific outcome:\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This desired final state corresponds to the *uncoupled basis* state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (Selection Rule)**: The core principle that governs this problem is the addition of angular momentum. The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual components. This relationship between the operators ($L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$) imposes a strict selection rule on their quantum numbers:\n    $$m = m_1 + m_2$$\n    This rule means that a state with a total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be found in a configuration where the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$, $m_2$) sum to $m$. Any outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check if the Desired Outcome is Possible**: We must check if the desired outcome is consistent with the initial state by applying the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability**: We compare the required total from the initial state (`-1`) with the sum from the desired final state (`-2`). Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event forbidden by a conservation law has a probability of exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis**: It is essential to recognize that the problem starts in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and asks about a measurement result in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The connection between these bases is governed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **The `m = m₁ + m₂` Selection Rule**: This is a strict, non-negotiable rule. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is defined to be zero unless this condition is met. The probability is the square of this coefficient, so it is also zero.\n*   **Eigenstates and Conservation**: The initial state is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The final desired state is an eigenstate of the same operator, but with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$. Since these eigenvalues are different, the states are orthogonal, and the probability of transitioning from one to the other is zero. This reflects the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n*   **Ignoring other information**: The values of $l_1$, $l_2$, and $l$ are not needed to solve this specific problem, as the selection rule on the magnetic quantum numbers is sufficient to reach the conclusion.\n\nBased on this unanimous reasoning, the joint probability is 0. According to the options given in the problem description:\n\nA) 2/3\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 1/2\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State:** The problem begins by defining the initial quantum state of the two-electron system in the *coupled basis* as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$: Each electron has an individual orbital angular momentum quantum number of 1 (they are in p-orbitals).\n    *   $l=2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number for the system is 2.\n    *   **$m=-1$**: This is the most critical piece of information. The total magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the system's angular momentum is definitively -1. This means the state is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z$, with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome:** A joint measurement of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. We need to find the probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state corresponds to the system being found in the *uncoupled* state with individual quantum numbers $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law:** In quantum mechanics, when adding angular momenta, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. The operator relationship is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict and powerful selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    This rule is fundamental. It means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be composed of, or measured to be in, uncoupled states where the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is exactly equal to $m$.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state according to this conservation law.\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is fixed: **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual quantum numbers would be: **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:** The selection rule requires $m = m_1 + m_2$. Let's compare the values:\n    *   Required by initial state: $m = -1$\n    *   Result from final state: $m_1+m_2 = -2$\n    Since **$-1 \\neq -2$**, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible. The probability of such an event is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Basis Mismatch:** The problem starts in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and asks about a measurement in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The selection rule $m=m_1+m_2$ is the critical bridge between these two descriptions.\n*   **Eigenstates and Orthogonality:** The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state (with $m_1=-1, m_2=-1$) is an eigenstate of the same $L_z$ operator but with a different eigenvalue, $-2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of transitioning from one state to an orthogonal one is zero.\n*   **No Calculation Needed:** The power of the selection rule is that it acts as a \"veto\". Since the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, we know the probability is zero without needing to compute any Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or perform a full basis expansion. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is by definition zero.\n*   **Consensus Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers correctly identified and applied this conservation law, arriving at the correct numerical result of 0. The confusion in the candidate answers was solely in mapping this number to the correct multiple-choice letter, a trivial error that does not affect the physical reasoning.\n\nBased on the unambiguous physical principle, the probability is 0. According to the options provided in the question:\nA) 2/3\nB) 1\nC) 1/2\nD) 0\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the question and the reasoning provided by the candidate agents, here is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State**: The system is in the *coupled basis* state given by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The most important piece of information for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome**: The question asks for the probability of a joint measurement on the *individual* components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The desired outcome is:\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law**: The core principle governing the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of its z-component. The total operator $L_z$ is the sum of the individual operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict **selection rule** for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    This rule dictates that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be measured to be in an uncoupled configuration of `(m₁, m₂)` if their sum equals `m`. If the condition is not met, the transition is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We must check if the desired outcome is consistent with the initial state using the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **m = -1**.\n    *   For the desired final state, the sum of the individual quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability**: We compare the required total m-value from the initial state (`-1`) with the sum from the final state (`-2`).\n    Since **-1 ≠ -2**, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically forbidden. Therefore, the probability of this event occurring is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis**: The initial state is in the coupled basis, which describes the total angular momentum of the system. The measurement outcome is described in the uncoupled basis, which describes the individual components. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which are used to transform between these bases, are zero if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met.\n*   **The Nature of the Selection Rule**: This rule is absolute, not probabilistic. It defines what is physically possible. A violation means the probability is precisely zero, not just small.\n*   **Unanimity of Reasoning**: All 15 candidate answers, despite having different multiple-choice options, correctly identify this conservation law and unanimously conclude that the probability is 0. The discrepancies are only in mapping this number to a letter, which points to inconsistent problem data being given to them. The underlying physics, however, is undisputed.\n\nGiven the numerical answer is 0 and the options provided in the prompt are A) 2/3, B) 1, C) 1/2, D) 0, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the consensus reasoning from the provided candidate answers, we can determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State**: The problem describes a two-electron system in a *coupled angular momentum state*, represented by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The critical information here is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This value is definite for the initial state, meaning the system is an eigenstate of the operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. A measurement of the total $L_z$ would yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$ with certainty.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Desired Measurement Outcome**: The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the *individual* z-components of angular momentum for each electron and getting the eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for both. This corresponds to a final state with the following individual magnetic quantum numbers:\n    *   First electron: $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   Second electron: $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (Selection Rule)**: The core physical principle governing the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. This leads to a strict selection rule that connects the coupled and uncoupled bases: the total magnetic quantum number must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers.\n    **Selection Rule:** $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    A transition from an initial state to a final state is only possible if this rule is satisfied. If the rule is violated, the probability of that outcome is zero.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We must check if the desired outcome is physically consistent with the initial state by applying the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = **-2**$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability**: We compare the required total `m` from the initial state (`-1`) with the sum from the desired final state (`-2`). Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible. Therefore, the probability of this measurement occurring is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Eigenstates and Definite Values**: The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator $L_z$. This means the value $m=-1$ is a definite property of the system, not a probabilistic one.\n*   **The Power of the Selection Rule**: The rule $m=m_1+m_2$ is a powerful first check. In many quantum mechanics problems involving angular momentum, one might need to use Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to find probabilities. However, these coefficients are defined to be zero if the selection rule is violated, providing an immediate answer without further calculation.\n*   **Distinguishing Total vs. Individual Components**: It is crucial to distinguish between the total magnetic quantum number `m` of the system and the individual components `m₁` and `m₂`. The question sets up an initial state with a known total `m` and asks about the probability of measuring specific individual components.\n\nThe analysis unanimously leads to the conclusion that the probability is 0. Matching this to the given options:\n\nA) 1\nB) 1/2\nC) 0\nD) 2/3\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State**: The system is described in the coupled angular momentum basis by the state ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Let's break this down:\n    *   $l_1=1, l_2=1$: Each of the two electrons is in a p-orbital state.\n    *   $l=2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m=-1$: The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum. This is the most important piece of information. It means the system is in a definite eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator ($L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$), and any measurement of the total z-component must yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome**: A joint measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining:\n    *   Eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$, which means the first electron is in a state with individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   Eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$, which means the second electron is in a state with individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (Selection Rule)**: In the addition of angular momenta, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the simple sum of the individual z-components. This physical law imposes a strict selection rule on their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $$m = m_1 + m_2$$\n    This rule is fundamental. It means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number $m$ is a superposition of only those uncoupled states for which the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is equal to $m$. A measurement outcome that violates this rule is physically forbidden.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We must check if the desired outcome is physically possible given the initial state and the conservation law.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability**: We compare the total quantum number required by the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum produced by the desired final state ($m_1+m_2 = -2$).\n    $$ -1 \\neq -2 $$\n    Since the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met, the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible. Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Basis Transformation**: The problem connects a state in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) with a potential measurement outcome in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The probability of this is related to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which are defined to be zero unless the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is met.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates**: A more formal way to see this is that the initial state is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state would be an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. The probability of measuring a state to be in another state that is orthogonal to it is zero.\n*   **Unanimity of Reasoning**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identify and apply this reasoning, concluding unanimously that the probability is 0. The discrepancies in their final letter choices stem from the options being presented in a different order for each.\n\nBased on the sound and unanimous physical reasoning, the probability is 0. Matching this to the provided options: A) 1, B) 1/2, C) 2/3, D) 0. The correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe system of two electrons is described in the coupled basis by the ket:\n$|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n\nFrom this notation, we extract the following quantum numbers:\n*   **$l_1=1, l_2=1$**: These are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons. They are in p-orbitals.\n*   **$l=2$**: This is the quantum number for the magnitude of the *total* orbital angular momentum of the system.\n*   **$m=-1$**: This is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum. This is the most critical piece of information for this problem. It signifies that the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n### Step 2: Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome\nA joint measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of the angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining a specific result for both electrons:\n*   The measurement of $L_{1z}$ yields the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the first electron being in a state with an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n*   The measurement of $L_{2z}$ yields the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the second electron being in a state with an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\nThis desired final state would have a total z-component angular momentum corresponding to the quantum number $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (The Selection Rule)\nThe core physical principle that governs this problem is the addition of angular momenta. A fundamental law of quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the direct sum of the individual z-components.\nOperator relationship: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThis operator relationship imposes a strict and inviolable **selection rule** on their corresponding quantum numbers:\n**$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n\nThis means that a coupled state with a definite total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be composed of uncoupled states for which the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is exactly equal to $m$. Any measurement outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Desired Outcome is Possible\nLet's apply the selection rule to our specific case:\n*   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **$m = -1$**.\n*   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   The sum of these individual quantum numbers for the desired outcome is: **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\nNow, we compare the total quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum required by the final state ($m_1+m_2 = -2$). The selection rule requires $m = m_1 + m_2$. For our problem, this would mean:\n$-1 = -2$\nThis statement is false.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Probability\nSince the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is a **physically impossible** event. The probability of an event that is forbidden by a fundamental conservation law is exactly **0**.\n\nMore formally, the probability of finding the system in the state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$ is the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are, by definition, zero unless $m=m_1+m_2$. Since this rule is violated, the coefficient is zero, and so is the probability.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   The most crucial part of the initial state ket $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$ is the last number, $m=-1$, which represents a definite total value.\n*   The most crucial part of the question is that a measurement on *both* electrons results in an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$, which means the final state must have $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$.\n*   The entire problem is solvable by simply checking the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$. It is unnecessary to calculate the full Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the expansion of the initial state. The violation of this single rule immediately tells you the probability is zero.\n*   It is important to map the calculated numerical answer (0) to the correct letter option provided in the question.\n\nBased on the analysis, the joint probability is 0. The options are A) 2/3, B) 0, C) 1/2, D) 1. The correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State:** The system is in the *coupled angular momentum basis* state, represented by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Let's break down the quantum numbers:\n    *   $l_1 = 1, l_2 = 1$: The two electrons each have an orbital angular momentum quantum number of 1 (they are in p-orbitals).\n    *   $l = 2$: This is the quantum number for the magnitude of the *total* orbital angular momentum of the system.\n    *   $m = -1$: This is the quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum. This is the most crucial piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the probability of a specific joint measurement outcome on the *individual* electrons:\n    *   The measurement of $L_{1z}$ (for electron 1) yields an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The measurement of $L_{2z}$ (for electron 2) also yields an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state belongs to the *uncoupled basis*.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law:** A core principle of quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum during the addition process. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This physical law imposes a strict **selection rule** on the corresponding quantum numbers: for a state to be possible, the total magnetic quantum number must equal the sum of the individual ones.\n    $$m = m_1 + m_2$$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is physically possible given the initial state and the conservation law.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = \\mathbf{-2}$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability:** Let's apply the selection rule: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    Is $-1 = -2$? **No.**\n    The desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. A system that is known to have a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$ cannot be measured and found in a final configuration that has a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$. Such an event is physically impossible. The probability of a physically impossible event is **0**.\n\n### Careful Points and Analysis of Candidate Answers\n*   **Unanimous Reasoning:** All the provided candidate answers correctly identify the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ as the key to solving the problem. They all correctly apply it and conclude that since $-1 \\neq (-1) + (-1)$, the probability must be 0.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** The probability is formally calculated as the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient connecting the initial and final states: $P = |\\langle l_1,m_1; l_2,m_2 | l,m \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1,-1; 1,-1 | 2,-1 \\rangle|^2$. These coefficients are defined to be zero unless $m=m_1+m_2$, confirming the probability is exactly 0.\n*   **Inconsistent Final Letter Choice:** The candidate answers disagree on the final letter (A, B, C, or D).
