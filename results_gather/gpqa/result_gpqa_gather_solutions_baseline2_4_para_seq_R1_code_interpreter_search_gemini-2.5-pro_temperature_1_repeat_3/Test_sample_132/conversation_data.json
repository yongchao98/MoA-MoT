All agents who showed their work followed the same logical path and arrived at the same numerical answer. The discrepancy in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) across different answers confirms that the options were presented in a randomized order.

Calculate Initial Molar Concentrations**\nFirst, we calculate the concentrations of the primary components of the buffer system: the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻.\n\n*   **Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄):**\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n\n*   **Moles of HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O):**\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n\n*   **Solution Volume:**\n    The volume is 200.00 cm³, which must be converted to Liters for molarity calculations.

Kₐ₂ must be used to find the [H⁺] from the main `H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻` buffer. Then, Kₐ₃ must be used with that [H⁺] to find the final `[PO₄³⁻]`. Ka₁ is not used.\n*   **Buffer Approximation:** It is valid to assume that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations, as the extent of further dissociation is very small.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation yields a final concentration for the orthophosphate ion of approximately 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M.

It is crucial to use the mass of the hydrate as specified, not the anhydrous form.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\nThe solution volume is 200.00 cm³, which must be converted to Liters (0.20000 L).\n*   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = (1.00 g) / (136.09 g/mol) = 0.007348 mol\n    [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = **0.03674 M**\n*   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = (1.00 g) / (177.99 g/mol) = 0.005618 mol\n    [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = **0.02809 M**\n\n**Careful Point 2: Select the correct acid dissociation constant (Kₐ) for each equilibrium.**\nThe H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ buffer is governed by Kₐ₂, while the formation of PO₄³⁻ is governed by Kₐ₃.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺].**\nThe [H⁺] is determined by the main buffer equilibrium (H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻), which is governed by Kₐ₂.\n*   Kₐ₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Kₐ₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] ≈ **8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M**\n\n**Careful Point 3: Use the [H⁺] from the buffer to solve the second equilibrium.**\nThe concentration of orthophosphate, [PO₄³⁻], is very low and depends on the [H⁺] established by the much more concentrated buffer components.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration, [PO₄³⁻].**\nThis is found using the third dissociation equilibrium (HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻), governed by Kₐ₃.\n*   Kₐ₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Kₐ₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation robustly yields a concentration for the orthophosphate ion of approximately 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M. Rounding to three significant figures gives **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**.\n\nThis numerical result is confirmed by every candidate answer that provided a detailed calculation. The final step is to match this confirmed value to the options provided in the question:\nA) 3.97x10^-7 M\nB) 5.48x10^-7 M\nC) 2.81x10^-7 M\nD) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value of 6.24x10⁻⁷ M is a direct match for option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
