This is calculated by finding the mole fraction (`α₂`) of this species and converting it to a percentage.\n\n2.  **Verify the Chemical Formula**: All candidate answers correctly identified the standard formula for calculating the mole fraction of a species `[MLₙ]` in a complexation equilibrium. For the species of interest `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where n=2, the formula is:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n3.  **Confirm the Calculation**: There is a unanimous consensus among all candidate answers on the numerical calculation.\n    *   **Given values**: `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M, `β₁`=9, `β₂`=40, `β₃`=63, `β₄`=16.\n    *   **Numerator Calculation**: `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n    *   **Denominator Calculation**:\n        *   Term for `Co²⁺` (free ion, `β₀=1`): **1**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × 0.1² = **0.4**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × 0.1³ = **0.063**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × 0.1⁴ = **0.0016**\n        *   **Sum of Denominator**: 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n    *   **Mole Fraction and Percentage**:\n        `α₂` = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n        Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\nThe calculation is robustly confirmed across all sources to be approximately 16.9%.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration. A key and valid assumption is made here: because the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times higher than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of bound ligand is small. Therefore, it's a standard approximation to use the total concentration (`[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M) in the calculation. All candidate agents correctly identified this point.\n2.  **Role of Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M`) is not directly used in the mole fraction formula itself but is essential for justifying the assumption about the ligand concentration mentioned above.\n3.  **Inclusion of all Species**: It is critical that the denominator includes the term for the free metal ion (`1`) in addition to the terms for all the complexes (`[Co(SCN)]⁺` to `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`). Omitting any term would lead to an incorrect result. This was handled correctly in all analyses.\n4.  **Error Source in Candidate Answers**: The calculation yielding 16.9% is unanimous. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) among the candidate answers are clearly due to those agents being presented with shuffled versions of the multiple-choice options. The scientific and mathematical conclusion, however, is not in dispute.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is robustly calculated to be **16.9%**. We must now match this correct numerical result to the specific list of options provided in the question:\n\nA) 25.6%\nB) 42.3%\nC) 38.1%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis task requires a meta-analysis of multiple agents' answers to a chemistry problem, followed by a definitive, step-by-step solution to determine the correct option.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers\n\nA review of all the provided answers reveals a strong consensus on the core scientific and mathematical aspects of the problem:\n1.  **Correct Principle:** All agents correctly identify that the problem requires calculating the mole fraction (α) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) species.\n2.  **Correct Formula:** All agents use the correct formula: `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[SCN⁻]ⁱ)`.\n3.  **Unanimous Calculation:** All agents perform the calculation correctly, arriving at the same numerical result of approximately **16.9%**.\n4.  **Source of Discrepancy:** The only inconsistencies are in the final letter (A, B, C, or D) chosen. This indicates that the multiple-choice options were presented in a different order to each agent, but the underlying calculation and result are unanimously agreed upon.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\nTo determine the correct answer, we will perform the calculation from first principles and match it to the options presented in the question.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is the mole fraction of the species, `α₂`, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. State the Governing Formula**\nThe mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution is determined by the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants `β`. The formula is:\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\nFor our target complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂`:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. List and Justify Careful Points and Assumptions**\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The formula uses the *free* ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. We are given the *total* concentration (0.1 M). Since the total ligand concentration is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (`0.1 M` vs. `10⁻² M` or `0.01 M`), it is a valid and standard approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration. Therefore, we use `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`.\n*   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is not required to calculate the relative percentage, as it cancels out in the derivation of the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Denominator Components:** The denominator must account for *all* cobalt-containing species. This includes the free `Co²⁺` ion (represented by the '1' term, where `β₀` is defined as 1) and all four thiocyanato complexes.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nUsing the given values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁`=9, `β₂`=40, `β₃`=63, `β₄`=16\n\n**Calculate the numerator:**\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n**Calculate the denominator:**\nDenominator = 1 + (β₁[SCN⁻]¹) + (β₂[SCN⁻]²) + (β₃[SCN⁻]³) + (β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\nDenominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nDenominator = **2.3646**\n\n**Calculate the mole fraction (`α₂`) and convert to a percentage:**\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\nPercentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**5. Final Decision**\nThe calculation unambiguously shows that the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is **16.9%**. We now match this result to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 38.1%\nB) 42.3%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n**Analysis of the Problem and Candidate Answers**\n\n1.  **Goal Identification**: The objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction of this species (`α₂`) and expressing it as a percentage.\n\n2.  **Principle and Formula**: All provided candidate answers correctly identify the governing principle of complexation equilibria and use the standard formula for the mole fraction of the n-th complex:\n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n    For the specific complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, this becomes:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Careful Points and Assumptions**:\n    *   **Ligand Concentration**: A key point, noted by all agents, is the justification for using the total ligand concentration as the free ligand concentration. Since the total thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total cobalt concentration (c(Co) = 0.01 M), the ligand is in large excess. This makes the approximation `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M valid and standard practice.\n    *   **Denominator Term**: It is crucial to include the term '1' in the denominator, which represents the free `Co²⁺` ion (for which β₀=1). Forgetting this term would lead to an incorrect result. All agents correctly included this term.\n    *   **Irrelevance of c(Co)**: The total cobalt concentration is not needed for the calculation of a *relative* percentage (mole fraction), as it cancels out in the derivation.\n\n4.  **Calculation Verification**: All 15 candidate answers perform the exact same calculation, yielding a unanimous numerical result. This provides very high confidence in the calculation. Let's verify it once more:\n    *   **Numerator**: This term corresponds to `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n        Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n    *   **Denominator**: This term corresponds to the sum of all species.\n        Denominator = 1 + (β₁[SCN⁻]¹) + (β₂[SCN⁻]²) + (β₃[SCN⁻]³) + (β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n        Denominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\n        Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n    *   **Mole Fraction and Percentage**:\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n        Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n5.  **Final Decision**: The calculation is robustly confirmed by all sources to be approximately 16.9%. The only discrepancy among the candidate answers is which letter (A, B, C, or D) corresponds to this value, as they were likely presented with different option orders. To provide the correct answer, we must match our confirmed result to the list of options in the original question prompt:\n    *   A) 25.6%\n    *   B) 16.9%\n    *   C) 42.3%\n    *   D) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value of **16.9%** matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis is a quantitative analysis problem in coordination chemistry. To determine the correct answer, we must first analyze the consensus among the provided solutions and then perform a rigorous, step-by-step verification of the calculation.\n\n### Analysis of Provided Answers\nAll 15 candidate answers agree on the following core points:\n1.  **Correct Formula**: All agents correctly identify the formula for the mole fraction (`αₙ`) of a metal complex based on stability constants and free ligand concentration.\n2.  **Correct Numerical Result**: All agents, whether through manual calculation or Python code, arrive at the same numerical result of approximately **16.9%**.\n3.  **Source of Discrepancy**: The variation in the final letters chosen (A, B, C, or D) stems from the fact that each agent was presented with a different ordering of the multiple-choice options.\n\nThis unanimous agreement on the numerical result provides extremely high confidence in the calculation itself. The final step is to perform this calculation and map the result to the specific options provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This is the mole fraction of the species, `α₂`, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. State the Governing Formula**\nThe mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` is given by:\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n\nFor the desired complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we are calculating `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Identify Values and Justify Assumptions**\n*   **Stability Constants**: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16.\n*   **Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. We are given the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is 10 times greater than the total metal concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M`), the ligand is in large excess. It is a standard and valid assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration as being equal to its total concentration. Therefore, **[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M**.\n*   **Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration is not needed to calculate the relative percentage, as it cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n*   **Numerator Calculation**: This term represents the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex.\n    Numerator = `β₂ × [SCN⁻]²` = `40 × (0.1)²` = `40 × 0.01` = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator Calculation**: This represents the sum of the terms for all possible cobalt species.\n    *   Term for free Co²⁺ (n=0): **1**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (n=1): `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (n=2): `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (n=3): `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (n=4): `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\n    Sum of Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016` = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation**:\n    `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = `0.4 / 2.3646` ≈ `0.16916`\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage**:\n    Percentage = `α₂ × 100%` ≈ `16.916%`\n\n**5. Final Decision**\nThe calculation unambiguously shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately **16.9%**. Matching this result to the provided options:\n\n*   **A) 16.9%**\n*   B) 42.3%\n*   C) 38.1%\n*   D) 25.6%\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on the candidate answers provided, a thorough step-by-step analysis reveals a unanimous consensus on the calculation method and the numerical result, with discrepancies only arising from the final mapping of the result to the multiple-choice letters.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal**: The objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This is the mole fraction of the species, `α₂`, expressed as a percentage.\n\n2.  **Governing Formula**: The mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution is determined by the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants `β`. The general formula is:\n    `αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n    For the specific complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n3.  **Calculation**: We substitute the given values into the formula:\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    *   **Numerator Calculation**: This is the term for the complex of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n        Numerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator Calculation**: This is the sum of terms for all possible species.\n        Denominator = `1` (for free Co²⁺) + `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` + `β₂[SCN⁻]²` + `β₃[SCN⁻]³` + `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴`\n        Denominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\n        Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\n        Denominator = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Mole Fraction and Percentage Calculation**:\n        `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n        Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All candidate agents correctly identified the formula and performed the calculation, unanimously arriving at the numerical result of **~16.9%**. The disagreement in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is a clerical error, likely because the options were presented to them in a different order. This overwhelming consensus on the calculation itself provides high confidence in the numerical result.\n2.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula uses the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times the total metal concentration (0.01 M), the ligand is in large excess. Therefore, approximating the free ligand concentration with the total concentration (`[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M) is a standard and valid assumption.\n3.  **Irrelevance of Total Metal Concentration**: The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not needed to calculate the *relative percentage* or mole fraction, as the free metal ion concentration term cancels out in the formula's derivation.\n4.  **Completeness of the Denominator**: It is crucial that the denominator includes the term `1` (representing the free metal ion) and the terms for *all* possible complexes to accurately reflect the total concentration of metal-containing species.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly yields a percentage of approximately 16.9%.

Identify the Correct Scientific Principle and Formula**\nIn a solution where a metal ion (`Co²⁺`) and a ligand (`SCN⁻`) form a series of complexes, the distribution of these species at equilibrium depends on the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (`β`). The mole fraction of a complex with 'n' ligands, `[MLₙ]`, is given by the general formula:\n\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n\nFor the specific complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where n=2, the formula is:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Perform the Calculation**\nWe use the values provided in the question:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator term, which corresponds to the desired complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n*   **Numerator** = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, which is the sum of terms for all possible species (including the free Co²⁺ ion, represented by the term '1'):\n*   Term for `Co²⁺` (n=0): **1**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (n=1): `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × (0.1)¹ = **0.9**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (n=2): `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (n=3): `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (n=4): `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nNow, we sum these terms to get the denominator:\n*   **Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nFinally, we calculate the mole fraction `α₂` and convert it to a percentage:\n*   `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n*   **Percentage** = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Consensus:** All 15 candidate answers correctly identified the formula and performed the calculation, unanimously arriving at the numerical result of ~16.9%.

It is a standard and valid assumption to approximate this with the *total* ligand concentration (0.1 M) because the ligand is in large excess compared to the metal ion (0.1 M >> 0.01 M).\n*   **Denominator:** It is essential to include the term '1' in the denominator to account for the population of free `Co²⁺` ions.

This is the mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species, denoted as `α₂`, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. State the Governing Formula:**\nThe mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`. The formula is:\n\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n\nFor the specific complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where n=2, the formula is:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Address Key Assumptions and Values:**\n*   **Stability Constants:** We are given `β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, and `β₄=16`.\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** We are given `[SCN⁻]total = 0.1 M`. Since the total ligand concentration is in 10-fold excess compared to the total metal concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M`), it is a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration. Thus, we use `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`.\n*   **Free Metal Ion Term:** The '1' in the denominator represents the free `Co²⁺` ion (for which β₀ = 1) and is crucial for a correct calculation.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation:**\n*   **Calculate the Numerator** (the term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`):\n    Numerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Calculate the Denominator** (the sum of terms for all species):\n    Denominator = `1` (for Co²⁺) + `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` + `β₂[SCN⁻]²` + `β₃[SCN⁻]³` + `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴`\n    Denominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\n    Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\n    Denominator = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (α₂):**\n    `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage:**\n    Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Final Decision\nThe calculation robustly shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**. We now match this result to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 38.1%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 25.6%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% corresponds to option **B**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires calculating the relative percentage of a specific coordination complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) `[Co(SCN)₂]`, in an equilibrium mixture.

Understand the Goal:**\nThe objective is to find the percentage of cobalt that exists in the form of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species (`Co²⁺`, `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`). This is known as the mole fraction (α₂) of the species, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Formula:**\nThe mole fraction of a complex with 'n' ligands, denoted `[MLₙ]`, is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`. The governing formula is:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n\nFor the dithiocyanato complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, n=2, and the formula becomes:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Analyze Assumptions and Careful Points:**\n*   **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* (equilibrium) ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. We are given the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total metal concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M), the amount of ligand bound to the metal is small in comparison. Therefore, it is a standard and valid chemical assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration with the total concentration: `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n*   **The \"1\" in the Denominator:** This term represents the fraction of free metal ions `[Co²⁺]` (for which β₀ is defined as 1) and is crucial for the calculation. Forgetting it is a common error.\n*   **Relevance of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not required for the calculation of a relative percentage (mole fraction), as the term cancels out. It is primarily used to justify the assumption about the ligand concentration.\n*   **Consensus of Candidate Answers:** All 15 provided candidate answers correctly identified the formula and performed the calculation, unanimously arriving at a numerical result of approximately 16.9%.

This is the mole fraction of the species, denoted `α₂`, expressed as a percentage.\n\n2.  **Governing Equation**: The mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution with a metal `M` and ligand `L` is determined by the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants `βₙ`. The general formula is:\n    `αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n    The denominator is a summation over all possible complexes (from `i`=1 to the maximum `N=4`), plus a `1` term which represents the free metal ion `[Co²⁺]` (for which `β₀=1`). For our target species `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we use `n=2`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n3.  **Calculation**: We substitute the given values into the formula.\n    *   **Given Values**: `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M; `β₁`=9; `β₂`=40; `β₃`=63; `β₄`=16.\n    *   **Calculate the Numerator** (the term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`):\n        Numerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n    *   **Calculate the Denominator** (the sum of terms for all species):\n        *   Term for `Co²⁺` (i=0): `1`\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (i=1): `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (i=2): `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × 0.1² = **0.4**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (i=3): `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × 0.1³ = **0.063**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (i=4): `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × 0.1⁴ = **0.0016**\n        *   Sum of Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016` = **2.3646**\n    *   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (`α₂`)**:\n        `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    *   **Convert to Percentage**:\n        Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n4.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identified the formula and performed the calculation, unanimously arriving at the numerical result of **16.9%**.

A critical assumption is that since the total ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]total` (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total metal concentration `c(Co)` (0.01 M), the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the total concentration (`[SCN⁻]free ≈ 0.1 M`).

We are given a total ligand concentration `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` and a total metal concentration `c(Co) = 0.01 M`. Because the ligand is in 10-fold excess, the amount that binds to the metal is small relative to the total. Therefore, it is a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Irrelevance of Total Metal Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed to calculate the relative percentage (mole fraction), as it cancels out during the formula's derivation.\n\n**4.

State the Governing Chemical Principle and Formula**\nWhen a metal ion (M) and a ligand (L) are in solution, they form a series of complexes in equilibrium. The mole fraction `αₙ` of a specific complex `[MLₙ]` is a function of the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants `βᵢ`. The formula is:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n\nFor the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂` (where n=2):\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. List Careful Points and Justify Assumptions**\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The formula uses the *free* ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total metal concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M), the amount of ligand bound to cobalt is small relative to the total. Therefore, it is a valid and standard chemical approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration. We use `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n*   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not required for calculating the *relative percentage* or mole fraction, as it cancels out during the formula's derivation.\n*   **The '1' in the Denominator:** It is crucial to remember the '1' term in the denominator. It represents the fraction of the metal that remains as the free ion (`Co²⁺`), for which the stability constant β₀ is defined as 1.\n\n**4.

The formula is:\n    `αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n    where the sum in the denominator goes from i=1 to the maximum coordination number, and the `1` represents the free metal ion (for which β₀ = 1).\n    For our target species, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, the formula is:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:** We use the given values:\n    *   Stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n    *   Thiocyanate concentration: `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M (This approximation is valid as the total ligand concentration of 0.1 M is in 10-fold excess over the total metal concentration of 10⁻² M).\n\n    *   **Calculate the Numerator:** This is the term for our target complex.\n        `Numerator = β₂ × [SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    *   **Calculate the Denominator:** This is the sum of terms for all possible cobalt species.\n        `Denominator = 1 (for Co²⁺) + (β₁×0.1¹) + (β₂×0.1²) + (β₃×0.1³) + (β₄×0.1⁴)`\n        `Denominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)`\n        `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n        `Denominator = 2.3646`\n\n    *   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (`α₂`):**\n        `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n    *   **Convert to Percentage:**\n        `Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\nThe calculated percentage is approximately **16.9%**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   It is crucial to use the correct formula for mole fraction, remembering to include the term `1` in the denominator for the free metal ion.\n*   The assumption that the free ligand concentration equals the total ligand concentration is valid because the ligand is in large excess but is important to acknowledge.\n*   The total metal concentration `c(Co)` is not used directly in the mole fraction calculation but is essential for justifying the ligand concentration assumption.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe calculation definitively shows the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex to be **16.9%**.

Understand the Goal of the Question**\nThe objective is to determine the relative abundance of a specific chemical species, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, in a solution. The question asks for this abundance to be expressed as a percentage of all cobalt-containing species. This is a classic problem in equilibrium and coordination chemistry.\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Scientific Principle and Formula**\nWhen a metal ion (M) and a ligand (L) are in solution, they form a series of complexes `[ML]`, `[ML₂]`, etc., in equilibrium. The mole fraction, `αₙ`, of a specific complex `[MLₙ]` is given by the formula:\n\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `αₙ` is the mole fraction of the complex with 'n' ligands.\n*   `βₙ` is the overall stability constant for the formation of `[MLₙ]` from M and L.\n*   `[L]` is the concentration of the *free* (unbound) ligand at equilibrium.\n*   The sum `Σ` in the denominator runs over all possible complexes (from i=1 to the maximum coordination number, in this case 4).\n*   The `1` in the denominator represents the free metal ion, M (for which `β₀` is defined as 1).\n\nFor our target complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂`:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Evaluate the Data and State Assumptions (Careful Points)**\n*   **Ligand Concentration `[SCN⁻]`**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration. The problem gives a *total* thiocyanate concentration of 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M (0.01 M). Since the ligand is in a 10-fold excess compared to the metal, the amount of thiocyanate that gets bound into complexes is small relative to its total concentration. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration.\n    *   **Assumption:** `[SCN⁻] ≈ [SCN⁻]total = 0.1 M`. All candidate answers correctly made this assumption.\n*   **Total Metal Concentration `c(Co)`**: The value `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not directly needed for the calculation of the relative percentage (mole fraction). Its main purpose is to justify the assumption about the ligand concentration above.\n*   **Stability Constants**: The values `β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, and `β₄=16` are used directly in the formula.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nWe substitute the known values into the formula for `α₂`.\n\n*   **Calculate the Numerator** (the term for our species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`):\n    Numerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Calculate the Denominator** (the sum of terms for all cobalt species):\n    *   Term for free Co²⁺: **1**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × (0.1)¹ = **0.9**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\n    Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (`α₂`)**:\n    `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage**:\n    Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\nThe calculation robustly yields a value of **16.9%**. A review of all candidate answers shows they all reached this same numerical conclusion, confirming the correctness of the method. The confusion in their final lettered choices was due to inconsistent ordering of the multiple-choice options.\n\nWe must match our confirmed result to the options provided in the main question prompt:\nA) 16.9%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 42.3%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

A key and valid assumption is made here: because the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times higher than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of bound ligand is small. Therefore, it's a standard approximation to use the total concentration (`[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M) in the calculation. All candidate agents correctly identified this point.\n2.  **Role of Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M`) is not directly used in the mole fraction formula itself but is essential for justifying the assumption about the ligand concentration mentioned above.\n3.  **Inclusion of all Species**: It is critical that the denominator includes the term for the free metal ion (`1`) in addition to the terms for all the complexes (`[Co(SCN)]⁺` to `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`). Omitting any term would lead to an incorrect result. This was handled correctly in all analyses.\n4.  **Error Source in Candidate Answers**: The calculation yielding 16.9% is unanimous. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) among the candidate answers are clearly due to those agents being presented with shuffled versions of the multiple-choice options.

This is the mole fraction of the species, `α₂`, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. State the Governing Formula**\nThe mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution is determined by the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants `β`. The formula is:\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\nFor our target complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂`:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. List and Justify Careful Points and Assumptions**\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The formula uses the *free* ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. We are given the *total* concentration (0.1 M). Since the total ligand concentration is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (`0.1 M` vs. `10⁻² M` or `0.01 M`), it is a valid and standard approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration. Therefore, we use `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`.\n*   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is not required to calculate the relative percentage, as it cancels out in the derivation of the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Denominator Components:** The denominator must account for *all* cobalt-containing species. This includes the free `Co²⁺` ion (represented by the '1' term, where `β₀` is defined as 1) and all four thiocyanato complexes.\n\n**4.

This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction of this species (`α₂`) and expressing it as a percentage.\n\n2.  **Principle and Formula**: All provided candidate answers correctly identify the governing principle of complexation equilibria and use the standard formula for the mole fraction of the n-th complex:\n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n    For the specific complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, this becomes:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Careful Points and Assumptions**:\n    *   **Ligand Concentration**: A key point, noted by all agents, is the justification for using the total ligand concentration as the free ligand concentration. Since the total thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total cobalt concentration (c(Co) = 0.01 M), the ligand is in large excess. This makes the approximation `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M valid and standard practice.\n    *   **Denominator Term**: It is crucial to include the term '1' in the denominator, which represents the free `Co²⁺` ion (for which β₀=1). Forgetting this term would lead to an incorrect result. All agents correctly included this term.\n    *   **Irrelevance of c(Co)**: The total cobalt concentration is not needed for the calculation of a *relative* percentage (mole fraction), as it cancels out in the derivation.\n\n4.  **Calculation Verification**: All 15 candidate answers perform the exact same calculation, yielding a unanimous numerical result. This provides very high confidence in the calculation. Let's verify it once more:\n    *   **Numerator**: This term corresponds to `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n        Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n    *   **Denominator**: This term corresponds to the sum of all species.\n        Denominator = 1 + (β₁[SCN⁻]¹) + (β₂[SCN⁻]²) + (β₃[SCN⁻]³) + (β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n        Denominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\n        Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n    *   **Mole Fraction and Percentage**:\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n        Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n5.  **Final Decision**: The calculation is robustly confirmed by all sources to be approximately 16.9%. The only discrepancy among the candidate answers is which letter (A, B, C, or D) corresponds to this value, as they were likely presented with different option orders.

State the Governing Formula**\nThe mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` is given by:\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n\nFor the desired complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we are calculating `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Identify Values and Justify Assumptions**\n*   **Stability Constants**: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16.\n*   **Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. We are given the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is 10 times greater than the total metal concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M`), the ligand is in large excess. It is a standard and valid assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration as being equal to its total concentration. Therefore, **[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M**.\n*   **Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration is not needed to calculate the relative percentage, as it cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n*   **Numerator Calculation**: This term represents the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex.\n    Numerator = `β₂ × [SCN⁻]²` = `40 × (0.1)²` = `40 × 0.01` = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator Calculation**: This represents the sum of the terms for all possible cobalt species.\n    *   Term for free Co²⁺ (n=0): **1**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (n=1): `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (n=2): `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (n=3): `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (n=4): `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\n    Sum of Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016` = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation**:\n    `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = `0.4 / 2.3646` ≈ `0.16916`\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage**:\n    Percentage = `α₂ × 100%` ≈ `16.916%`\n\n**5. Final Decision**\nThe calculation unambiguously shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately **16.9%**. Matching this result to the provided options:\n\n*   **A) 16.9%**\n*   B) 42.3%\n*   C) 38.1%\n*   D) 25.6%\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on the candidate answers provided, a thorough step-by-step analysis reveals a unanimous consensus on the calculation method and the numerical result, with discrepancies only arising from the final mapping of the result to the multiple-choice letters.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal**: The objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This is the mole fraction of the species, `α₂`, expressed as a percentage.\n\n2.  **Governing Formula**: The mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution is determined by the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants `β`. The general formula is:\n    `αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n    For the specific complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n3.  **Calculation**: We substitute the given values into the formula:\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    *   **Numerator Calculation**: This is the term for the complex of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n        Numerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator Calculation**: This is the sum of terms for all possible species.\n        Denominator = `1` (for free Co²⁺) + `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` + `β₂[SCN⁻]²` + `β₃[SCN⁻]³` + `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴`\n        Denominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\n        Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\n        Denominator = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Mole Fraction and Percentage Calculation**:\n        `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n        Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All candidate agents correctly identified the formula and performed the calculation, unanimously arriving at the numerical result of **~16.9%**. The disagreement in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is a clerical error, likely because the options were presented to them in a different order. This overwhelming consensus on the calculation itself provides high confidence in the numerical result.\n2.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula uses the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times the total metal concentration (0.01 M), the ligand is in large excess. Therefore, approximating the free ligand concentration with the total concentration (`[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M) is a standard and valid assumption.\n3.  **Irrelevance of Total Metal Concentration**: The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not needed to calculate the *relative percentage* or mole fraction, as the free metal ion concentration term cancels out in the formula's derivation.\n4.  **Completeness of the Denominator**: It is crucial that the denominator includes the term `1` (representing the free metal ion) and the terms for *all* possible complexes to accurately reflect the total concentration of metal-containing species.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly yields a percentage of approximately 16.9%.

It only serves to justify the ligand concentration assumption.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Complete Denominator**: It is essential to include the term '1' in the denominator to account for the free `Co²⁺` ions. Forgetting this term is a common mistake.\n\n5.  **Final Decision**: The calculation robustly yields a percentage of approximately 16.9%.

This is known as the mole fraction (denoted as `α₂`) expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Scientific Principle and Formula**\nIn a solution where a metal ion (`Co²⁺`) and a ligand (`SCN⁻`) form a series of complexes, the distribution of these species at equilibrium depends on the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (`β`).

Since the total ligand concentration is in 10-fold excess compared to the total metal concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M`), it is a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration. Thus, we use `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`.\n*   **Free Metal Ion Term:** The '1' in the denominator represents the free `Co²⁺` ion (for which β₀ = 1) and is crucial for a correct calculation.\n\n**4.

Analyze Assumptions and Careful Points:**\n*   **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* (equilibrium) ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. We are given the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total metal concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M), the amount of ligand bound to the metal is small in comparison. Therefore, it is a standard and valid chemical assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration with the total concentration: `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n*   **The \"1\" in the Denominator:** This term represents the fraction of free metal ions `[Co²⁺]` (for which β₀ is defined as 1) and is crucial for the calculation. Forgetting it is a common error.\n*   **Relevance of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not required for the calculation of a relative percentage (mole fraction), as the term cancels out.

We must match this correct value to the options provided in the original question:\n    A) 38.1%\n    B) 16.9%\n    C) 42.3%\n    D) 25.6%\n    The calculated value matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration. A critical assumption is that since the total ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]total` (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total metal concentration `c(Co)` (0.01 M), the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the total concentration (`[SCN⁻]free ≈ 0.1 M`). This is a standard and valid approximation in such cases.\n*   **Denominator \"1\" Term**: A common error in this type of calculation is forgetting the `1` in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of free `Co²⁺` ions and is essential for obtaining the correct total sum of all cobalt-containing species.\n*   **Overall vs. Stepwise Constants**: The problem provides overall stability constants (`βₙ`), which are the correct constants to use in this formula. If stepwise constants (`Kₙ`) had been given, they would have needed to be converted first.\n*   **Irrelevant Information**: The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not directly needed for the calculation of the relative percentage (mole fraction), but it is crucial for justifying the ligand concentration assumption.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires calculating the mole fraction of a specific complex in an equilibrium mixture and expressing it as a percentage.

This is a clerical error, not a scientific or mathematical one. The unanimous agreement on the 16.9% value gives extremely high confidence in this result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\nTo confirm the result and select the correct option from the list provided in the question, we perform the calculation.\n\n**1. The Goal:**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species. This is the mole fraction (`α₂`) expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. The Formula:**\nThe mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution is given by:\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\nwhere:\n*   `L` is the ligand (`SCN⁻`)\n*   `βᵢ` are the overall stability constants\n*   The sum `Σ` in the denominator runs over all possible complexes (from i=1 to the maximum, N=4).\n*   The '1' term in the denominator represents the free metal ion, `Co²⁺` (where i=0, β₀ is defined as 1).\n\nFor the desired complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Careful Points and Assumptions:**\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. We are given a total ligand concentration `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` and a total metal concentration `c(Co) = 0.01 M`. Because the ligand is in 10-fold excess, the amount that binds to the metal is small relative to the total. Therefore, it is a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Irrelevance of Total Metal Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed to calculate the relative percentage (mole fraction), as it cancels out during the formula's derivation.\n\n**4. The Calculation:**\nUsing the given values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate the denominator, which is the sum of terms for all species:\n*   Term for free Co²⁺ (i=0): **1**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (i=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (i=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × 0.1² = **0.4**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (i=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × 0.1³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (i=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × 0.1⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSum of the denominator terms:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nFinally, calculate the mole fraction `α₂` and the percentage:\n*   `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n*   Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**5. Final Decision:**\nThe calculation robustly yields a result of 16.9%. Matching this to the specific options provided in the question:\nA) 25.6%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is a quantitative analysis problem in coordination chemistry. The goal is to determine the percentage of a specific cobalt complex among all cobalt-containing species. A careful analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the calculation method and the final numerical result, with discrepancies only arising from the lettering of the multiple-choice options. Here is a definitive, step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\n**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This value is the mole fraction of the species, denoted `α₂`, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. State the Governing Chemical Principle and Formula**\nWhen a metal ion (M) and a ligand (L) are in solution, they form a series of complexes in equilibrium. The mole fraction `αₙ` of a specific complex `[MLₙ]` is a function of the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants `βᵢ`. The formula is:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n\nFor the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂` (where n=2):\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. List Careful Points and Justify Assumptions**\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The formula uses the *free* ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total metal concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M), the amount of ligand bound to cobalt is small relative to the total. Therefore, it is a valid and standard chemical approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration. We use `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n*   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not required for calculating the *relative percentage* or mole fraction, as it cancels out during the formula's derivation.\n*   **The '1' in the Denominator:** It is crucial to remember the '1' term in the denominator. It represents the fraction of the metal that remains as the free ion (`Co²⁺`), for which the stability constant β₀ is defined as 1.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nUsing the given values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n*   **Numerator** = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, which is the sum of terms for all species:\n*   Term for `Co²⁺` (free ion): **1**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × 0.1² = **0.4**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × 0.1³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × 0.1⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSumming these terms gives the denominator:\n*   **Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nNow, we can calculate the mole fraction `α₂`:\n*   `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ **0.16916**\n\nFinally, we convert the mole fraction to a percentage:\n*   **Percentage** = `α₂` × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation robustly shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately **16.9%**. This numerical result is agreed upon by all the candidate answers, confirming the correctness of the calculation. We must now match this result to the options provided in the main question:\n\nA) 38.1%\nB) 25.6%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 42.3%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers and a detailed, step-by-step evaluation of the chemistry problem, the following conclusion is reached.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers\nThere is a clear and unanimous consensus among all 15 candidate agents on the methodology and the final numerical result.\n*   **Correct Formula:** All agents correctly identified the formula for the mole fraction (`α₂`) of the target complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n*   **Correct Calculation:** All agents correctly substituted the given values and performed the calculation.\n*   **Unanimous Numerical Result:** Every single agent arrived at the same numerical result of approximately **16.9%**.\n*   **Source of Discrepancy:** The only difference between the answers is the letter (A, B, C, or D) chosen. This is because the options were presented in a different order to each agent, leading to a clerical error in the final selection rather than a scientific one.\n\nGiven the complete agreement on the calculation, the task is to verify the calculation and match the correct result to the options as presented in the problem statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction (`α₂`) and multiplying by 100.\n\n2.  **State the Governing Formula:** The mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in a system with various complexes is calculated using the overall stability constants (`β`) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`. The formula is:\n    `αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n    where the sum in the denominator goes from i=1 to the maximum coordination number, and the `1` represents the free metal ion (for which β₀ = 1).\n    For our target species, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, the formula is:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:** We use the given values:\n    *   Stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n    *   Thiocyanate concentration: `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M (This approximation is valid as the total ligand concentration of 0.1 M is in 10-fold excess over the total metal concentration of 10⁻² M).\n\n    *   **Calculate the Numerator:** This is the term for our target complex.\n        `Numerator = β₂ × [SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    *   **Calculate the Denominator:** This is the sum of terms for all possible cobalt species.\n        `Denominator = 1 (for Co²⁺) + (β₁×0.1¹) + (β₂×0.1²) + (β₃×0.1³) + (β₄×0.1⁴)`\n        `Denominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)`\n        `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n        `Denominator = 2.3646`\n\n    *   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (`α₂`):**\n        `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n    *   **Convert to Percentage:**\n        `Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\nThe calculated percentage is approximately **16.9%**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   It is crucial to use the correct formula for mole fraction, remembering to include the term `1` in the denominator for the free metal ion.\n*   The assumption that the free ligand concentration equals the total ligand concentration is valid because the ligand is in large excess but is important to acknowledge.\n*   The total metal concentration `c(Co)` is not used directly in the mole fraction calculation but is essential for justifying the ligand concentration assumption.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe calculation definitively shows the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex to be **16.9%**. Matching this correct numerical result with the specific list of options provided in the question:\n\nA) 42.3%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step verification of the problem, here is a detailed breakdown of the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal of the Question**\nThe objective is to determine the relative abundance of a specific chemical species, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, in a solution. The question asks for this abundance to be expressed as a percentage of all cobalt-containing species. This is a classic problem in equilibrium and coordination chemistry.\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Scientific Principle and Formula**\nWhen a metal ion (M) and a ligand (L) are in solution, they form a series of complexes `[ML]`, `[ML₂]`, etc., in equilibrium. The mole fraction, `αₙ`, of a specific complex `[MLₙ]` is given by the formula:\n\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `αₙ` is the mole fraction of the complex with 'n' ligands.\n*   `βₙ` is the overall stability constant for the formation of `[MLₙ]` from M and L.\n*   `[L]` is the concentration of the *free* (unbound) ligand at equilibrium.\n*   The sum `Σ` in the denominator runs over all possible complexes (from i=1 to the maximum coordination number, in this case 4).\n*   The `1` in the denominator represents the free metal ion, M (for which `β₀` is defined as 1).\n\nFor our target complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂`:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Evaluate the Data and State Assumptions (Careful Points)**\n*   **Ligand Concentration `[SCN⁻]`**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration. The problem gives a *total* thiocyanate concentration of 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M (0.01 M). Since the ligand is in a 10-fold excess compared to the metal, the amount of thiocyanate that gets bound into complexes is small relative to its total concentration. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration.\n    *   **Assumption:** `[SCN⁻] ≈ [SCN⁻]total = 0.1 M`. All candidate answers correctly made this assumption.\n*   **Total Metal Concentration `c(Co)`**: The value `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not directly needed for the calculation of the relative percentage (mole fraction). Its main purpose is to justify the assumption about the ligand concentration above.\n*   **Stability Constants**: The values `β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, and `β₄=16` are used directly in the formula.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nWe substitute the known values into the formula for `α₂`.\n\n*   **Calculate the Numerator** (the term for our species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`):\n    Numerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Calculate the Denominator** (the sum of terms for all cobalt species):\n    *   Term for free Co²⁺: **1**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × (0.1)¹ = **0.9**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\n    Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (`α₂`)**:\n    `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage**:\n    Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\nThe calculation robustly yields a value of **16.9%**. A review of all candidate answers shows they all reached this same numerical conclusion, confirming the correctness of the method.
