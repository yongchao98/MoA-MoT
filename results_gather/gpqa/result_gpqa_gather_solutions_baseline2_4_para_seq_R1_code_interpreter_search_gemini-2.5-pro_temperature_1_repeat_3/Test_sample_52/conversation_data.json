The chemical fragment for this core is **C₆H₄**.\n    *   The ¹H NMR data showing \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" is fully consistent with the four hydrogen atoms remaining on this C₆H₄ core.\n    *   This fragment contributes **6 Carbon atoms** and **4 Hydrogen atoms** to the final formula.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Functional Groups:**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an **ester group (-COO-)**. This accounts for the **2 Oxygen atoms** found in all the provided formula options.\n\n3.  **Decode the Substituents Using ¹H NMR:** The NMR data provides the most decisive clues.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group.** The signal described as \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\" is a highly specific and unambiguous fingerprint. This splitting pattern identifies a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)** as one of the substituents. The vinyl proton next to the methyl group is split by its single vinyl neighbor (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (giving a quartet), resulting in the \"doublet of quartets\" signal. The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, appearing as a simple \"doublet\". This fragment contributes **3 Carbon atoms** and **5 Hydrogen atoms** (`C₃H₅`) and also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The \"No -CH₂-\" Rule.** A critical piece of negative evidence is that there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** This definitively rules out common structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`) or any other group containing a methylene (`-CH₂-`) bridge.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: The Second Methyl Group.** The spectrum shows a second, distinct signal for a `–CH₃` group. Based on the \"no -CH₂-\" rule and the presence of an ester, this second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, for example, as a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). This second substituent fragment contributes **2 Carbon atoms**, **3 Hydrogen atoms**, and the **2 Oxygen atoms**. The formula for this fragment is `C₂H₃O₂`.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Final Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from all the identified pieces, we can calculate the complete molecular formula:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring Fragment:** C₆H₄\n    *   **Propenyl Group Fragment:** C₃H₅\n    *   **Ester/Methyl Fragment:** C₂H₃O₂\n    *   **Sum of Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Sum of Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Sum of Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\n    The deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verify and Select the Final Answer:**\n    The result can be cross-checked using the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE). The formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ has a DBE of 6 (calculated as 11 - 12/2 + 1). The deduced structure also has a DBE of 6 (4 for the ring, 1 for the vinyl C=C, and 1 for the ester C=O). The perfect match confirms the result.\n    Comparing the deduced formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, to the options:\n    A) C12H12O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C11H12O2\n    D) C11H14O2\n\n    The only matching option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deconstruction of spectroscopic data to determine the molecular formula of an unknown compound. The reasoning of all candidate answers is uniformly correct in identifying the molecular fragments and calculating the formula, differing only in the final letter choice due to variations in the provided option lists.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Core Molecular Structure (Aromatic Ring)**\n\n*   **Information**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" and the ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n*   **Deduction**: A benzene ring (C₆H₆) with two substituents becomes a **C₆H₄** fragment. The presence of two signals for the four remaining hydrogens is consistent with this di-substituted structure (e.g., in a para or ortho arrangement).\n*   **Contribution**: 6 Carbon atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms.\n\n**2. Analyze the Functional Groups (Ester)**\n\n*   **Information**: The FTIR spectrum indicates an \"ester group.\"\n*   **Deduction**: This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. This accounts for the **2 Oxygen atoms** present in all the options. It also represents one degree of unsaturation (C=O).\n*   **Contribution**: 2 Oxygen atoms, 1 Carbonyl Carbon.\n\n**3. Analyze the Substituents using ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThis is the most critical stage, where specific fragments are identified.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group Signature.** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This is a highly characteristic splitting pattern that unambiguously identifies a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**.\n    *   The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in the \"doublet of quartets\" signal.\n    *   The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a simple \"doublet.\"\n    *   This fragment's formula is **C₃H₅**. It accounts for 3 carbons, 5 hydrogens, and one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   **Contribution**: 3 Carbon atoms, 5 Hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Second Methyl Group and Negative Evidence.** The spectrum shows a second, distinct signal for a `-CH₃` group. Critically, there are \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n    *   This negative evidence is key. It rules out the presence of longer alkyl chains like an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n    *   Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming either a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`).\n    *   This fragment contributes the ester's carbonyl carbon, the second methyl group's carbon, and three hydrogens.\n    *   **Contribution**: 2 Carbon atoms (1 from C=O, 1 from -CH₃), 3 Hydrogen atoms.\n\n**4. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Final Formula**\n\nWe now sum the atomic contributions from all identified fragments:\n*   **Aromatic Ring**: C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group**: C₃H₅\n*   **Ester/Methyl Fragment**: C₂H₃O₂\n\n**Total Calculation**:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: **2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**5. Verification using Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   **DBE from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) **: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n*   **DBE from Structure**: 1 aromatic ring (4 DBEs) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DBE) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DBE) = **6**.\nThe values match perfectly, confirming the consistency of the deduction.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe molecular formula derived from a thorough analysis of all spectroscopic data is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe calculated formula matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn analysis of the fifteen candidate answers reveals a strong and unanimous consensus on the chemical reasoning and the final molecular formula. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to different orderings of the options presented to each agent, but their deduction of the chemical formula itself is consistently **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. The following is a step-by-step synthesis of their correct and universally applied logic.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identifying the Aromatic Core Fragment (C₆H₄)**\n\n*   **Information:** The problem states the compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" and the ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n*   **Deduction:** A benzene ring (C₆H₆) with two substituents becomes a **C₆H₄** fragment. The four protons remaining on this ring give two distinct signals, which is consistent with this structure.\n*   **Atom Count:** This fragment contributes **6 Carbons** and **4 Hydrogens**.\n\n**2. Identifying the Substituent Fragments from FTIR and ¹H NMR**\n\nThis step relies on interpreting specific signals and, just as importantly, noting the absence of others.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group (C₃H₅).**\n    *   **Information:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This specific and complex splitting pattern is a definitive fingerprint for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by its other vinyl neighbor (creating a doublet) and by the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, creating a \"doublet\". This fragment contributes **3 Carbons** and **5 Hydrogens**, and it also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Methyl Ester Fragment (C₂H₃O₂).**\n    *   **Information:** FTIR confirms an ester group. The ¹H NMR confirms a second `-CH₃` group but explicitly shows **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"**.\n    *   **Deduction:** The ester group accounts for the **2 Oxygen atoms**. The second `-CH₃` must be part of this ester. The \"no -CH₂-\" rule is a critical piece of negative evidence that eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). The only way to construct the substituent is to attach the methyl group directly to the ester, forming a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or acetoxy (`-O-CO-CH₃`) fragment. Both of these contribute one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, and three hydrogens.\n    *   **Atom Count:** This fragment contributes **2 Carbons**, **3 Hydrogens**, and **2 Oxygens**.\n\n**3. Assembling the Molecular Formula**\n\nBy summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we arrive at the total molecular formula:\n*   **Fragment 1 (Ring):** C₆H₄\n*   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl):** C₃H₅\n*   **Fragment 3 (Ester):** C₂H₃O₂\n\n**Total Calculation:**\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**4. Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nThis final check confirms the consistency of the conclusion.\n*   **DBE from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n*   **DBE from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DBEs) + 1 vinyl C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 ester C=O double bond (1 DBE) = **6**.\nThe perfect match validates the analysis. The derived formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` is the only one consistent with all spectroscopic evidence. Matching this result to the question's original list of options:\n\nA) C12H12O2\nB) C11H14O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nThe correct formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the provided information and the unanimous reasoning of the candidate answers, the chemical formula can be determined through a systematic step-by-step process.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Structure:**\n    *   **Information:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This identifies a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. This core fragment has the formula **C₆H₄**. It accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The fact that the four protons on this ring give only two signals suggests a symmetric substitution pattern (e.g., para). This detail reinforces the structure but isn't strictly necessary for the final formula calculation.\n\n2.  **Identify Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Information:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an \"ester group\" (`-COO-`).\n    *   **Deduction:** This immediately accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the final formula.\n\n3.  **Elucidate the Substituents Using ¹H NMR (The most critical steps):**\n    *   **Information:** \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\".\n    *   **Deduction:** This highly specific splitting pattern is a definitive signature of a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Decoding the Splitting):** The \"doublet of quartets\" arises from a vinyl proton that is split by its neighboring vinyl proton (giving the doublet) *and* by the three protons of an adjacent methyl group (giving the quartet). The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, resulting in a simple \"doublet\". This unambiguous pattern is key to identifying this C₃H₅ fragment. This fragment also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   **Information:** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" but **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n    *   **Deduction:** One methyl group has been assigned to the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must belong to the ester functionality.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (The Importance of Negative Evidence):** The absence of `-CH₂-` signals is a crucial constraint. It rules out common structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, as in a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy (`-OCOCH₃`) group. This second fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Final Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from all the identified pieces, we determine the complete molecular formula:\n    *   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C₆H₄\n    *   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C₃H₅\n    *   **Fragment 3 (Ester/Methyl Group):** C₂H₃O₂\n\n    Summing the atoms gives:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n    The final deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verification and Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Consistency Check):** The formula can be verified using the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE). DBE for C₁₁H₁₂O₂ = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This perfectly matches the DBE from the structure: 1 aromatic ring (4), 1 vinyl C=C double bond (1), and 1 ester C=O double bond (1), for a total of 6. The consistency confirms the deduction is sound.\n    *   Comparing the derived formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` to the provided options:\n        A) C11H14O2\n        B) C12H12O2\n        C) C12H14O2\n        D) C11H12O2\n    *   The correct formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nTo determine the final answer, a comprehensive analysis of the spectroscopic evidence is required. The reasoning across all candidate agents is remarkably consistent, highlighting a clear and correct logical pathway to the solution. The discrepancies in the final letter choices stem from variations in the option lists provided to each agent, but their deduction of the chemical formula itself is unanimous.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nHere is a consolidated analysis, breaking down the problem into identifiable fragments based on the data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Core:**\n    *   **Information:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This establishes the presence of a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced.

The crucial piece of negative evidence—the absence of `–CH₂` signals—rules out structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, forming a fragment like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`).

This analysis consolidates the correct and consistent reasoning found across all candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of this problem is to deduce the molecular formula by identifying the distinct structural fragments of the unknown compound using the given spectroscopic clues.\n\n**1. Identify the Molecular Core: The Aromatic Ring**\n*   **Information:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" and the ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n*   **Deduction:** A benzene ring (C₆H₆) that is di-substituted has had two hydrogen atoms replaced, leaving a fragment with the formula **C₆H₄**.

Identify the Substituents using ¹H NMR Data**\nThis step uses the most specific and conclusive information.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**\n    *   **Information:** \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This unique splitting pattern is a definitive signature for a **propenyl group**. The vinyl proton closer to the ring is split only by its vinyl neighbor (a doublet). The other vinyl proton is split by its vinyl neighbor (a doublet) AND the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\". This fragment accounts for one of the two `-CH₃` groups.\n    *   **Atom Count from this Fragment:** 3 carbons, 5 hydrogens.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Ester/Methyl Group and the \"No -CH₂-\" Rule**\n    *   **Information:** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" and, crucially, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** One methyl group is in the propenyl substituent. The second methyl group must belong to the ester substituent. The \"no -CH₂-\" rule is a key piece of negative evidence that eliminates longer alkyl chains like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or acetoxy (`-OCOCH₃`) group.\n    *   **Atom Count from this Fragment:** 2 carbons (one from the C=O, one from the `-CH₃`), 3 hydrogens, and the 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n**4.

By breaking down the molecule into identifiable fragments based on each piece of evidence, we can assemble the complete formula. The following step-by-step reasoning incorporates all the careful points necessary for an accurate deduction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Core (Aromatic Ring):**\n    *   **Information:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This establishes the core structure as a benzene ring (C₆H₆) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. This core fragment has the formula **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **Careful Point (NMR Confirmation):** The ¹H NMR data shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which is consistent with the four protons remaining on the C₆H₄ ring. This fragment contributes **6 carbon** atoms and **4 hydrogen** atoms.\n\n2.  **Identify the First Substituent (Propenyl Group):**\n    *   **Information:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This highly specific splitting pattern is a definitive signature for a **propenyl group (`–CH=CH–CH₃`)**.\n    *   **Careful Point (Splitting Pattern):** The \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) signal arises from the vinyl proton next to the methyl group. It is split into a doublet by its adjacent vinyl proton neighbor, and each of those lines is further split into a quartet by the three protons of the methyl group. The other vinyl proton is only coupled to its neighbor, so it appears as a simple \"doublet\" (d). This fragment accounts for one of the two `–CH₃` signals mentioned.\n    *   This fragment contributes **3 carbon** atoms and **5 hydrogen** atoms (`C₃H₅`).\n\n3.  **Identify the Second Substituent (Ester/Methyl Group):**\n    *   **Information:** The FTIR shows an \"ester group.\" The ¹H NMR shows a second `–CH₃` signal and, critically, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** The ester group (`–COO–`) accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms**. The second methyl group must be part of this substituent.\n    *   **Careful Point (Negative Evidence):** The absence of `–CH₂` signals is a crucial constraint. It rules out common structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`).

Both of these possible fragments contribute the same number of atoms.\n    *   This fragment contributes **2 carbon** atoms (one carbonyl carbon and one methyl carbon), **3 hydrogen** atoms, and the **2 oxygen** atoms.

For C₁₁H₁₂O₂, the DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**.

The logic, which is consistently applied across all candidate answers, involves breaking the molecule down into its constituent fragments and then summing their atomic compositions.\n\n**1. Identifying the Molecular Core**\n*   **Information:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms this with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n*   **Deduction:** A benzene ring (C₆H₆) that is di-substituted has two hydrogens replaced. The remaining core fragment is therefore **C₆H₄**. The four hydrogens on this ring produce two NMR signals, which is consistent with a symmetric substitution pattern.\n*   **Contribution:** 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n\n**2. Identifying Functional Groups and a Key Substituent**\n*   **Information:** The FTIR spectrum indicates an \"ester group.\" The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n*   **Deduction:**\n    *   The ester group (–COO–) accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the final formula.\n    *   The vinyl proton splitting pattern is a definitive and unambiguous signature. A \"doublet of quartets\" arises when a proton is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and a methyl group (giving the quartet). This unequivocally identifies a **propenyl group (`–CH=CH–CH₃`)** as one of the substituents.\n*   **Contribution:** The propenyl group contributes **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens**. It also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals mentioned in the data.\n\n**3. Identifying the Second Substituent and Applying Negative Evidence**\n*   **Information:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" and, critically, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n*   **Deduction:**\n    *   One methyl group belongs to the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the second substituent, which also contains the ester group.\n    *   The \"no –CH₂ groups\" rule is a crucial constraint. It eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality. This results in a fragment such as a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`).\n*   **Contribution:** Both possible fragments contribute the same atoms to the formula: **2 carbons** (one carbonyl, one methyl), **3 hydrogens**, and the **2 oxygen atoms**.\n\n**4. Assembling the Full Molecular Formula**\nBy summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we arrive at the total molecular formula:\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (aromatic ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl group) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester/methyl fragment)\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**5.

The process involves breaking down the molecule into identifiable fragments and then summing their atomic compositions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nHere is a consolidated breakdown of the steps and careful points required to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Core Fragment (C₆H₄)**\n    *   **Data:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" and the ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This combination of data identifies a benzene ring with two substituents. The fragment itself has the formula C₆H₄, accounting for the four protons on the ring.\n    *   **Contribution:** 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n\n2.  **Identify Functional Groups (O₂ and Ester)**\n    *   **Data:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an \"ester group.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This immediately accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the final formula and the presence of a carbonyl (C=O) group, which represents one degree of unsaturation.\n\n3.  **Elucidate the Substituents using ¹H NMR Data**\n    This is the most critical part of the analysis and relies on several pieces of evidence.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`).** The ¹H NMR signal for the vinyl protons is described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets.\" This is a classic and definitive spectroscopic signature that unambiguously identifies a **propenyl group**.\n        *   The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in the \"doublet of quartets\".\n        *   The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a \"doublet\".\n        *   This substituent fragment contributes **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens** (C₃H₅) and accounts for one of the two `-CH₃` signals.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Second Methyl Group and \"No -CH₂-\" Rule.** The data states there are \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" and, crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n        *   Having already assigned one methyl group to the propenyl substituent, the second methyl must be part of the ester group.\n        *   The \"no -CH₂-\" rule is a key piece of negative evidence. It rules out common possibilities like an ethyl ester (which contains a -CH₂- group).\n        *   Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming a structure such as a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`). This fragment contributes the ester's carbonyl carbon, the second methyl group's carbon, and the associated hydrogens.\n        *   This ester-containing fragment contributes **2 carbons**, **3 hydrogens**, and the **2 oxygen atoms** (C₂H₃O₂).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Full Molecular Formula**\n    By summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we can calculate the final molecular formula:\n    *   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (aromatic ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl group) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester/methyl part)\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n    *   The deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Final Verification and Answer Selection**\n    *   **Hydrogen Count:** The individual proton counts from the NMR signals confirm the hydrogen total: 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (propenyl methyl) + 3 (ester methyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The DBE for C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is 6, which perfectly matches the structure (1 aromatic ring = 4, 1 vinyl C=C = 1, 1 ester C=O = 1).\n    *   **Matching with Options:** Comparing the derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, with the provided options:\n        A) C12H12O2\n        B) C11H12O2\n        C) C11H14O2\n        D) C12H14O2\n\nThe correct formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous and logically sound method for deducing the chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data. The slight variations in the final letter choices are due to differences in the option order provided to each agent, but their chemical reasoning consistently arrives at the same formula.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis incorporating the crucial points necessary to solve the problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identifying the Core Structure (Aromatic Ring)**\n*   **Information:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR confirms this with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n*   **Deduction:** A benzene ring (C₆H₆) with two substituents becomes a **C₆H₄** fragment. The four protons on this ring are accounted for by the NMR data.\n*   **Careful Point:** This fragment establishes the base of the molecule, contributing **6 carbon** atoms and **4 hydrogen** atoms to the total count.\n\n**2. Identifying the Key Functional Groups**\n*   **Information:** FTIR data shows an \"ester group.\"\n*   **Deduction:** An ester group (`-COO-`) contains **2 oxygen atoms**. This accounts for the `O₂` part of the formula.\n*   **Careful Point:** The ester group also contains a carbonyl (`C=O`) double bond, which will be relevant for verifying the degree of unsaturation later.\n\n**3. Decoding the Substituents Using ¹H NMR**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis, requiring the integration of several pieces of NMR data.\n*   **Information:** Two signals for vinyl protons, described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets.\"\n*   **Deduction:** This very specific splitting pattern is a definitive signature or \"fingerprint\" for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**.\n*   **Careful Point (The Propenyl Group):** The reason this pattern is so specific is the coupling. The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), which combine to form the \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, so it appears as a simple \"doublet\". This fragment contributes **C₃H₅** (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens) and also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n\n*   **Information:** \"Two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" and, crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n*   **Deduction:** We've assigned one methyl group to the propenyl substituent. The second methyl group must belong to the ester substituent.\n*   **Careful Point (The \"No CH₂\" Rule):** This piece of negative evidence is extremely powerful. It eliminates the possibility of structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`), which would show a `–CH₂` signal. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, as in a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** (2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, 2 oxygens) to the total formula.\n\n**4. Assembling the Final Molecular Formula**\nBy summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we can determine the complete formula:\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester fragment)\n*   **Summing Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Summing Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Summing Oxygens (O):** 2\n\nThe final deduced formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**5. Verification and Final Answer Selection**\n*   **Verification:** A check of the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) confirms the result. For `C₁₁H₁₂O₂`, the DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. The proposed structure contains an aromatic ring (4 DBEs), a C=C double bond (1 DBE), and a C=O double bond (1 DBE), for a total of 6 DBEs. The perfect match confirms the analysis.\n*   **Matching with Options:** Comparing the derived formula, `C₁₁H₁₂O₂`, to the original options:\n    A) C12H14O2\n    B) C11H14O2\n    C) C11H12O2\n    D) C12H12O2\n\nThe calculated formula matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo decide the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the chemical evidence from the spectroscopic data is performed. The reasoning provided by the candidate answers is remarkably consistent and logically sound, converging on the same chemical formula despite variations in the multiple-choice lettering.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe process involves identifying molecular fragments from the data and summing their atoms.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring Fragment:**\n    *   **Data:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" and its ¹H NMR spectrum has \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This combination points to a benzene ring core where two hydrogens are replaced.

This pattern arises from a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating the doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating the quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, creating a simple \"doublet\". This fragment accounts for one of the two methyl group signals mentioned.\n        *   **Atoms Accounted For:** 3 carbons, 5 hydrogens (`C₃H₅`).\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Second Methyl Group and Negative Evidence.** The spectrum shows two `-CH₃` signals and, critically, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** Since one methyl group is in the propenyl substituent, the second methyl group must belong to the ester substituent. The \"no -CH₂\" rule is crucial; it eliminates structures with an intervening methylene group, such as an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, as in a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or acetoxy (`-OCOCH₃`) group.

The reasoning provided by the candidate agents is uniformly correct and leads to the same molecular formula, demonstrating a strong consensus on the interpretation of the data. The following step-by-step analysis breaks down the problem, highlighting the most critical points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Structure:**\n    *   **Evidence:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" and the ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This establishes the presence of a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced.

The vinyl proton next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (forming a doublet) and by the three methyl protons (forming a quartet), which combine to create a \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, appearing as a simple \"doublet\". This fragment contributes **C₃H₅** (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens) and accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Second Methyl Group and Negative Evidence.**\n        *   **Evidence:** The spectrum shows a second signal for a `–CH₃` group. Critically, there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n        *   **Deduction:** This negative evidence is key. It rules out longer alkyl chains like an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`). Since one substituent is the propenyl group, the second substituent must contain the ester functionality and the second methyl group. The \"no -CH₂\" rule forces this to be a simple fragment like a **methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`)** or an **acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`)**.

Identify the Molecular Core and Oxygen Content.**\n*   **Information**: The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" and the FTIR spectrum shows an \"ester group.\"\n*   **Reasoning**: A benzene ring (C₆H₆) with two substituents becomes a **C₆H₄** fragment. The ¹H NMR confirms the 4 protons on this ring with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" The ester group (-COO-) accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms**.\n*   **Careful Point 1**: The deduction starts with a solid foundation by identifying the largest fragment, the C₆H₄ core, which contributes 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens to the final formula.

Elucidate the First Substituent.**\n*   **Information**: The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n*   **Reasoning**: This complex splitting pattern is a highly specific and unambiguous signature. It can only correspond to a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group is split by its single vinyl neighbor (the doublet part) and the three protons of the methyl group (the quartet part), yielding the \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, appearing as a simple \"doublet\".\n*   **Careful Point 2**: This is the single most important piece of information. Correctly identifying the propenyl group from its unique NMR fingerprint is the key to solving the structure. This fragment contributes **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n\n**3. Elucidate the Second Substituent.**\n*   **Information**: The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" and \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"\n*   **Reasoning**: We have already accounted for one `-CH₃` group (in the propenyl fragment). The second `-CH₃` must be part of the ester substituent. The explicit absence of `-CH₂-` signals is crucial negative evidence.\n*   **Careful Point 3**: This \"no `-CH₂-` groups\" constraint rules out common ester fragments like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). The second methyl group must therefore be directly attached to the ester, forming a structure such as a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`). Both of these possible fragments contribute **C₂H₃O₂** to the final formula.\n\n**4. Assemble the Molecular Formula.**\n*   **Reasoning**: We sum the atomic compositions of all identified fragments.\n*   **Fragments**: `C₆H₄` (aromatic ring) + `C₃H₅` (propenyl group) + `C₂H₃O₂` (ester/methyl fragment)\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n*   **Careful Point 4**: The final step is a simple summation. The systematically deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**5. Verification and Final Selection.**\n*   The derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, is consistent with all spectroscopic data. The degree of unsaturation is 6 (4 for the ring, 1 for the C=C bond, 1 for the C=O bond), which matches the formula (DBE = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6).\n*   Comparing this correct formula to the options provided in the question:\n    A) C11H12O2\n    B) C11H14O2\n    C) C12H12O2\n    D) C12H14O2\n\nThe deduced formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula, based on the unanimous reasoning found in the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe solution to this problem lies in systematically breaking down the provided spectroscopic information into molecular fragments and then summing their atomic compositions to find the total molecular formula.\n\n**1. Aromatic Ring Fragment Identification**\n*   **Evidence**: The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". The ¹H NMR confirms this with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which accounts for the 4 protons remaining on a di-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Deduction**: The core of the molecule is a C₆H₄ fragment.\n*   **Contribution**: 6 Carbon atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms.\n\n**2. Ester Functional Group and Oxygen Count**\n*   **Evidence**: The FTIR spectrum shows an absorption peak for an \"ester group\".\n*   **Deduction**: The molecule contains a `-COO-` functional group.\n*   **Contribution**: 2 Oxygen atoms.\n\n**3. Substituent Identification using ¹H NMR Data**\nThis step uses the most specific details from the ¹H NMR to identify the two groups attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**\n    *   **Evidence**: The NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\".\n    *   **Deduction**: This is a classic, unambiguous fingerprint pattern for a propenyl group. The vinyl proton next to the methyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`) is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in the characteristic \"doublet of quartets\" signal. The other vinyl proton (`-CH=CH-CH₃`) is only split by its neighbor, resulting in a \"doublet\". This fragment also accounts for one of the two `-CH₃` groups.\n    *   **Contribution**: 3 Carbon atoms, 5 Hydrogen atoms (`C₃H₅`).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Second Methyl Group and the Power of Negative Evidence**\n    *   **Evidence**: The spectrum shows a second `-CH₃` signal, but critically, there are \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**\".\n    *   **Deduction**: Since one `-CH₃` is in the propenyl group, the second one must be part of the ester substituent. The \"no -CH₂\" rule is crucial; it eliminates the possibility of an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`) or other longer chains. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, as in a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy (`-OCOCH₃`) group.\n    *   **Contribution**: This fragment provides the remaining atoms: the carbonyl carbon (`C=O`), the second methyl group (`-CH₃`), and the two oxygens, for a total of 2 Carbon atoms and 3 Hydrogen atoms (`C₂H₃O₂`).\n\n**4. Assembling the Final Molecular Formula**\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n*   **Aromatic Ring**: C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group**: C₃H₅\n*   **Ester/Methyl Group**: C₂H₃O₂\n*   **Total Carbons (C)**: 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H)**: 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O)**: **2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**5. Verification and Final Answer Selection**\nTo confirm, we check the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):\n*   **From Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂)**: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6.\n*   **From Structure**: 1 aromatic ring (4 DBEs) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DBE) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DBE) = 6.\nThe values match, confirming the deduction.\n\nWe now compare the derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, with the options provided in the question:\nA) C12H12O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C11H14O2\n\nThe calculated formula matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

The following is a step-by-step synthesis of their correct and universally applied logic.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identifying the Aromatic Core Fragment (C₆H₄)**\n\n*   **Information:** The problem states the compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" and the ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n*   **Deduction:** A benzene ring (C₆H₆) with two substituents becomes a **C₆H₄** fragment.

Identifying the Substituent Fragments from FTIR and ¹H NMR**\n\nThis step relies on interpreting specific signals and, just as importantly, noting the absence of others.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group (C₃H₅).**\n    *   **Information:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This specific and complex splitting pattern is a definitive fingerprint for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by its other vinyl neighbor (creating a doublet) and by the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, creating a \"doublet\". This fragment contributes **3 Carbons** and **5 Hydrogens**, and it also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Methyl Ester Fragment (C₂H₃O₂).**\n    *   **Information:** FTIR confirms an ester group. The ¹H NMR confirms a second `-CH₃` group but explicitly shows **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"**.\n    *   **Deduction:** The ester group accounts for the **2 Oxygen atoms**. The second `-CH₃` must be part of this ester. The \"no -CH₂-\" rule is a critical piece of negative evidence that eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). The only way to construct the substituent is to attach the methyl group directly to the ester, forming a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or acetoxy (`-O-CO-CH₃`) fragment.

Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nThis final check confirms the consistency of the conclusion.\n*   **DBE from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n*   **DBE from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DBEs) + 1 vinyl C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 ester C=O double bond (1 DBE) = **6**.\nThe perfect match validates the analysis.

This core fragment has the formula **C₆H₄**. It accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The fact that the four protons on this ring give only two signals suggests a symmetric substitution pattern (e.g., para). This detail reinforces the structure but isn't strictly necessary for the final formula calculation.\n\n2.  **Identify Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Information:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an \"ester group\" (`-COO-`).\n    *   **Deduction:** This immediately accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the final formula.\n\n3.  **Elucidate the Substituents Using ¹H NMR (The most critical steps):**\n    *   **Information:** \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\".\n    *   **Deduction:** This highly specific splitting pattern is a definitive signature of a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Decoding the Splitting):** The \"doublet of quartets\" arises from a vinyl proton that is split by its neighboring vinyl proton (giving the doublet) *and* by the three protons of an adjacent methyl group (giving the quartet). The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, resulting in a simple \"doublet\". This unambiguous pattern is key to identifying this C₃H₅ fragment. This fragment also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   **Information:** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" but **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n    *   **Deduction:** One methyl group has been assigned to the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must belong to the ester functionality.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (The Importance of Negative Evidence):** The absence of `-CH₂-` signals is a crucial constraint. It rules out common structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, as in a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy (`-OCOCH₃`) group.

The reasoning across all candidate agents is remarkably consistent, highlighting a clear and correct logical pathway to the solution. The discrepancies in the final letter choices stem from variations in the option lists provided to each agent, but their deduction of the chemical formula itself is unanimous.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nHere is a consolidated analysis, breaking down the problem into identifiable fragments based on the data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Core:**\n    *   **Information:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This establishes the presence of a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced. The formula for this core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **Atoms Accounted For:** 6 carbons, 4 hydrogens.\n\n2.  **Identify Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Information (FTIR):** An \"ester group\" is present.\n    *   **Deduction:** This confirms the molecule contains a `-COO-` functional group, which accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the final formula.\n\n3.  **Elucidate the Substituents (the Key Clues):**\n    *   **Information (¹H NMR):** \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\".\n    *   **Careful Point (Vinyl Group):** This highly specific splitting pattern is an unambiguous fingerprint for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, creating a \"doublet\". This fragment contributes **C₃H₅** (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens) and also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   **Information (¹H NMR):** \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" and \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"\n    *   **Careful Point (Second Substituent):** Having accounted for one `–CH₃` in the propenyl group, the second `–CH₃` must belong to the ester substituent. The crucial piece of negative evidence—the absence of `–CH₂` signals—rules out structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, forming a fragment like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** (2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, 2 oxygens).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Final Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from all the identified pieces, we determine the total formula:\n    *   **Fragment 1 (Ring):** C₆H₄\n    *   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl):** C₃H₅\n    *   **Fragment 3 (Ester/Methyl):** C₂H₃O₂\n    *   **Total Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygen (O):** 2\n    *   The logically deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verification and Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   To verify, the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` is calculated: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This perfectly matches the DBE from the proposed structure: 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (C=C bond) + 1 (C=O bond) = 6.\n    *   The deduced formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` must now be matched against the specific options provided in the question:\n        A) C11H14O2\n        B) C11H12O2\n        C) C12H12O2\n        D) C12H14O2\n    *   The correct formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data. This analysis consolidates the correct and consistent reasoning found across all candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of this problem is to deduce the molecular formula by identifying the distinct structural fragments of the unknown compound using the given spectroscopic clues.\n\n**1. Identify the Molecular Core: The Aromatic Ring**\n*   **Information:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" and the ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n*   **Deduction:** A benzene ring (C₆H₆) that is di-substituted has had two hydrogen atoms replaced, leaving a fragment with the formula **C₆H₄**. The four remaining hydrogens on the ring giving two distinct signals is fully consistent with this structure.\n*   **Atom Count from this Fragment:** 6 carbons, 4 hydrogens.\n\n**2. Identify the Functional Groups**\n*   **Information (FTIR):** The spectrum shows the presence of an **ester group** (`-COO-`).\n*   **Deduction:** This confirms the molecule contains **2 oxygen atoms** and a C=O double bond.\n\n**3. Identify the Substituents using ¹H NMR Data**\nThis step uses the most specific and conclusive information.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**\n    *   **Information:** \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This unique splitting pattern is a definitive signature for a **propenyl group**. The vinyl proton closer to the ring is split only by its vinyl neighbor (a doublet). The other vinyl proton is split by its vinyl neighbor (a doublet) AND the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\". This fragment accounts for one of the two `-CH₃` groups.\n    *   **Atom Count from this Fragment:** 3 carbons, 5 hydrogens.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Ester/Methyl Group and the \"No -CH₂-\" Rule**\n    *   **Information:** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" and, crucially, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** One methyl group is in the propenyl substituent. The second methyl group must belong to the ester substituent. The \"no -CH₂-\" rule is a key piece of negative evidence that eliminates longer alkyl chains like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or acetoxy (`-OCOCH₃`) group.\n    *   **Atom Count from this Fragment:** 2 carbons (one from the C=O, one from the `-CH₃`), 3 hydrogens, and the 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n**4. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Final Formula**\nWe now sum the atoms from all the identified parts:\n*   **Fragment 1 (Ring):** C₆H₄\n*   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl):** C₃H₅\n*   **Fragment 3 (Ester/Methyl):** C₂H₃O₂\n\n**Total Calculation:**\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**5.

By breaking down the molecule into identifiable fragments based on each piece of evidence, we can assemble the complete formula. The following step-by-step reasoning incorporates all the careful points necessary for an accurate deduction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Core (Aromatic Ring):**\n    *   **Information:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This establishes the core structure as a benzene ring (C₆H₆) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. This core fragment has the formula **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **Careful Point (NMR Confirmation):** The ¹H NMR data shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which is consistent with the four protons remaining on the C₆H₄ ring. This fragment contributes **6 carbon** atoms and **4 hydrogen** atoms.\n\n2.  **Identify the First Substituent (Propenyl Group):**\n    *   **Information:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This highly specific splitting pattern is a definitive signature for a **propenyl group (`–CH=CH–CH₃`)**.\n    *   **Careful Point (Splitting Pattern):** The \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) signal arises from the vinyl proton next to the methyl group. It is split into a doublet by its adjacent vinyl proton neighbor, and each of those lines is further split into a quartet by the three protons of the methyl group. The other vinyl proton is only coupled to its neighbor, so it appears as a simple \"doublet\" (d). This fragment accounts for one of the two `–CH₃` signals mentioned.\n    *   This fragment contributes **3 carbon** atoms and **5 hydrogen** atoms (`C₃H₅`).\n\n3.  **Identify the Second Substituent (Ester/Methyl Group):**\n    *   **Information:** The FTIR shows an \"ester group.\" The ¹H NMR shows a second `–CH₃` signal and, critically, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** The ester group (`–COO–`) accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms**. The second methyl group must be part of this substituent.\n    *   **Careful Point (Negative Evidence):** The absence of `–CH₂` signals is a crucial constraint. It rules out common structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, for example as a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`). Both of these possible fragments contribute the same number of atoms.\n    *   This fragment contributes **2 carbon** atoms (one carbonyl carbon and one methyl carbon), **3 hydrogen** atoms, and the **2 oxygen** atoms. The formula is `C₂H₃O₂`.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we can calculate the complete formula:\n    *   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester)\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n    *   The final, deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verification and Matching with Options:**\n    *   We can verify the result with the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE). For C₁₁H₁₂O₂, the DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**.

The logic, which is consistently applied across all candidate answers, involves breaking the molecule down into its constituent fragments and then summing their atomic compositions.\n\n**1. Identifying the Molecular Core**\n*   **Information:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms this with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n*   **Deduction:** A benzene ring (C₆H₆) that is di-substituted has two hydrogens replaced. The remaining core fragment is therefore **C₆H₄**. The four hydrogens on this ring produce two NMR signals, which is consistent with a symmetric substitution pattern.\n*   **Contribution:** 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n\n**2. Identifying Functional Groups and a Key Substituent**\n*   **Information:** The FTIR spectrum indicates an \"ester group.\" The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n*   **Deduction:**\n    *   The ester group (–COO–) accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the final formula.\n    *   The vinyl proton splitting pattern is a definitive and unambiguous signature. A \"doublet of quartets\" arises when a proton is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and a methyl group (giving the quartet). This unequivocally identifies a **propenyl group (`–CH=CH–CH₃`)** as one of the substituents.\n*   **Contribution:** The propenyl group contributes **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens**. It also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals mentioned in the data.\n\n**3. Identifying the Second Substituent and Applying Negative Evidence**\n*   **Information:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" and, critically, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n*   **Deduction:**\n    *   One methyl group belongs to the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the second substituent, which also contains the ester group.\n    *   The \"no –CH₂ groups\" rule is a crucial constraint. It eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality. This results in a fragment such as a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`).\n*   **Contribution:** Both possible fragments contribute the same atoms to the formula: **2 carbons** (one carbonyl, one methyl), **3 hydrogens**, and the **2 oxygen atoms**.\n\n**4. Assembling the Full Molecular Formula**\nBy summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we arrive at the total molecular formula:\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (aromatic ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl group) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester/methyl fragment)\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**5.

The slight variations in the final letter choices are due to differences in the option order provided to each agent, but their chemical reasoning consistently arrives at the same formula.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis incorporating the crucial points necessary to solve the problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identifying the Core Structure (Aromatic Ring)**\n*   **Information:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR confirms this with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n*   **Deduction:** A benzene ring (C₆H₆) with two substituents becomes a **C₆H₄** fragment.

Identifying the Key Functional Groups**\n*   **Information:** FTIR data shows an \"ester group.\"\n*   **Deduction:** An ester group (`-COO-`) contains **2 oxygen atoms**. This accounts for the `O₂` part of the formula.\n*   **Careful Point:** The ester group also contains a carbonyl (`C=O`) double bond, which will be relevant for verifying the degree of unsaturation later.\n\n**3. Decoding the Substituents Using ¹H NMR**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis, requiring the integration of several pieces of NMR data.\n*   **Information:** Two signals for vinyl protons, described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets.\"\n*   **Deduction:** This very specific splitting pattern is a definitive signature or \"fingerprint\" for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**.\n*   **Careful Point (The Propenyl Group):** The reason this pattern is so specific is the coupling. The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), which combine to form the \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, so it appears as a simple \"doublet\". This fragment contributes **C₃H₅** (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens) and also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n\n*   **Information:** \"Two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" and, crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n*   **Deduction:** We've assigned one methyl group to the propenyl substituent. The second methyl group must belong to the ester substituent.\n*   **Careful Point (The \"No CH₂\" Rule):** This piece of negative evidence is extremely powerful. It eliminates the possibility of structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`), which would show a `–CH₂` signal. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, as in a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** (2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, 2 oxygens) to the total formula.\n\n**4.

The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating the doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating the quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, creating a simple \"doublet\". This fragment accounts for one of the two methyl group signals mentioned.\n        *   **Atoms Accounted For:** 3 carbons, 5 hydrogens (`C₃H₅`).\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Second Methyl Group and Negative Evidence.** The spectrum shows two `-CH₃` signals and, critically, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** Since one methyl group is in the propenyl substituent, the second methyl group must belong to the ester substituent. The \"no -CH₂\" rule is crucial; it eliminates structures with an intervening methylene group, such as an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, as in a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or acetoxy (`-OCOCH₃`) group. This fragment contributes the ester's carbonyl carbon, the second methyl group, and the two oxygens.\n        *   **Atoms Accounted For:** 2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens (`C₂H₃O₂`).\n\n4.  **Assembling the Final Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the complete formula:\n    *   **Fragments:** `C₆H₄` (ring) + `C₃H₅` (propenyl) + `C₂H₃O₂` (ester/methyl part)\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n    The deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verification and Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The derived formula is fully consistent with all pieces of spectroscopic data. As a final check, the degree of unsaturation (DBE) for `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` is `11 - (12/2) + 1 = 6`. This matches the structural elements perfectly: 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = 6.\n    *   Comparing the calculated formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, with the options provided in the question:\n        *   A) C11H14O2\n        *   B) C12H14O2\n        *   C) C12H12O2\n        *   D) C11H12O2\n    *   The formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo decide the final answer, a comprehensive analysis of the reasoning is required. The consensus among the provided candidate answers is exceptionally strong, and their logic is sound. Here is a step-by-step analysis incorporating all the careful points necessary to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments:** The core of this problem is to translate each piece of spectral information into a corresponding piece of the molecule.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Ring (`C₆H₄`):** The description \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" combined with the ¹H NMR data showing \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" identifies a C₆H₄ fragment. This accounts for **6 carbons** and **4 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Ester Group (`-COO-`):** The FTIR data confirms the presence of an ester functional group. This accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the formula and introduces one degree of unsaturation (the C=O bond).\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group (`C₃H₅`).** The ¹H NMR data showing \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\" is a highly specific fingerprint. This pattern is a definitive signature of a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (causing a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (causing a quartet), resulting in the \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, resulting in a \"doublet\". This fragment contributes **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens** and accounts for one of the two `-CH₃` groups.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Second Methyl Group and Negative Evidence.** The problem states there are two `-CH₃` signals and, critically, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\" One methyl is in the propenyl group. The second must be part of the ester substituent. The \"no -CH₂-\" rule is a crucial constraint that eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). This forces the second methyl group to be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming either a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy (`-OCOCH₃`) group. Either way, this fragment contributes **2 carbons**, **3 hydrogens**, and the **2 oxygens** of the ester.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:** By summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we can determine the complete molecular formula.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** `C₆H₄`\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** `C₃H₅`\n    *   **Ester/Methyl Fragment:** `C₂H₃O₂`\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\n    The deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify the Formula:**\n\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE).** This step confirms the consistency of the conclusion.\n    *   DBE from formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂): DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   DBE from structure: 1 aromatic ring (4 DBEs) + 1 vinyl C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 ester C=O double bond (1 DBE) = **6**.\n    *   The perfect match in DBE values validates the deduced formula.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:** The analysis consistently and unambiguously points to the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. Now, we match this result to the provided options.\n\n    *   A) C12H12O2\n    *   B) C11H12O2\n    *   C) C12H14O2\n    *   D) C11H14O2\n\nThe calculated formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nA comprehensive analysis of the spectroscopic data allows for the systematic determination of the chemical formula. The reasoning provided by the candidate agents is uniformly correct and leads to the same molecular formula, demonstrating a strong consensus on the interpretation of the data. The following step-by-step analysis breaks down the problem, highlighting the most critical points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Structure:**\n    *   **Evidence:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" and the ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This establishes the presence of a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced. The formula for this core fragment is **C₆H₄**. This accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n\n2.  **Identify Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Evidence:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an **ester group** (`-COO-`).\n    *   **Deduction:** This accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the final formula and one degree of unsaturation (the C=O bond).\n\n3.  **Elucidate the Substituents from ¹H NMR Data:** This is the most crucial part of the analysis, where specific signal patterns reveal the exact structure of the attached groups.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group.**\n        *   **Evidence:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n        *   **Deduction:** This is a definitive and unambiguous signature for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (forming a doublet) and by the three methyl protons (forming a quartet), which combine to create a \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, appearing as a simple \"doublet\". This fragment contributes **C₃H₅** (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens) and accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Second Methyl Group and Negative Evidence.**\n        *   **Evidence:** The spectrum shows a second signal for a `–CH₃` group. Critically, there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n        *   **Deduction:** This negative evidence is key. It rules out longer alkyl chains like an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`). Since one substituent is the propenyl group, the second substituent must contain the ester functionality and the second methyl group. The \"no -CH₂\" rule forces this to be a simple fragment like a **methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`)** or an **acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`)**. Both contribute the same number of atoms: 2 carbons (one C=O, one -CH₃) and 3 hydrogens.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, the complete molecular formula can be calculated.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring Fragment:** C₆H₄\n    *   **Propenyl Group Fragment:** C₃H₅\n    *   **Ester/Methyl Fragment:** C₂H₃O₂\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2\n\n    The final, logically deduced formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verification and Final Answer Selection:**\n    The result can be verified with the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):\n    *   DBE from formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂): DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6.\n    *   DBE from structure: 1 aromatic ring (4) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1) + 1 ester C=O bond (1) = 6.\n    The values match, confirming the result is self-consistent.\n\n    Comparing the derived formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** to the provided options:\n    A) C11H12O2\n    B) C12H12O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C12H14O2\n\nThe calculated formula matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a complete analysis of the question and the provided candidate answers, a definitive solution can be reached. The reasoning across all candidate answers is remarkably consistent and logically sound, with unanimous agreement on the identity of the molecular fragments and the final chemical formula. The only variations are in the letter assigned to the final answer, which is due to different ordering of the multiple-choice options in each agent's input.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis incorporating the most critical points from the collective reasoning:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis with Careful Points\n\n**1. Identify the Molecular Core and Oxygen Content.**\n*   **Information**: The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" and the FTIR spectrum shows an \"ester group.\"\n*   **Reasoning**: A benzene ring (C₆H₆) with two substituents becomes a **C₆H₄** fragment. The ¹H NMR confirms the 4 protons on this ring with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" The ester group (-COO-) accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms**.\n*   **Careful Point 1**: The deduction starts with a solid foundation by identifying the largest fragment, the C₆H₄ core, which contributes 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens to the final formula. The ester confirms the O₂ part of the formula.\n\n**2. Elucidate the First Substituent.**\n*   **Information**: The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n*   **Reasoning**: This complex splitting pattern is a highly specific and unambiguous signature. It can only correspond to a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group is split by its single vinyl neighbor (the doublet part) and the three protons of the methyl group (the quartet part), yielding the \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, appearing as a simple \"doublet\".\n*   **Careful Point 2**: This is the single most important piece of information. Correctly identifying the propenyl group from its unique NMR fingerprint is the key to solving the structure. This fragment contributes **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n\n**3. Elucidate the Second Substituent.**\n*   **Information**: The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" and \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"\n*   **Reasoning**: We have already accounted for one `-CH₃` group (in the propenyl fragment). The second `-CH₃` must be part of the ester substituent. The explicit absence of `-CH₂-` signals is crucial negative evidence.\n*   **Careful Point 3**: This \"no `-CH₂-` groups\" constraint rules out common ester fragments like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). The second methyl group must therefore be directly attached to the ester, forming a structure such as a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`). Both of these possible fragments contribute **C₂H₃O₂** to the final formula.\n\n**4. Assemble the Molecular Formula.**\n*   **Reasoning**: We sum the atomic compositions of all identified fragments.\n*   **Fragments**: `C₆H₄` (aromatic ring) + `C₃H₅` (propenyl group) + `C₂H₃O₂` (ester/methyl fragment)\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n*   **Careful Point 4**: The final step is a simple summation. The systematically deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**5. Verification and Final Selection.**\n*   The derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, is consistent with all spectroscopic data. The degree of unsaturation is 6 (4 for the ring, 1 for the C=C bond, 1 for the C=O bond), which matches the formula (DBE = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6).\n*   Comparing this correct formula to the options provided in the question:\n    A) C11H12O2\n    B) C11H14O2\n    C) C12H12O2\n    D) C12H14O2\n\nThe deduced formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula, based on the unanimous reasoning found in the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe solution to this problem lies in systematically breaking down the provided spectroscopic information into molecular fragments and then summing their atomic compositions to find the total molecular formula.\n\n**1. Aromatic Ring Fragment Identification**\n*   **Evidence**: The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". The ¹H NMR confirms this with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which accounts for the 4 protons remaining on a di-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Deduction**: The core of the molecule is a C₆H₄ fragment.\n*   **Contribution**: 6 Carbon atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms.\n\n**2. Ester Functional Group and Oxygen Count**\n*   **Evidence**: The FTIR spectrum shows an absorption peak for an \"ester group\".\n*   **Deduction**: The molecule contains a `-COO-` functional group.\n*   **Contribution**: 2 Oxygen atoms.\n\n**3. Substituent Identification using ¹H NMR Data**\nThis step uses the most specific details from the ¹H NMR to identify the two groups attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**\n    *   **Evidence**: The NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\".\n    *   **Deduction**: This is a classic, unambiguous fingerprint pattern for a propenyl group. The vinyl proton next to the methyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`) is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in the characteristic \"doublet of quartets\" signal. The other vinyl proton (`-CH=CH-CH₃`) is only split by its neighbor, resulting in a \"doublet\". This fragment also accounts for one of the two `-CH₃` groups.\n    *   **Contribution**: 3 Carbon atoms, 5 Hydrogen atoms (`C₃H₅`).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Second Methyl Group and the Power of Negative Evidence**\n    *   **Evidence**: The spectrum shows a second `-CH₃` signal, but critically, there are \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**\".\n    *   **Deduction**: Since one `-CH₃` is in the propenyl group, the second one must be part of the ester substituent. The \"no -CH₂\" rule is crucial; it eliminates the possibility of an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`) or other longer chains. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, as in a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy (`-OCOCH₃`) group.\n    *   **Contribution**: This fragment provides the remaining atoms: the carbonyl carbon (`C=O`), the second methyl group (`-CH₃`), and the two oxygens, for a total of 2 Carbon atoms and 3 Hydrogen atoms (`C₂H₃O₂`).\n\n**4. Assembling the Final Molecular Formula**\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n*   **Aromatic Ring**: C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group**: C₃H₅\n*   **Ester/Methyl Group**: C₂H₃O₂\n*   **Total Carbons (C)**: 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H)**: 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O)**: **2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**5. Verification and Final Answer Selection**\nTo confirm, we check the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):\n*   **From Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂)**: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6.\n*   **From Structure**: 1 aromatic ring (4 DBEs) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DBE) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DBE) = 6.\nThe values match, confirming the deduction.\n\nWe now compare the derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, with the options provided in the question:\nA) C12H12O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C11H14O2\n\nThe calculated formula matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
