It states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the lifetime (Δt or τ) are inversely related:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    For practical calculations, the minimum energy uncertainty, known as the \"natural linewidth,\" is approximated by:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ/τ\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy Width (Linewidth) for Each State:** A key insight from the principle is that a shorter lifetime leads to a larger energy width, making the energy level more \"smeared out.\"\n    *   **State 1:** Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n    *   **State 2:** Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n3.  **Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\":** To distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than their inherent widths. If the separation is smaller than the widths, their energy profiles will overlap to the point where they are indistinguishable. The primary limitation is the state with the *larger* energy width, which is State 1 (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV). For clear resolution, the energy difference |E₁ - E₂| must be greater than this value.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:** We must find the option that provides an energy difference greater than the limiting linewidth of ~6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV.

Many errors in this type of problem stem from misremembering this inverse relationship.\n*   **Limiting Factor:** The resolution of the entire system is limited by its least precise component. In this case, the state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the largest energy width and thus sets the minimum required energy separation for the levels to be distinguished.\n*   **Meaning of \"Resolve\":** The energy separation must be *larger* than the energy width.

The differences in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) arise because the options were likely presented to each agent in a randomized order. The final decision must be made by mapping the correct numerical value to the specific option list given in *this* problem.\n\nThe only energy difference large enough to allow for clear resolution is 10⁻⁴ eV. Based on the options provided in the question, this corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the question and a synthesis of the candidate answers, here is a detailed, step-by-step resolution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principle:** The problem concerns the ability to distinguish two quantum energy levels that have finite lifetimes. The fundamental physical principle governing this is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time**. This principle states that a state with a finite lifetime (τ) has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE). For practical calculations, this relationship is approximated as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:** A shorter lifetime implies a larger, more \"smeared-out\" energy level. We calculate the width for each state.\n    *   **State 1:** Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n    *   **State 2:** Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n3.  **Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\":** To distinguish, or \"resolve,\" the two energy levels, the difference between their central energies must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the separation is smaller, the energy profiles of the states will overlap so much that they become indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the *larger* energy width, which is State 1 (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV). A robust condition is that the separation should be greater than the sum of the widths:\n    Required Separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 × 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    Therefore, the energy difference must be larger than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options:** We must compare the given options with the calculated requirement that the energy difference must be greater than ~7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV (Too small)\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV = 0.0001 × 10⁻⁷ eV (Too small)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV (**Large enough**)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV (Too small)\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The Inverse Relationship:** It is crucial to remember that the state with the *shorter* lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the *larger* energy width and is therefore the primary factor limiting the resolution.\n2.  **Resolution Condition:** The condition \"clearly resolved\" means the energy difference must be *significantly greater* than the calculated energy widths. Options smaller than or comparable to the widths are incorrect.\n3.  **Correct Constant:** Using the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of electron-volt-seconds (eV·s) is essential for convenience, as the final options are given in eV.\n4.  **Synthesizing Agent Answers:** The candidate answers unanimously agree on the physical principle, the calculations, and the correct numerical value (10⁻⁴ eV). The variation in the final letter (A, B, C, D) is an artifact of the options being presented in a different random order to each agent. The correct final answer must be based on the option list provided in the question, not the letter provided by the agents.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that an energy separation greater than approximately 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV is required to resolve the two states. Among the given options, only 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to satisfy this condition. According to the option list in the question, this numerical value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a thorough synthesis of the provided candidate answers and a first-principles analysis, here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe problem asks for the condition to distinguish two quantum energy levels that have finite lifetimes. This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This fundamental principle of quantum mechanics states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt), its energy is not perfectly defined but has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" (ΔE). The relationship is expressed as:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\nFor practical calculations, the minimum energy width, also known as the \"natural linewidth,\" is approximated by the formula:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\nwhere:\n*   τ is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"**\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" the difference in their central energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. Each energy level is not a sharp line but is \"smeared out\" over a range ΔE. If the energy separation is smaller than these widths, their energy profiles will overlap to such an extent that they are indistinguishable. The resolution is primarily limited by the state with the **larger energy width**, which corresponds to the **shorter lifetime**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**\nWe use the given lifetimes and the reduced Planck constant to calculate the energy width for each state.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy Width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy Width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\nThe larger energy width is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. For the states to be clearly resolved, the energy difference between them must be greater than this value. A more conservative criterion is that the separation must be greater than the sum of the widths: ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\nWe now compare the minimum required energy separation (~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV) with the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV**\n*   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV**\n*   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV**\n*   **D) 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n*   A) **10⁻⁴ eV**: This value is equal to 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV, which is significantly **larger** than the required separation of ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This would allow the states to be clearly resolved.\n*   B) **10⁻⁹ eV**: This is equal to 0.01 x 10⁻⁷ eV, which is **smaller** than the required separation.\n*   C) **10⁻¹¹ eV**: This is many orders of magnitude **smaller** than the required separation.\n*   D) **10⁻⁸ eV**: This is equal to 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV, which is **smaller** than the required separation.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correct Principle:** It is crucial to identify and apply the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. A common error would be to assume energy levels are always perfectly sharp.\n2.  **Inverse Relationship:** One must correctly use the inverse relationship between lifetime (τ) and energy width (ΔE). The state with the **shorter** lifetime has the **larger**, more uncertain energy width, making it the limiting factor for resolution.\n3.  **Resolution Condition:** The energy separation must be **greater than** the energy widths. An energy separation that is equal to or less than the widths would result in significant overlap, preventing clear resolution.\n4.  **Consensus on Numerical Value:** There is an overwhelming consensus among all provided candidate answers on the physical reasoning, the calculation of the widths, and the final correct *numerical* value (10⁻⁴ eV). The discrepancies in the final *letter* choices (A, B, C, or D) among the candidate answers are artifacts of the options being presented to them in a different, randomized order.\n5.  **Mapping to the Prompt's Options:** The final answer must be mapped to the specific list of options presented in this question's prompt, where 10⁻⁴ eV corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the consensus from the candidate answers and highlighting important points.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle\n\nThe question requires relating the lifetime of a quantum state to the distinguishability of its energy level. The fundamental principle that governs this is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This principle states that a state with a finite lifetime (Δt) has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE). The relationship is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor practical calculations of this minimum energy width, often called the \"natural linewidth,\" we use the approximation:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ/τ\n\nwhere τ is the lifetime of the state and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Energy Width for Each State\n\nWe are given the lifetimes for two states:\n*   Lifetime of state 1: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Lifetime of state 2: τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\nUsing the formula, we calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state. The units of ħ (eV·s) are convenient as the final options are in eV.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n### Step 3: Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" the difference between their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. If the separation is smaller, the two \"smeared\" energy profiles will overlap to a degree where they are indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the **larger energy width**, which corresponds to the **shorter lifetime**.\n\nIn this case, the larger width is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, the energy separation must be significantly greater than this value. A robust condition for \"clear resolution\" is that the separation must be greater than the sum of the widths:\n\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 × 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ **7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\n\nWe must now compare this requirement (the energy difference must be greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV) with the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value (which is 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV) is much **larger** than the required separation. This would allow the states to be clearly resolved.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is much smaller than the required separation.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This (which is 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV) is smaller than the required separation.\n*   **D) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is far smaller than the required separation.\n\nThe only option that satisfies the condition for clear resolution is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **Correct Principle:** It is crucial to identify and apply the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n2.  **Inverse Relationship:** A key insight is the inverse relationship between lifetime and energy width: a **shorter** lifetime implies a **larger**, more uncertain energy width. The shorter-lived state (10⁻⁹ s) is the limiting factor for resolution.\n3.  **Resolution Condition:** The phrase \"clearly resolved\" means the energy difference must be *significantly greater* than the energy width. Options that are smaller than or of a similar magnitude to the width are incorrect.\n4.  **Numerical Value over Letter:** The candidate answers provided different letters (A, B, C, D). This is due to the test platform randomizing the option order for each agent. The physical reasoning and the final *numerical value* (10⁻⁴ eV) are, however, in complete agreement. The correct step is to derive the numerical answer and then map it to the corresponding letter in the specific prompt you are answering.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a final analysis based on the reasoning and the code output provided.\n\n### Final Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Core Physical Principle:** The problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time (ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2). This principle means that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (τ) has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy, which can be approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n\n2.  **Calculations from Code Output:** The provided code execution correctly calculates the energy width (ΔE) for each state:\n    *   For the state with a lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s, the energy width is **ΔE₁ = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV**.\n    *   For the state with a lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s, the energy width is **ΔE₂ = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV**.\n\n3.  **Condition for Clear Resolution:** To clearly distinguish between the two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than their energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy width (~6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV) and thus presents the main challenge for resolution. A reliable criterion, also calculated by the code, is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the two widths:\n    *   Required Separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    *   Required Separation > **7.240 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n4.  **Evaluation of Options:** We compare the given options to the requirement that the energy difference must be greater than ~7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is equivalent to 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is much **larger** than the required 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.

This is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. The principle is mathematically expressed as ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2. For practical calculations, we use the approximation for the minimum energy uncertainty (also called the natural linewidth, Γ):\n\nΓ ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere:\n*   Γ (or ΔE) is the energy width of the state.\n*   τ (or Δt) is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π), approximately **6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Energy Width for Each State\n\nWe are given two lifetimes and must calculate their corresponding energy widths.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width Γ₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width Γ₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\nThis calculation confirms that the state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width.\n\n### Step 3: Define the Condition for Clear Resolution\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" the difference between their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the separation is too small, their \"smeared\" energy profiles will overlap to the point where they are indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the larger energy width (Γ₁). A robust criterion for clear resolution is that the energy difference must be larger than the **sum of the individual widths**:\n\nRequired Separation > Γ₁ + Γ₂\nRequired Separation > (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV) ≈ **7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\nTherefore, we are looking for an energy difference that is substantially greater than ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\n\nNow, we compare the required separation to the options provided:\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This is equal to 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV.

This would allow the states to be clearly resolved.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than the required separation.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Correct Principle:** It is crucial to use the Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle (ΔE⋅Δt) and not the Position-Momentum one.\n2.  **Correct Constant:** Calculations must use the reduced Planck constant (ħ), not the Planck constant (h). The value in eV·s (≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) is the most convenient here.\n3.  **Inverse Relationship:** A *shorter* lifetime leads to a *larger* energy width. The state with τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s is broader and the main limiting factor for resolution.\n4.  **Resolution Condition:** The energy separation must be *greater* than the width(s) of the levels. Any separation smaller than the larger width (~6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV) makes resolution impossible.\n5.  **Interpreting \"Clearly Resolved\":** This term implies a separation significantly larger than the threshold. An option that is several orders of magnitude larger, like 10⁻⁴ eV, is a much better choice than one that is only slightly larger.\n6.  **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** Although the letter choices in the candidate answers varied, this was due to the options being presented in a different random order.

The fundamental principle governing this is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This principle establishes an intrinsic link between the lifetime of a quantum state (Δt or τ) and the uncertainty, or \"width,\" of its energy level (ΔE).

If the separation is smaller, the two \"smeared\" energy profiles will overlap to a degree where they are indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the **larger energy width**, which corresponds to the **shorter lifetime**.\n\nTherefore, the condition for resolution is that the energy separation, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than the limiting width. A conservative criterion is that it should be larger than the sum of the widths:\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV) ≈ **7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options against the Condition**\nWe now compare our required energy separation (> 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV) with the options provided in the question:\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV  (This is much smaller than the required separation).\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV   (This is smaller than the required separation).\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV = 0.0001 × 10⁻⁷ eV (This is far smaller than the required separation).\n*   D) **10⁻⁴ eV** = 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV   (This is much larger than the required separation).\n\nOnly an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure the states are clearly resolvable.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Inverse Relationship:** A critical point is the inverse relationship between lifetime and energy width.

If the separation is smaller, the energy profiles of the states will overlap so much that they become indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the *larger* energy width, which is State 1 (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV).

This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This fundamental principle of quantum mechanics states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt), its energy is not perfectly defined but has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" (ΔE). The relationship is expressed as:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\nFor practical calculations, the minimum energy width, also known as the \"natural linewidth,\" is approximated by the formula:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\nwhere:\n*   τ is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"**\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" the difference in their central energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. Each energy level is not a sharp line but is \"smeared out\" over a range ΔE. If the energy separation is smaller than these widths, their energy profiles will overlap to such an extent that they are indistinguishable. The resolution is primarily limited by the state with the **larger energy width**, which corresponds to the **shorter lifetime**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**\nWe use the given lifetimes and the reduced Planck constant to calculate the energy width for each state.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy Width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy Width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\nThe larger energy width is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. For the states to be clearly resolved, the energy difference between them must be greater than this value. A more conservative criterion is that the separation must be greater than the sum of the widths: ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\nWe now compare the minimum required energy separation (~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV) with the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV**\n*   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV**\n*   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV**\n*   **D) 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n*   A) **10⁻⁴ eV**: This value is equal to 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV, which is significantly **larger** than the required separation of ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This would allow the states to be clearly resolved.\n*   B) **10⁻⁹ eV**: This is equal to 0.01 x 10⁻⁷ eV, which is **smaller** than the required separation.\n*   C) **10⁻¹¹ eV**: This is many orders of magnitude **smaller** than the required separation.\n*   D) **10⁻⁸ eV**: This is equal to 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV, which is **smaller** than the required separation.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correct Principle:** It is crucial to identify and apply the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. A common error would be to assume energy levels are always perfectly sharp.\n2.  **Inverse Relationship:** One must correctly use the inverse relationship between lifetime (τ) and energy width (ΔE). The state with the **shorter** lifetime has the **larger**, more uncertain energy width, making it the limiting factor for resolution.\n3.  **Resolution Condition:** The energy separation must be **greater than** the energy widths. An energy separation that is equal to or less than the widths would result in significant overlap, preventing clear resolution.\n4.  **Consensus on Numerical Value:** There is an overwhelming consensus among all provided candidate answers on the physical reasoning, the calculation of the widths, and the final correct *numerical* value (10⁻⁴ eV). The discrepancies in the final *letter* choices (A, B, C, or D) among the candidate answers are artifacts of the options being presented to them in a different, randomized order.\n5.  **Mapping to the Prompt's Options:** The final answer must be mapped to the specific list of options presented in this question's prompt, where 10⁻⁴ eV corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the consensus from the candidate answers and highlighting important points.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle\n\nThe question requires relating the lifetime of a quantum state to the distinguishability of its energy level. The fundamental principle that governs this is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This principle states that a state with a finite lifetime (Δt) has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE).

The fundamental principle governing this is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This principle establishes a trade-off: a state with a short lifetime cannot have a precisely defined energy. The mathematical relationship is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor practical calculations of the minimum energy uncertainty, known as the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width,\" we use the approximation:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ/τ\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the state's energy.\n*   τ is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately **6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s**.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths.

This is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. The principle is mathematically expressed as ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2. For practical calculations, we use the approximation for the minimum energy uncertainty (also called the natural linewidth, Γ):\n\nΓ ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere:\n*   Γ (or ΔE) is the energy width of the state.\n*   τ (or Δt) is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π), approximately **6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Energy Width for Each State\n\nWe are given two lifetimes and must calculate their corresponding energy widths.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width Γ₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width Γ₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\nThis calculation confirms that the state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width.\n\n### Step 3: Define the Condition for Clear Resolution\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" the difference between their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the separation is too small, their \"smeared\" energy profiles will overlap to the point where they are indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the larger energy width (Γ₁). A robust criterion for clear resolution is that the energy difference must be larger than the **sum of the individual widths**:\n\nRequired Separation > Γ₁ + Γ₂\nRequired Separation > (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV) ≈ **7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\nTherefore, we are looking for an energy difference that is substantially greater than ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\n\nNow, we compare the required separation to the options provided:\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This is equal to 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV.

Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\nThe problem asks about the conditions needed to distinguish between two quantum energy levels that have finite lifetimes. The fundamental physical principle governing this is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This principle establishes an inverse relationship between the precision of a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt or τ).

This would allow the states to be clearly resolved.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than the required separation.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Correct Principle:** It is crucial to use the Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle (ΔE⋅Δt) and not the Position-Momentum one.\n2.  **Correct Constant:** Calculations must use the reduced Planck constant (ħ), not the Planck constant (h). The value in eV·s (≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) is the most convenient here.\n3.  **Inverse Relationship:** A *shorter* lifetime leads to a *larger* energy width. The state with τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s is broader and the main limiting factor for resolution.\n4.  **Resolution Condition:** The energy separation must be *greater* than the width(s) of the levels. Any separation smaller than the larger width (~6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV) makes resolution impossible.\n5.  **Interpreting \"Clearly Resolved\":** This term implies a separation significantly larger than the threshold. An option that is several orders of magnitude larger, like 10⁻⁴ eV, is a much better choice than one that is only slightly larger.\n6.  **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** Although the letter choices in the candidate answers varied, this was due to the options being presented in a different random order.

The fundamental principle governing this is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This principle establishes an intrinsic link between the lifetime of a quantum state (Δt or τ) and the uncertainty, or \"width,\" of its energy level (ΔE). The mathematical relationship is:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor practical calculations of the minimum energy width (also known as the natural linewidth), we use the approximation:\nΔE ≈ ħ/τ\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**\nWe need to calculate the energy width for each of the two states using their given lifetimes.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n**Step 3: Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"**\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. If the separation is smaller, the two \"smeared\" energy profiles will overlap to a degree where they are indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the **larger energy width**, which corresponds to the **shorter lifetime**.\n\nTherefore, the condition for resolution is that the energy separation, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than the limiting width. A conservative criterion is that it should be larger than the sum of the widths:\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV) ≈ **7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options against the Condition**\nWe now compare our required energy separation (> 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV) with the options provided in the question:\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV  (This is much smaller than the required separation).\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV   (This is smaller than the required separation).\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV = 0.0001 × 10⁻⁷ eV (This is far smaller than the required separation).\n*   D) **10⁻⁴ eV** = 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV   (This is much larger than the required separation).\n\nOnly an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure the states are clearly resolvable.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Inverse Relationship:** A critical point is the inverse relationship between lifetime and energy width.

All the candidate answers correctly identify that this is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. The principle establishes a fundamental limit on the precision with which the energy of a state (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt or τ) can be simultaneously known. The relationship is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor practical calculations, the minimum energy uncertainty, known as the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width,\" is approximated by:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ/τ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Energy Width for Each State\n\nWe use the provided lifetimes and the value of ħ to find the energy width of each state.\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy Width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy Width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n### Step 3: Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" the two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. Each level is not a sharp line but is \"smeared out\" over a range ΔE. If the separation between the levels is smaller than these widths, their profiles will overlap to the point where they are indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the *larger* energy width.\n\n*   **Required Separation > Largest Width**: A basic condition is that the separation must be greater than the larger of the two widths, which is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **Required Separation > Sum of Widths**: A more robust criterion is that the separation must be greater than the sum of both widths: ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nGiven the large differences between the options, either criterion leads to the same answer. We need an energy separation greater than approximately 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\n\nNow we compare the calculated requirement with the options provided in the question:\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (Much smaller than the required 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV    (Much smaller than the required 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV    (Smaller than the required 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV** (Equal to 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is much larger than the required 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly the energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is sufficiently large to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Inverse Relationship:** It is critical to remember that the *shorter* lifetime (τ = 10⁻⁹ s) corresponds to the *larger* energy width (ΔE ≈ 10⁻⁷ eV). This larger width is the primary factor limiting the resolution.\n2.  **Resolution Means Separation > Width:** The core concept is that for levels to be distinct, their energy separation must be significantly *greater* than their inherent widths. An energy separation smaller than the widths would mean the energy profiles overlap significantly, making them unresolved.\n3.  **Analyzing Candidate Answer Discrepancies:** The candidate answers show unanimous agreement on the physics, the calculation, and the final numerical value of 10⁻⁴ eV. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are an artifact of the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. This does not indicate a disagreement on the correct answer, but rather a difference in the test-taking environment.\n4.  **Final Mapping:** The correct procedure is to perform the physical calculation to find the required numerical value (10⁻⁴ eV) and then map it to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\nFor the given options, the value 10⁻⁴ eV corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
