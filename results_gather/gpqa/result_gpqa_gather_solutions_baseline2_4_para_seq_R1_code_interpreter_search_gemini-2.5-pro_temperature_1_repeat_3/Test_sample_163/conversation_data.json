For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass (`M_total = m₁ + m₂`) is determined by a form of Kepler's Third Law:\n    `M_total = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n    where `P` is the orbital period, `K₁` and `K₂` are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n2.  **Apply the Key Simplifying Condition:** The problem provides the crucial information that both systems are **\"eclipsing\"**.

The correct formula for the total mass (`M_total = m₁ + m₂`) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    `M_total = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n    where `P` is the orbital period, `K₁` and `K₂` are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n2.  **Apply the Simplifying Condition:** A crucial piece of information, correctly identified by all agents, is that both systems are **\"eclipsing\"**. This means we observe them from a vantage point nearly in their orbital plane. Therefore, the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°, which simplifies `sin(i)` to ~1 and `sin³(i)` to ~1.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mass Ratio:** The goal is to calculate the ratio `M₁ / M₂`. When this ratio is formed, the constant terms (`1 / (2πG)`) cancel out. Since `sin³(i)` is approximately 1 for both eclipsing systems, this term also cancels. This leads to a simple, direct proportionality:\n    `M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n\n4.  **Extract Data and Perform Calculations:** The next step is to use the data provided in the question.\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period `P₁` = 2 years\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₁_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period `P₂` = 1 year\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₂_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n    Now, substitute these values into the proportionality to find the ratio `M₁ / M₂`:\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁_total)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_total)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15/25)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3/5)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculation robustly and unanimously yields `0.432`.

The variance in the final letter choice is solely due to the options being presented in a different order. The following is a consolidated, step-by-step breakdown of the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Goal and Relevant Physical Law**\nThe task is to find the ratio of the total mass of `system_1` (`M₁`) to the total mass of `system_2` (`M₂`). The fundamental physical law governing the total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n`M_total = m₁ + m₂ = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\nwhere `P` is the orbital period, `K₁` and `K₂` are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n**2. Apply the Crucial Simplifying Condition**\nThe problem states that both systems are **\"eclipsing\"**. This is the key piece of information that makes the problem solvable without more data. Eclipses can only be observed when the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, which means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°.\nFor `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and consequently `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This simplification is valid for both systems.\n\n**3. Formulate the Mass Ratio**\nWhen calculating a ratio of two quantities with the same underlying formula, universal constants and common terms cancel out. In this case, when we compute `M₁ / M₂`, the constant term `1 / (2 * π * G)` and the geometric term `sin³(i)` (which is ≈ 1 for both) cancel, leaving a simple proportionality:\n`M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n\n**4. Extract Data and Perform Calculations**\nNext, we gather the data provided in the question:\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Period `P₁` = 2 years\n    *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₁_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = **15 km/s**\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Period `P₂` = 1 year\n    *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₂_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = **25 km/s**\n\nNow, substitute these values into the proportionality:\n`M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁_total)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_total)³]`\n`M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n\nTo simplify the arithmetic:\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15 / 25)³`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\n**5. Match the Result to the Given Options**\nThe calculated factor is **0.432**. We now compare this value to the options provided in the original question prompt:\n*   A) ~ 0.4\n*   B) ~ 0.7\n*   C) ~ 0.6\n*   D) ~ 1.2\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is unambiguously closest to 0.4.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **The \"Eclipsing\" Clue is Essential:** Without the information that the systems are eclipsing, the `sin³(i)` term for each system would be unknown, making the problem unsolvable. This is the most critical piece of non-numerical data in the problem.\n*   **Sum Before Cubing:** The formula requires the sum of the velocity amplitudes (`K₁ + K₂`) to be cubed. It is a common mistake to cube the individual velocities first (`K₁³ + K₂³`), which would lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Ratios Simplify Calculations:** By setting up the problem as a ratio from the start, we eliminate the need to know the value of the gravitational constant `G` and to perform unit conversions (e.g., from years to seconds), as all units cancel out.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn analysis of the 15 candidate answers reveals a strong consensus. All agents correctly identified the relevant physical principles, the necessary formula, and performed the same calculation to arrive at an identical numerical result. The only discrepancies arose from matching this result to a specific lettered option, which was due to the options being presented in a different order for each agent.\n\nHere is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis to determine the definitive answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. The Governing Physical Formula**\n\nThe total mass (`M_total = m₁ + m₂`) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is given by a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n`M_total = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\nwhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K₁` and `K₂` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves.\n*   `G` is the universal gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to the observer's line of sight.\n\n**2. The Critical Simplification from Observation**\n\nThe problem provides a key piece of information: both systems are **\"eclipsing.\"** This has a direct physical implication. Eclipses can only be observed when the system's orbit is viewed nearly edge-on.\n*   This means the inclination angle `i` must be approximately 90°.\n*   For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and consequently `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\nThis simplification is valid for both systems.\n\n**3. Establishing the Proportionality for a Mass Ratio**\n\nThe question asks for a factor, which is the ratio of the two masses (`M₁ / M₂`). When forming this ratio, several terms cancel:\n*   The universal constant term `1 / (2πG)` is the same for both systems and cancels out.\n*   The `sin³(i)` term is approximately 1 for both systems and also cancels.\n\nThis leaves a simple, direct proportionality:\n`M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n\n**4. Data Extraction and Calculation**\n\nNext, we extract the given data and perform the calculation using the proportionality.\n\n*   **For System 1:**\n    *   Period `P₁` = 2 years\n    *   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes `K₁_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n*   **For System 2:**\n    *   Period `P₂` = 1 year\n    *   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes `K₂_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we calculate the mass ratio `M₁ / M₂`:\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁_total)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_total)³]`\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n\nTo simplify, we can handle the ratio of the cubed terms first:\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15 / 25)³`\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\nAll 15 candidate agents correctly calculated this value.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated factor is `0.432`. We now compare this result to the specific options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) ~ 0.6\n*   B) ~ 0.4\n*   C) ~ 0.7\n*   D) ~ 1.2\n\nThe calculated value of `0.432` is unambiguously closest to `0.4`.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **The \"eclipsing\" clue is essential.** Without this information, the `sin³(i)` term would be unknown, and the problem would be unsolvable.\n*   **The velocities must be summed first.** The formula uses `(K₁ + K₂)³`, not `K₁³ + K₂³`. It's the total velocity range that matters.\n*   **Units do not need to be converted to SI.** Because we are calculating a ratio, the units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) cancel out, as long as they are consistent between the two systems. Setting up the ratio from the start is the most efficient solution path.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on an analysis of the question and the provided candidate answers, a single, correct methodology emerges. The consensus on the physics and calculation is unanimous, with minor differences in final letter choices stemming only from shuffled option lists in the prompts given to each agent.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. This is a request for the ratio of their total masses: `M₁ / M₂`.\n\n2.  **Select the Correct Physical Formula:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where spectral lines from both stars are visible), the total mass (`M_total = m₁ + m₂`) is given by a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    `M_total = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n    Where `P` is the period, `K₁` and `K₂` are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply the Critical Simplifying Condition:** The problem states that both systems are **\"eclipsing.\"** This is a crucial piece of information. Eclipses can only occur if our line of sight is almost perfectly aligned with the system's orbital plane. This implies that the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°.\n    *   For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n    *   This simplification holds for both systems.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Proportionality for the Ratio:** To find the ratio `M₁ / M₂`, we can divide the formula for system 1 by the formula for system 2. When we do this, the constant term `1 / (2πG)` and the geometric term `sin³(i)` (which is ~1 for both) cancel out. This leaves a simple and powerful proportionality:\n    `M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n\n5.  **Extract Data and Perform Calculations:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period `P₁` = 2 years\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₁_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = **15 km/s**\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period `P₂` = 1 year\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₂_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = **25 km/s**\n\n    Now, substitute these values into the proportionality:\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁_total)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_total)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15 / 25)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\n6.  **Match with Options:** The calculated factor is **0.432**. We compare this to the options given in the problem statement:\n    *   A) ~ 0.7\n    *   B) ~ 0.4\n    *   C) ~ 1.2\n    *   D) ~ 0.6\n\n    The calculated value of `0.432` is unambiguously closest to `0.4`.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n*   **The \"eclipsing\" clue is essential.** Without this information, the inclination `i` for each system would be an unknown variable, making the problem unsolvable.\n*   **The velocities must be summed before being cubed.** A common mistake would be to cube the velocities individually (`K₁³ + K₂³`), which is incorrect. The formula requires the cube of the sum `(K₁ + K₂)³`.\n*   **Setting up a ratio is the most efficient method.** By creating the ratio `M₁/M₂` from the start, all physical constants (`G`) and geometric terms (`sin³i`) cancel out, simplifying the calculation and eliminating the need to look up constant values.\n*   **Unit consistency is sufficient.** Since we are calculating a dimensionless ratio, there is no need to convert years to seconds or km/s to m/s, as the units will cancel out.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the fifteen candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical principles, the calculation method, and the final numerical result.

This simplifies the relationship to a direct proportionality, which is the most efficient way to solve the problem:\n    `M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n\n4.  **Extract Data and Perform Intermediate Calculations**: The next step is to gather the data from the problem description:\n    *   **System 1**:\n        *   Period `P₁` = 2 years\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₁_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = **15 km/s**\n    *   **System 2**:\n        *   Period `P₂` = 1 year\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₂_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = **25 km/s**\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio**: Using the proportionality, we substitute the values to find the ratio `M₁ / M₂`:\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁_total)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_total)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15/25)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3/5)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\nThe numerical result, `0.432`, is robustly confirmed across all provided solutions.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The \"Eclipsing\" Clue**: This is the most critical piece of information. Without it, the inclination `i` for each system would be an unknown variable, making the mass ratio impossible to determine definitively.\n*   **Sum of Velocities**: The formula uses the sum of the velocity amplitudes `(K₁ + K₂)`. It is important to sum these values *before* cubing the result.\n*   **Use of Ratios**: Setting up the problem as a ratio from the start is the most efficient method. It avoids having to calculate the individual masses and cancels out physical constants (`G`) and units, which simplifies the arithmetic and reduces the chance of error.\n*   **Reading the Question**: The question asks for the factor by which \"system_1 is more massive than system_2\", which directly corresponds to the ratio `M₁ / M₂`. A value less than 1 indicates system_1 is actually *less* massive.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation unanimously and correctly yields that the mass of system_1 is `0.432` times the mass of system_2.

For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where spectral lines from both stars are visible), the total mass (`M_total = m₁ + m₂`) is given by a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    `M_total = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n    Where `P` is the orbital period, `K₁` and `K₂` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n2.  **Apply the Critical Simplifying Condition:** A crucial piece of information in the problem is that both systems are **\"eclipsing\"**. This has a direct and significant implication for the orbital inclination `i`. For eclipses to occur, the observer's line of sight must be very close to the plane of the orbit. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n    *   If `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n    *   This simplification applies to both system_1 and system_2.\n\n3.  **Establish a Proportionality for the Mass Ratio:** The question asks for a factor, which is the ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 (`M₁ / M₂`). When forming this ratio, several terms cancel out:\n    *   The constant term `1 / (2πG)` is present in both the numerator and the denominator.\n    *   The term `sin³(i)`, which is approximately 1 for both systems, also cancels.\n    This simplifies the relationship to a direct proportionality, which is the key to solving the problem efficiently:\n    **`M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`**\n\n4.  **Extract Data and Calculate Intermediate Values:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period `P₁` = 2 years\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₁_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = **15 km/s**\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period `P₂` = 1 year\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₂_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = **25 km/s**\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** Using the proportionality, we substitute the values:\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁_total)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_total)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15 / 25)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = **0.432**`\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **The \"Eclipsing\" Clue is Essential:** This single word is the most important piece of information outside of the numbers. Without it, the inclination angle `i` for both systems would be unknown, making the problem unsolvable.\n*   **Order of Operations:** It is critical to sum the velocities (`K₁ + K₂`) *before* cubing the result. Calculating `K₁³ + K₂³` is a common mistake and would lead to a wrong answer.\n*   **Unit Cancellation:** Since the problem asks for a dimensionless ratio and the units used for each system are consistent (years for period, km/s for velocity), there is no need to convert values to a standard system like SI units. The units cancel out during the ratio calculation, simplifying the process.\n*   **Interpreting the Question:** The question asks \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2,\" which directly translates to calculating the ratio `M₁ / M₂`. Inverting the ratio would yield an incorrect result (`1 / 0.432 ≈ 2.31`).\n*   **Consensus of Methods:** The fact that all 15 candidate answers, despite their different final letter choices, arrived at the exact same numerical result of `0.432` provides extremely high confidence in the correctness of the physical reasoning and calculation.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated factor is **0.432**.

This leads to a simple, direct proportionality:\n    `M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n\n4.  **Extract Data and Perform Calculations:** The next step is to use the data provided in the question.\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period `P₁` = 2 years\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₁_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period `P₂` = 1 year\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₂_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n    Now, substitute these values into the proportionality to find the ratio `M₁ / M₂`:\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁_total)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_total)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15/25)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3/5)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculation robustly and unanimously yields `0.432`.

The variance in the final letter choice is solely due to the options being presented in a different order. The following is a consolidated, step-by-step breakdown of the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Goal and Relevant Physical Law**\nThe task is to find the ratio of the total mass of `system_1` (`M₁`) to the total mass of `system_2` (`M₂`). The fundamental physical law governing the total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n`M_total = m₁ + m₂ = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\nwhere `P` is the orbital period, `K₁` and `K₂` are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n**2. Apply the Crucial Simplifying Condition**\nThe problem states that both systems are **\"eclipsing\"**. This is the key piece of information that makes the problem solvable without more data. Eclipses can only be observed when the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, which means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°.\nFor `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and consequently `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This simplification is valid for both systems.\n\n**3. Formulate the Mass Ratio**\nWhen calculating a ratio of two quantities with the same underlying formula, universal constants and common terms cancel out. In this case, when we compute `M₁ / M₂`, the constant term `1 / (2 * π * G)` and the geometric term `sin³(i)` (which is ≈ 1 for both) cancel, leaving a simple proportionality:\n`M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n\n**4. Extract Data and Perform Calculations**\nNext, we gather the data provided in the question:\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Period `P₁` = 2 years\n    *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₁_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = **15 km/s**\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Period `P₂` = 1 year\n    *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₂_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = **25 km/s**\n\nNow, substitute these values into the proportionality:\n`M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁_total)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_total)³]`\n`M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n\nTo simplify the arithmetic:\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15 / 25)³`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\n**5. Match the Result to the Given Options**\nThe calculated factor is **0.432**. We now compare this value to the options provided in the original question prompt:\n*   A) ~ 0.4\n*   B) ~ 0.7\n*   C) ~ 0.6\n*   D) ~ 1.2\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is unambiguously closest to 0.4.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **The \"Eclipsing\" Clue is Essential:** Without the information that the systems are eclipsing, the `sin³(i)` term for each system would be unknown, making the problem unsolvable. This is the most critical piece of non-numerical data in the problem.\n*   **Sum Before Cubing:** The formula requires the sum of the velocity amplitudes (`K₁ + K₂`) to be cubed. It is a common mistake to cube the individual velocities first (`K₁³ + K₂³`), which would lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Ratios Simplify Calculations:** By setting up the problem as a ratio from the start, we eliminate the need to know the value of the gravitational constant `G` and to perform unit conversions (e.g., from years to seconds), as all units cancel out.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn analysis of the 15 candidate answers reveals a strong consensus. All agents correctly identified the relevant physical principles, the necessary formula, and performed the same calculation to arrive at an identical numerical result. The only discrepancies arose from matching this result to a specific lettered option, which was due to the options being presented in a different order for each agent.\n\nHere is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis to determine the definitive answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. The Governing Physical Formula**\n\nThe total mass (`M_total = m₁ + m₂`) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is given by a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n`M_total = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\nwhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K₁` and `K₂` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves.\n*   `G` is the universal gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to the observer's line of sight.\n\n**2. The Critical Simplification from Observation**\n\nThe problem provides a key piece of information: both systems are **\"eclipsing.\"** This has a direct physical implication. Eclipses can only be observed when the system's orbit is viewed nearly edge-on.\n*   This means the inclination angle `i` must be approximately 90°.\n*   For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and consequently `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\nThis simplification is valid for both systems.\n\n**3. Establishing the Proportionality for a Mass Ratio**\n\nThe question asks for a factor, which is the ratio of the two masses (`M₁ / M₂`). When forming this ratio, several terms cancel:\n*   The universal constant term `1 / (2πG)` is the same for both systems and cancels out.\n*   The `sin³(i)` term is approximately 1 for both systems and also cancels.\n\nThis leaves a simple, direct proportionality:\n`M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n\n**4. Data Extraction and Calculation**\n\nNext, we extract the given data and perform the calculation using the proportionality.\n\n*   **For System 1:**\n    *   Period `P₁` = 2 years\n    *   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes `K₁_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n*   **For System 2:**\n    *   Period `P₂` = 1 year\n    *   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes `K₂_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we calculate the mass ratio `M₁ / M₂`:\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁_total)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_total)³]`\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n\nTo simplify, we can handle the ratio of the cubed terms first:\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15 / 25)³`\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\nAll 15 candidate agents correctly calculated this value.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated factor is `0.432`. We now compare this result to the specific options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) ~ 0.6\n*   B) ~ 0.4\n*   C) ~ 0.7\n*   D) ~ 1.2\n\nThe calculated value of `0.432` is unambiguously closest to `0.4`.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **The \"eclipsing\" clue is essential.** Without this information, the `sin³(i)` term would be unknown, and the problem would be unsolvable.\n*   **The velocities must be summed first.** The formula uses `(K₁ + K₂)³`, not `K₁³ + K₂³`. It's the total velocity range that matters.\n*   **Units do not need to be converted to SI.** Because we are calculating a ratio, the units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) cancel out, as long as they are consistent between the two systems. Setting up the ratio from the start is the most efficient solution path.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on an analysis of the question and the provided candidate answers, a single, correct methodology emerges. The consensus on the physics and calculation is unanimous, with minor differences in final letter choices stemming only from shuffled option lists in the prompts given to each agent.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. This is a request for the ratio of their total masses: `M₁ / M₂`.\n\n2.  **Select the Correct Physical Formula:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where spectral lines from both stars are visible), the total mass (`M_total = m₁ + m₂`) is given by a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    `M_total = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n    Where `P` is the period, `K₁` and `K₂` are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply the Critical Simplifying Condition:** The problem states that both systems are **\"eclipsing.\"** This is a crucial piece of information. Eclipses can only occur if our line of sight is almost perfectly aligned with the system's orbital plane. This implies that the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°.\n    *   For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n    *   This simplification holds for both systems.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Proportionality for the Ratio:** To find the ratio `M₁ / M₂`, we can divide the formula for system 1 by the formula for system 2. When we do this, the constant term `1 / (2πG)` and the geometric term `sin³(i)` (which is ~1 for both) cancel out. This leaves a simple and powerful proportionality:\n    `M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n\n5.  **Extract Data and Perform Calculations:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period `P₁` = 2 years\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₁_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = **15 km/s**\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period `P₂` = 1 year\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₂_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = **25 km/s**\n\n    Now, substitute these values into the proportionality:\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁_total)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_total)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15 / 25)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\n6.  **Match with Options:** The calculated factor is **0.432**.

The formula requires the cube of the sum `(K₁ + K₂)³`.\n*   **Setting up a ratio is the most efficient method.** By creating the ratio `M₁/M₂` from the start, all physical constants (`G`) and geometric terms (`sin³i`) cancel out, simplifying the calculation and eliminating the need to look up constant values.\n*   **Unit consistency is sufficient.** Since we are calculating a dimensionless ratio, there is no need to convert years to seconds or km/s to m/s, as the units will cancel out.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the fifteen candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical principles, the calculation method, and the final numerical result.

The minor discrepancies in the final letter choices are evidently due to the options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the key points.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\n\nThe problem requires calculating the ratio of the total masses of two binary star systems. The total mass (`M_total = m₁ + m₂`) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary is given by a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n`M_total = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\nwhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K₁` and `K₂` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves.\n*   `G` is the universal gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n**2. Apply the Key Simplifying Condition**\n\nA crucial piece of information is that both systems are **\"eclipsing\"**. This has a direct and vital consequence: for eclipses to be observable, the system's orbital plane must be nearly aligned with our line of sight.\n*   This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n*   For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n*   This simplification applies to both systems.\n\n**3. Formulate a Proportionality for the Mass Ratio**\n\nSince the goal is to find the ratio `M₁ / M₂`, any terms that are constant for both systems will cancel out. The `1 / (2πG)` term is a universal constant, and the `sin³(i)` term is approximately 1 for both. This simplifies the relationship to a direct proportionality:\n`M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n\n**4. Extract Data and Perform Intermediate Calculations**\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Period `P₁` = 2 years\n    *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₁_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Period `P₂` = 1 year\n    *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₂_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Ratio**\n\nUsing the proportionality, we can calculate the factor by which system 1 is more massive than system 2 (`M₁ / M₂`):\n`M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁_total)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_total)³]`\n\nSubstituting the values:\n`M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15 / 25)³`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **The \"eclipsing\" clue is essential.** Without this information, the `sin³(i)` term would be an unknown for each system, making the problem unsolvable.\n*   **The sum of velocities must be cubed.** The formula uses `(K₁ + K₂)³`, not `K₁³ + K₂³`. The velocities must be added before the cubing operation.\n*   **Using a ratio simplifies the problem.** Setting up the problem as a ratio from the beginning is the most efficient method, as it allows for the cancellation of physical constants (`G`) and the geometric term (`sin³(i)`), avoiding the need to look up or use their actual values.\n*   **Unit consistency is sufficient.** Since it is a ratio, as long as the units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) are the same for both systems, there is no need to convert them to SI units (seconds and meters/second).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation robustly and unanimously yields `0.432`. We compare this numerical result to the specific options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) ~ 0.4\n*   B) ~ 0.6\n*   C) ~ 1.2\n*   D) ~ 0.7\n\nThe calculated value of `0.432` is unambiguously closest to `0.4`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a remarkable consensus. All 15 answers correctly identify the physical principles, the necessary formula, the simplification based on the problem's conditions, and the final numerical result. The only discrepancies lie in matching the result to a lettered option, which is clearly an artifact of the options being presented in a different order to each agent.\n\nHere is a consolidated, step-by-step solution that outlines the unanimous reasoning.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Law:** The question requires comparing the total masses of two binary star systems. The total mass (`M_total = m₁ + m₂`) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is determined by a form of Kepler's Third Law:\n    `M_total = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n    Where `P` is the orbital period, `K₁` and `K₂` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n2.  **Apply the Key Simplifying Condition:** The problem provides the crucial information that both systems are **\"eclipsing\"**. This has a direct physical implication: eclipses are only observable when our line of sight is nearly parallel to the orbital plane. This means the inclination angle `i` for both systems is approximately 90°. For an angle of 90°, `sin(90°) = 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Simplified Ratio:** The goal is to find the ratio `M₁ / M₂`. When forming this ratio, the constant term `1 / (2πG)` and the geometric term `sin³(i)` (which is ≈ 1 for both systems) appear in both the numerator and denominator and thus cancel out. This leaves a simple and powerful proportionality:\n    `M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n\n4.  **Extract Data and Perform Intermediate Calculations:** The next step is to collect the data provided in the question:\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period `P₁` = 2 years\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₁_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = **15 km/s**\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period `P₂` = 1 year\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₂_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = **25 km/s**\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** Using the proportionality from Step 3, we can calculate the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2:\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁_total)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_total)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15/25)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3/5)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **The \"Eclipsing\" Clue:** This is the most important piece of information after the numerical values. Without it, the inclination `i` would be unknown, and the problem would be unsolvable.\n*   **The Power of Ratios:** Setting up the problem as a ratio from the start is the most efficient method. It allows for the cancellation of physical constants (`G`, `2π`) and the geometric `sin³(i)` term, simplifying the calculation significantly.\n*   **Sum Before Cubing:** The formula requires the sum of the velocity amplitudes (`K₁ + K₂`) to be cubed. It is a common mistake to cube the velocities individually before summing them.\n*   **Unit Consistency:** As this is a ratio calculation, there is no need to convert the units (years, km/s) to a standard system like SI, as long as they are consistent between the two systems. The units will cancel out.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation robustly and unanimously shows that the mass of system_1 is **0.432** times the mass of system_2.

The minor discrepancies in the lettered choice are due to variations in how the options were presented to each agent.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Law:** The problem involves finding the total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system. The relationship between the system's total mass (`M_total = m₁ + m₂`), its orbital period (`P`), the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of its components (`K₁` and `K₂`), and its orbital inclination (`i`) is given by Kepler's Third Law, expressed as:\n    `M_total = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n    where `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n2.  **Apply the Crucial Simplifying Condition:** The problem provides the critical information that both systems are **\"eclipsing\"**. This has a direct geometric implication: eclipses are only observable when the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on. Therefore, the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°. For an angle of 90°, `sin(i) = 1`, and thus `sin³(i) = 1`. This simplification is applicable to both systems.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mass Ratio:** The question asks for the ratio of the mass of system 1 to the mass of system 2 (`M₁ / M₂`). When setting up this ratio, any universal constants and terms that are the same for both systems will cancel out. The `(2 * π * G)` term is a constant, and the `sin³(i)` term is approximately 1 for both. This leaves a simple and direct proportionality:\n    `M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n\n4.  **Extract Data and Calculate Intermediate Values:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period `P₁` = 2 years\n        *   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes `K₁_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period `P₂` = 1 year\n        *   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes `K₂_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:** Using the proportionality, we can compute the ratio `M₁ / M₂`.\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁_total)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_total)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15/25)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3/5)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\n6.  **Compare Result with Options:** The calculated factor is `0.432`.

The correct physical principle, as identified by all candidates, is a form of Kepler's Third Law tailored for double-lined spectroscopic binaries:\n    `M_total = m₁ + m₂ = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n    Where `M_total` is the sum of the stellar masses, `P` is the orbital period, `K₁` and `K₂` are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n2.  **Apply the Critical Simplifying Condition**: The problem states that both systems are **\"eclipsing\"**. This is a crucial piece of information, not just flavor text. For eclipses to be observable, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the stars. This implies that the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n    *   If `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and consequently `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n    *   This simplification applies to both systems, making the problem solvable without knowing the exact inclinations.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Proportionality for the Mass Ratio**: The question asks for the ratio of the mass of system 1 to the mass of system 2 (`M₁ / M₂`). When forming this ratio, all the constant terms (`1 / (2 * π * G)`) and the geometric term (`sin³(i) ≈ 1`) cancel out. This simplifies the relationship to a direct proportionality, which is the most efficient way to solve the problem:\n    `M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n\n4.  **Extract Data and Perform Intermediate Calculations**: The next step is to gather the data from the problem description:\n    *   **System 1**:\n        *   Period `P₁` = 2 years\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₁_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = **15 km/s**\n    *   **System 2**:\n        *   Period `P₂` = 1 year\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₂_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = **25 km/s**\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio**: Using the proportionality, we substitute the values to find the ratio `M₁ / M₂`:\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁_total)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_total)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15/25)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3/5)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\nThe numerical result, `0.432`, is robustly confirmed across all provided solutions.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The \"Eclipsing\" Clue**: This is the most critical piece of information. Without it, the inclination `i` for each system would be an unknown variable, making the mass ratio impossible to determine definitively.\n*   **Sum of Velocities**: The formula uses the sum of the velocity amplitudes `(K₁ + K₂)`. It is important to sum these values *before* cubing the result.\n*   **Use of Ratios**: Setting up the problem as a ratio from the start is the most efficient method. It avoids having to calculate the individual masses and cancels out physical constants (`G`) and units, which simplifies the arithmetic and reduces the chance of error.\n*   **Reading the Question**: The question asks for the factor by which \"system_1 is more massive than system_2\", which directly corresponds to the ratio `M₁ / M₂`. A value less than 1 indicates system_1 is actually *less* massive.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation unanimously and correctly yields that the mass of system_1 is `0.432` times the mass of system_2.

For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where spectral lines from both stars are visible), the total mass (`M_total = m₁ + m₂`) is given by a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    `M_total = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n    Where `P` is the orbital period, `K₁` and `K₂` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n2.  **Apply the Critical Simplifying Condition:** A crucial piece of information in the problem is that both systems are **\"eclipsing\"**. This has a direct and significant implication for the orbital inclination `i`. For eclipses to occur, the observer's line of sight must be very close to the plane of the orbit. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n    *   If `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n    *   This simplification applies to both system_1 and system_2.\n\n3.  **Establish a Proportionality for the Mass Ratio:** The question asks for a factor, which is the ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 (`M₁ / M₂`). When forming this ratio, several terms cancel out:\n    *   The constant term `1 / (2πG)` is present in both the numerator and the denominator.\n    *   The term `sin³(i)`, which is approximately 1 for both systems, also cancels.\n    This simplifies the relationship to a direct proportionality, which is the key to solving the problem efficiently:\n    **`M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`**\n\n4.  **Extract Data and Calculate Intermediate Values:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period `P₁` = 2 years\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₁_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = **15 km/s**\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period `P₂` = 1 year\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K₂_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = **25 km/s**\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** Using the proportionality, we substitute the values:\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁_total)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_total)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15 / 25)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = **0.432**`\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **The \"Eclipsing\" Clue is Essential:** This single word is the most important piece of information outside of the numbers.

Calculating `K₁³ + K₂³` is a common mistake and would lead to a wrong answer.\n*   **Unit Cancellation:** Since the problem asks for a dimensionless ratio and the units used for each system are consistent (years for period, km/s for velocity), there is no need to convert values to a standard system like SI units. The units cancel out during the ratio calculation, simplifying the process.\n*   **Interpreting the Question:** The question asks \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2,\" which directly translates to calculating the ratio `M₁ / M₂`.
