This means the sum of their rest-mass energies is `E_final_rest = (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 0.99 * E_initial = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Ratio:** We are told the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship also applies to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving the System:** We solve this system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substitute the second equation into the first:\n    `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    This gives:\n    *   `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment)\n    *   `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment)\n*   **Careful Point:** This calculation is foundational and consistently performed correctly by all candidate solutions.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe Q-value of the reaction is the energy \"lost\" from the rest mass, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`T₁ + T₂`).\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The total kinetic energy shared between the fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives us the relationship `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   We use the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the ratio: `T₁_classical + 2*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which gives `3*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The classically calculated kinetic energy for the more massive fragment is exactly 1 GeV.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct Kinetic Energy T₁ using the Relativistic Formula**\nConservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds, but we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set their `(pc)²` terms equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and the energy conservation relation `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel each other out.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Now, we solve for the correct kinetic energy, `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This algebraic step is the most complex part of the problem. A mistake here would lead to the wrong answer. The result of 1.005 GeV is confirmed by all candidate answers that show their work.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Difference and Convert Units**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\nFinally, convert this value to MeV, knowing that `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** Ensure the final conversion to MeV is performed correctly.\n\nThe analysis robustly shows the difference is 5 MeV. Matching this to the given options:\nA) 10 MeV.\nB) 2 MeV.\nC) 5 MeV.\nD) 20 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value of 5 MeV corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating and verifying the consistent reasoning found across the candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Initial and Final State Parameters**\n\n*   **Initial State**: An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Its initial rest-mass energy is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final State**: The nucleus splits into two fragments, with rest masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n    *   **Mass Relationship**: One fragment is twice as massive. Let `m₁` be the more massive fragment, so `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n    *   **Rest-Mass Sum**: The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nThe first step is to determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments. It's most convenient to work with energy units (`E_rest = mc²`).\n*   The mass relationship `m₁ = 2m₂` translates directly to `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`. Let's call these `E_rest₁` and `E_rest₂`.\n*   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments is 99% of the initial rest-mass energy:\n    `E_final_rest = E_rest₁ + E_rest₂ = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We solve the system of two equations:\n    1. `E_rest₁ + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n    2. `E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first:\n    `(2 * E_rest₂) + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n    `3 * E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n*   This yields the rest-mass energies:\n    *   Lighter fragment: `E_rest₂ = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment: `E_rest₁ = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Careful point**: This calculation is foundational and consistently performed correctly in all detailed analyses.\n\n### **3. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from the initial rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful point**: This total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments (`T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`). This relationship is crucial for the subsequent steps.\n\n### **4. Calculation of `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the initial nucleus was at rest (`p_initial = 0`), the fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This is the key principle for distributing the kinetic energy.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy**: The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n*   Given `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio `m₂ / m₁` is 1/2. This means `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical` (the lighter fragment gets twice the kinetic energy).\n*   Using the total kinetic energy from Step 3: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the ratio: `T₁_classical + (2 * T₁_classical) = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculation of `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum**: We still use `|p₁| = |p₂|`, but with the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`, where `T` is the kinetic energy and `mc²` is the rest-mass energy.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set their `(pc)²` terms equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Now substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand both sides of the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` term on each side cancels out. Now, we group the remaining terms:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   **Careful point**: The algebra here must be precise. All candidate analyses that show work arrive at this same correct result.\n\n### **6. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the difference requested by the question and convert the units.\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Finally, convert from GeV to MeV, using the conversion factor `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculated difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is 5 MeV. Matching this to the options provided in the question:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention to the key physical principles and calculations involved. The logic below is consistent with the correct methods presented by the candidate agents.\n\n### **Analysis and Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nFirst, we must determine the individual rest-mass energies of the two fragments produced by the fission.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final Rest-Mass Energy:** The sum of the final rest-mass energies (`m₁c²` and `m₂c²`) is 99% of the initial energy.\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are told one fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship also holds for their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for Individual Energies:** We now solve the following system of two linear equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substitute the second equation into the first:\n    `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    This yields:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A common mistake would be to miscalculate the initial sum of final rest-mass energies. It's essential to correctly use the 99% figure.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nThe Q-value of the reaction is the energy that was converted from rest-mass energy into kinetic energy.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is conserved. The energy difference between the initial rest-mass and the final total rest-mass must be equal to the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments. We must now determine how it is partitioned.\n\n**3. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nFirst, we calculate the kinetic energy of the massive fragment, `T₁`, using classical mechanics.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. This requires the fragments to have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`. Given `m₁ = 2m₂`, this ratio is 1/2.\n    `T₂_classical = 2 × T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We use the total kinetic energy from Step 2:\n    `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A key result from classical mechanics is that the lighter particle always carries away more of the kinetic energy.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\nNext, we repeat the calculation for `T₁` using the equations of special relativity.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** This fundamental principle still holds: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The correct relation is `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`, where `E = T + mc²` is the total energy. This can be expressed conveniently as `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `|p₁c|² = |p₂c|²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel. Now, simplify and solve the resulting linear equation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** Careful algebraic manipulation is key to solving for `T₁` without error. The `T₁²` terms conveniently canceling is a feature of this problem's setup.\n\n**5. Find the Final Difference**\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct and the classically-approximated values and convert to the required units.\n\n*   **Difference:** `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n    `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The answer must be in MeV, and `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    `Difference = 0.005 × 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nComparing this numerical result with the provided options:\nA) 5 MeV.\nB) 2 MeV.\nC) 20 MeV.\nD) 10 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value of 5 MeV matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis using principles from both classical and relativistic mechanics. An examination of the candidate answers reveals that they all correctly follow the same physical reasoning and mathematical steps, with the only variation being the letter choice at the end, likely due to different option listings. The calculation is robustly confirmed. Here is a definitive, step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### **Careful Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nThis is the foundational step. All subsequent calculations depend on these values.\n*   **Initial State:** The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Sum of Final Rest-Mass Energies:** The problem states the sum of the fragments' rest masses (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. This means their combined rest-mass energy is `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Individual Fragment Energies:** We are given that the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice the mass of the other (`m₁ = 2m₂`), which means their rest-mass energies are related by `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`. We solve this system of equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Result:** The rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment is `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThis energy comes from the conversion of rest mass.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`.\n*   **Result:** `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`. This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical Approximation (`T₁_classical`)**\nThis requires applying conservation of momentum to the classical formula for kinetic energy.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass (`T ∝ 1/m`).\n*   **Energy Ratio:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for T₁_classical:** Using the total kinetic energy, `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`, we substitute the ratio: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Result:** `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct Kinetic Energy T₁ using the Relativistic Formula (`T₁_correct`)**\nThis step accounts for relativistic effects, which are necessary when kinetic energies are on the same order of magnitude as rest-mass energies.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The energy-momentum relation `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`, is used. Conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`) still holds, so their `(pc)²` values are equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`\n*   **Solving for T₁_correct:** We substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and the energy relation `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms cancel out from both sides. We then group the terms and solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   **Result:** `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\nThis is the final step to answer the question.\n*   **Difference:** `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The question asks for the answer in MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `Difference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy value and the value from the classical approximation is 5 MeV. Matching this to the given options:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a systematic analysis of the problem, incorporating the correct and consistent reasoning found in the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nThe first step is to figure out the individual rest-mass energies of the two fragments produced by the fission.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is given as `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State Rest Energy:** The problem states the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Ratio:** We are told one fragment is twice as massive as the other. We will define `m₁` as the more massive fragment, so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship applies directly to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`.\n*   **Solving the System:** We have two equations to solve:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substituting the second equation into the first gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    This yields:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂c²`) = **99 GeV**.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁c²`) = 2 * 99 GeV = **198 GeV**.\n\n    **Careful Point 1:** It's essential to correctly parse the problem statement to establish this system of equations for the fragment energies. The calculation itself is straightforward and was consistently performed correctly in the candidate answers.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nBy the law of conservation of energy, the energy difference between the initial rest state and the final rest state is released as kinetic energy.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    The two fragments must share a total of 3 GeV of kinetic energy.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass.\n*   **Ratio of Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂/m₁`. Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`.\n*   **Solving for T₁_classical:** We have `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`. We also know that `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`. Substituting the ratio into the sum gives:\n    `T₁_classical + (2 * T₁_classical) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n    **Careful Point 2:** In the classical approximation, the kinetic energy is split in inverse proportion to the mass, not equally. The more massive fragment gets less kinetic energy.\n\n**4. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\nThe conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`) still holds true, but we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The relationship is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate their `(pc)²` terms:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The algebra must be done carefully. Note that the `T₁²` term conveniently cancels from both sides.\n    `396T₁ = (9 + 594) + (-6 - 198)T₁`\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Final Difference**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct value (`T₁_correct`) and the value from the classical approximation (`T₁_classical`).\n\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The final step is to convert the result to the required units (MeV). `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    Difference = `0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculation robustly yields a difference of 5 MeV.

The only discrepancies arise from different option mappings (A, B, C, D). The following step-by-step breakdown verifies the correct calculation.\n\n### **Systematic Analysis**\n\n**1. Given Information & Initial Setup**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of nucleus: `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   It splits into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`. We'll define `m₁` as the more massive fragment.\n*   Mass ratio: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   Sum of final rest-mass energies: `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nThis involves solving a simple system of two equations.\n1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)` (from the mass ratio)\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n`2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n`m₂c² = 99 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment)\n\nAnd therefore:\n`m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment)\n\n**3. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nBy the conservation of energy, the difference in rest-mass energy is converted into kinetic energy.\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculation of `T₁` using Classical Approximation**\n*   **Careful Point:** Conservation of momentum requires the fragments to have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction, i.e., `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This holds true for both classical and relativistic cases.\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Substituting into the total kinetic energy equation:\n    `T₁_classical + (2 * T₁_classical) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculation of Correct Relativistic `T₁`**\n*   We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate their `(pc)²` terms:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`\n*   **Careful Point:** All energies must be in consistent units. Using GeV throughout is best. We substitute `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation conveniently cancel out, simplifying the problem from a quadratic to a linear equation.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Now, solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference and Final Conversion**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\nFinally, convert this value from GeV to MeV, knowing that `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated difference is **5 MeV**. Comparing this to the provided list of options:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 20 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a systematic analysis of the problem, incorporating and verifying the logic from the candidate answers to arrive at a definitive solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n**1. Define Parameters and Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nThe first step is to use the information given to find the individual rest-mass energies of the two fission fragments.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`. The nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into a more massive fragment (`m₁`) and a less massive one (`m₂`).\n*   **Key Information:**\n    1.  Mass ratio: `m₁ = 2m₂`. This translates directly to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n    2.  Sum of final rest-mass energies: `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * E_initial`.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Sum of final energies = `0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   We now solve the system of two equations:\n        *   `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n        *   `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    *   Substituting the second equation into the first gives: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Solving for the individual rest-mass energies:\n        *   Lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n        *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nBy the law of conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from the initial rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   The two fragments share a total of 3 GeV of kinetic energy.\n\n**3. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂/m₁ = 1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We use the total kinetic energy relationship `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`. Substituting the ratio gives: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which results in `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   The classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct `T₁` using Relativistic Mechanics**\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** We still rely on the conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`), but we use the correct relativistic formula connecting kinetic energy (`T`), rest-mass energy (`mc²`), and momentum (`p`): `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set their `(pc)²` values equal to each other:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** We substitute all the known values (energies in GeV): `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expanding both sides of the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   A key feature of this calculation is that the `T₁²` terms cancel out, simplifying the problem to a linear equation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Now, we solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This is the correct, relativistic value for `T₁`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to Final Units**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Finally, we convert this to MeV using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis consistently shows that all candidate agents who provided a detailed breakdown correctly applied the physical principles and performed the necessary calculations, arriving at a final numerical answer of **5 MeV**.

The slight variations in the final letter choices are due to differing option lists presented to each agent. The following is a consolidated, step-by-step verification of the calculation with key points highlighted.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis with Careful Points**\n\n**Step 1: Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nThe first step is to calculate the individual rest-mass energies of the two fission fragments.\n*   Initial rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The total final rest-mass energy is 99% of this: `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   The more massive fragment (`m₁`) has twice the mass of the lighter one (`m₂`), so their rest-mass energies are related by `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   Solving the system of equations `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297` and `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)` gives:\n    *   `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV` -> `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (lighter fragment).\n    *   `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (more massive fragment).\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly assign the calculated energies. `T₁` is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which has a rest-mass energy of `198 GeV`. All calculations should be kept in a consistent unit (GeV) until the final step.\n\n---\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\nThe energy \"lost\" from the rest mass of the system is converted into the kinetic energy (`Q`) of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This `Q`-value of 3 GeV represents the *total* kinetic energy shared between the two fragments. It is not the kinetic energy of a single fragment.\n\n---\n**Step 3: Calculate the Classical Kinetic Energy (`T₁,classical`)**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude (`p`) and opposite direction.\n*   The classical kinetic energy formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁,classical / T₂,classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy, `T₁,classical + T₂,classical = 3 GeV`, and substituting `T₂,classical = 2 * T₁,classical`, we get:\n    `T₁,classical + 2T₁,classical = 3 GeV` -> `3T₁,classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This result is an approximation. The problem requires finding the difference between this value and the more accurate relativistic one.\n\n---\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct Relativistic Kinetic Energy (`T₁,correct`)**\nThe principle of momentum conservation still applies (`|p₁| = |p₂|`), but we must use the correct relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n*   The relation is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate their `(pc)²` expressions:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand and simplify:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\n**Careful Point:** The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation conveniently cancel out, simplifying the problem from a quadratic to a linear equation.\n*   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n*   `600T₁ = 603`\n*   `T₁,correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n---\n**Step 5: Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct and classical values and convert the units.\n*   Difference = `T₁,correct - T₁,classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV. Matching this to the options provided:\nA) 5 MeV.\nB) 20 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 10 MeV.\n\nThe result corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the correct and consistent reasoning found in the candidate answers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe problem requires us to find the difference between the kinetic energy of a fission fragment calculated using relativistic mechanics versus classical mechanics. This involves applying principles of conservation of energy and momentum in both frameworks. An analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the methodology and numerical result; the variation in final lettered choices is due to different option lists being presented. The following is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments.**\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The fission results in two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`. We are given that one is twice as massive, so we define `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass. This translates to the sum of their rest-mass energies:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * E_initial = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first gives: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving this gives the rest-mass energies of the two fragments:\n    *   Lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-Value).**\n\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, the \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    `Q = T_total = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Calculate the kinetic energy T₁ using the classical approximation (`T₁_classical`).**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, its momentum was zero. The two fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This principle is crucial and applies to both classical and relativistic calculations.\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. For a constant momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass (`T ∝ 1/m`).\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives the relationship `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the relationship: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This yields `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Calculate the correct relativistic kinetic energy T₁ (`T₁_correct`).**\n\n*   The conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds.\n*   The correct relativistic relationship between kinetic energy (`T`), rest-mass energy (`mc²`), and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum values `p` are equal, we can set the `(pc)²` expressions for both fragments equal to each other:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`\n*   Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand both sides of the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   A key simplification occurs as the `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out, leaving a linear equation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Find the final difference and convert to the correct units.**\n\n*   The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n    Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n    Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The final answer must be in units of MeV. Using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV. Matching this to the provided list of options:\nA) 10 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 20 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAn analysis of the fifteen provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the correct physical principles and mathematical procedure. All solutions that show detailed steps arrive at the same numerical result. The only discrepancies are in the final lettered choice, which suggests the agents were given different option lists. The task is to perform a definitive, step-by-step verification of the calculation and map the result to the options provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State Rest Energy:** The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. This means their combined rest-mass energy is `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Individual Energies:** We are given that the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice the mass of the other (`m₁ = 2m₂`), which implies their rest-mass energies are related in the same way: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving the system:**\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substitute the second equation into the first: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`. This simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\n\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from the rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** As the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** Using `T = p² / (2m)`, the ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of the masses: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** Using the total kinetic energy `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`, we substitute the ratio: `T₁_classical + 2*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This gives `3*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The momenta are still equal (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`). The correct relativistic relationship is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p` is the same for both, we set their `(pc)²` terms equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** We substitute the known values (in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expanding the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We simplify and solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This is the correct, relativistic value for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\n\n*   The difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n    `Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The question requires the answer in MeV. Using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points in the Analysis**\n*   **Fragment Identification:** It is crucial to correctly associate `T₁` with the more massive fragment (`m₁`), whose rest-mass energy is 198 GeV, not 99 GeV.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** Energy conservation provides the total kinetic energy released (3 GeV), while momentum conservation provides the relationship between the two fragments' individual energies.\n*   **Formula Selection:** One must be careful to use the classical kinetic energy formula (`T=p²/2m`) only for the approximation, and the relativistic formula (`(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`) for the correct value.\n*   **Algebraic Precision:** The algebraic manipulation in Step 4 is the most complex part of the calculation and requires careful execution to avoid errors.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The final step of converting from GeV to MeV is critical. The difference is small (`0.005` GeV), making an order-of-magnitude error possible if the conversion factor (`1000`) is misapplied.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe calculation robustly shows the difference between the correct and classical values for T1 is **5 MeV**.

The candidate answers show a remarkable consensus on the calculation process, which is verified below.\n\n**1. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nThis is the foundational step. All subsequent calculations depend on getting these values correct.\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus: `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The problem states the sum of the fragments' rest masses (`m₁`, `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. This translates directly to their rest-mass energies:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   The mass ratio is given as `m₁ = 2m₂`, so `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   We solve this system of equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting (2) into (1) gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   This yields the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   **Less massive fragment:** `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n    *   **More massive fragment:** `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nBy conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy (`T₁ + T₂`) of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T_classical = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1 / 2`. Thus, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We use the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`. Substituting the ratio gives `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which results in:\n    *   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct Relativistic Formula**\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds. The relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy (`T`), and rest-mass energy (`mc²`) is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set their `(pc)²` terms equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** We substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and the energy conservation relation `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel out, greatly simplifying the problem:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solving for `T₁`:\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   Finally, we convert this to MeV, using `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    *   Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`\n\n### **Careful Points**\n1.  **Rest-Mass Energy vs. Total Energy:** It's crucial to distinguish between the rest-mass energy (`mc²`) and the total energy (`T + mc²`). The problem gives initial and final sums in terms of rest mass.\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The fact that `|p₁| = |p₂|` is the linchpin that allows for solving the problem in both the classical and relativistic cases.\n3.  **Relativistic Formula:** The correct relativistic relation `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`, derived from `E_total² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, must be used.\n4.  **Unit Conversion:** The final answer must be converted from GeV to MeV as requested by the format of the options.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe calculation robustly yields a difference of **5 MeV**.

This implies a corresponding ratio for their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   We solve the following system of equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting (2) into (1): `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV` -> `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   This gives the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   Lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n*   The Q-value is the energy released during the reaction, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`T₁ + T₂`). It is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum** is the key principle. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   Therefore, the ratio of kinetic energies is: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives us the relationship `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the ratio: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV` -> `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Thus, the classically calculated kinetic energy is `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Calculate the Correct T₁ using the Relativistic Formula**\n*   We still use the conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`).\n*   The **relativistic relationship** between kinetic energy `T`, rest-mass energy `mc²`, and momentum `p` is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum values are equal, their squared values are also equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand and solve the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms conveniently cancel out from both sides:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solving the resulting linear equation for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This is the correct, relativistic kinetic energy.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Find the Difference and Convert Units**\n*   The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The final step is to convert this value to MeV, using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV × 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation robustly yields a difference of **5 MeV**.

The core calculation is therefore highly reliable.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the definitive solution, incorporating careful points to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the two final fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of this initial value:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let `m₁` be the more massive fragment, so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship also applies to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`.\n*   We solve the system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`\n    Substituting (2) into (1) gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving this gives the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   Lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Careful point:** It is crucial to use energy units (GeV) consistently throughout the calculation to avoid unnecessary conversions involving mass.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from the rest mass of the system is converted into the total kinetic energy (`Q`) of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful point:** This Q-value of 3 GeV is the total kinetic energy that is shared between the two fragments.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical Approximation (`T₁_classical`)**\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the law of conservation of momentum dictates that the final fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   In classical (non-relativistic) mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   This means the ratio of kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of the masses: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1 / 2`.\n*   Thus, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Substituting this into the total kinetic energy equation (`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`) gives `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Solving yields `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct Relativistic `T₁` (`T₁_correct`)**\n*   Conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still applies.\n*   The correct relativistic relationship between kinetic energy (`T`), rest-mass energy (`mc²`), and momentum (`p`) is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²` for both fragments:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute our known values (in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful point:** A key simplification occurs here as the `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel each other out, leaving a linear equation.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solving for `T₁`:\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Final Difference**\n*   The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Careful point:** The final step is to convert this result from GeV to MeV, as requested by the options.

Therefore, the task is to verify the universally agreed-upon calculation and map it to the specific option list given in the problem statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe solution to the problem can be broken down into five distinct steps.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fission Fragments.**\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. This means the sum of their rest-mass energies (`E_rest₁` and `E_rest₂`) is `E_rest_total = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other (`m₁ = 2m₂`), which implies their rest-mass energies have the same ratio: `E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`.\n*   We can solve this system of two equations:\n    1.  `E_rest₁ + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first gives: `2*E_rest₂ + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`, which yields `3*E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving gives `E_rest₂ = 99 GeV` (for the lighter fragment) and `E_rest₁ = 198 GeV` (for the more massive fragment).\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value).**\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from the rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`Q`).\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_rest_total = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Calculate the Kinetic Energy `T₁` using the Classical Approximation.**\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass for a fixed momentum.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This means `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`. Using the total kinetic energy `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`, we substitute to get `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This simplifies to `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Calculate the Correct Relativistic Kinetic Energy `T₁`.**\n*   The conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`) still holds.

The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass.\n    *   **Calculation:** The total rest-mass energy of the two fragments is `E_final_rest = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   **Given:** The mass ratio is `m₁ = 2m₂`. This directly implies their rest-mass energies have the same ratio: `E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`.\n    *   **System of Equations:**\n        1.  `E_rest₁ + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n        2.  `E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`\n    *   **Solution:** Substituting (2) into (1) gives `3 * E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`, which means the rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment is `E_rest₂ = 99 GeV`, and the more massive fragment is `E_rest₁ = 198 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly calculate the total final rest energy and then solve the system of equations without error. All candidate answers performed this correctly.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value):**\n    *   **Principle:** By conservation of total energy, the energy \"lost\" from rest-mass is converted into the kinetic energy (`Q`) of the fragments.\n    *   **Calculation:** `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This `Q` value represents the *total* kinetic energy that must be shared between the two fragments.\n\n3.  **Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:**\n    *   **Principle:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n    *   **Formula:** The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n    *   **Ratio:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1 / 2`.\n    *   **Solution:** We combine this ratio (`T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`) with the total kinetic energy (`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`). This gives `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This value is an approximation. The key is correctly establishing the inverse relationship between kinetic energy and mass under the classical assumption.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Correct Relativistic T₁:**\n    *   **Principle:** Momentum is still conserved (`|p₁| = |p₂|`), but we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n    *   **Equation:** Since the momenta are equal, we can set `(p₁c)²` equal to `(p₂c)²`:\n        `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n    *   **Solution:** Substitute the known values (in GeV): `m₁c²=198`, `m₂c²=99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n        `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n        `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    *   **Careful Point:** The `T₁²` terms cancel out, simplifying the problem significantly.

All discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to the agents being presented with different orderings of the options.\n\nThe following is a definitive, step-by-step analysis that synthesizes the correct logic and highlights critical points to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nThis is the foundational step upon which all other calculations rely.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass.\n    *   Mass ratio of fragments: `m₁ = 2m₂`, where `m₁` is the more massive fragment.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  First, calculate the total rest-mass energy of the final fragments:\n        `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    2.  Now, solve the system of two equations:\n        *   `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n        *   `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    3.  Substituting the second equation into the first gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    4.  This yields the individual rest-mass energies:\n        *   Lighter fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n        *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is essential to correctly calculate the total final rest energy (297 GeV) and then correctly assign the calculated energies to the respective fragments. `m₁` corresponds to 198 GeV.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nBy the law of conservation of energy, the energy difference between the initial and final rest states is released as kinetic energy.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This `Q`-value of 3 GeV represents the *total* kinetic energy shared between the two fragments. It must be partitioned between them in the subsequent steps.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude (`p`) and opposite direction.\n\n*   The classical kinetic energy formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This gives `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy from Step 2 (`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`) and substituting the ratio, we get: `T₁_classical + 2*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which yields `3*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A common mistake would be to split the energy equally. In classical mechanics, the lighter fragment always receives a larger share of the kinetic energy.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct T₁ using the Relativistic Formula**\nThe conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`) still holds, but we must use the correct relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n*   The relationship is `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate their `(pc)²` terms:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The algebra must be performed meticulously. A key simplification occurs when the `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out, leaving a linear equation.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Difference and Convert to Final Units**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the value from the classical approximation.\n\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The final step is to convert the result to MeV as requested by the options. Using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated difference is **5 MeV**. Comparing this to the provided options in the question:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 20 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value of 5 MeV matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

This means the sum of their rest-mass energies is `E_final_rest = (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 0.99 * E_initial = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Ratio:** We are told the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship also applies to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving the System:** We solve this system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substitute the second equation into the first:\n    `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    This gives:\n    *   `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment)\n    *   `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment)\n*   **Careful Point:** This calculation is foundational and consistently performed correctly by all candidate solutions.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe Q-value of the reaction is the energy \"lost\" from the rest mass, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`T₁ + T₂`).\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The total kinetic energy shared between the fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives us the relationship `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   We use the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the ratio: `T₁_classical + 2*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which gives `3*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The classically calculated kinetic energy for the more massive fragment is exactly 1 GeV.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct Kinetic Energy T₁ using the Relativistic Formula**\nConservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds, but we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set their `(pc)²` terms equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and the energy conservation relation `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel each other out.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Now, we solve for the correct kinetic energy, `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This algebraic step is the most complex part of the problem. A mistake here would lead to the wrong answer. The result of 1.005 GeV is confirmed by all candidate answers that show their work.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Difference and Convert Units**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\nFinally, convert this value to MeV, knowing that `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** Ensure the final conversion to MeV is performed correctly.\n\nThe analysis robustly shows the difference is 5 MeV. Matching this to the given options:\nA) 10 MeV.\nB) 2 MeV.\nC) 5 MeV.\nD) 20 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value of 5 MeV corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating and verifying the consistent reasoning found across the candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Initial and Final State Parameters**\n\n*   **Initial State**: An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Its initial rest-mass energy is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final State**: The nucleus splits into two fragments, with rest masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n    *   **Mass Relationship**: One fragment is twice as massive. Let `m₁` be the more massive fragment, so `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n    *   **Rest-Mass Sum**: The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nThe first step is to determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments. It's most convenient to work with energy units (`E_rest = mc²`).\n*   The mass relationship `m₁ = 2m₂` translates directly to `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`. Let's call these `E_rest₁` and `E_rest₂`.\n*   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments is 99% of the initial rest-mass energy:\n    `E_final_rest = E_rest₁ + E_rest₂ = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We solve the system of two equations:\n    1. `E_rest₁ + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n    2. `E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first:\n    `(2 * E_rest₂) + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n    `3 * E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n*   This yields the rest-mass energies:\n    *   Lighter fragment: `E_rest₂ = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment: `E_rest₁ = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Careful point**: This calculation is foundational and consistently performed correctly in all detailed analyses.\n\n### **3. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from the initial rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful point**: This total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments (`T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`). This relationship is crucial for the subsequent steps.\n\n### **4. Calculation of `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the initial nucleus was at rest (`p_initial = 0`), the fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This is the key principle for distributing the kinetic energy.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy**: The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n*   Given `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio `m₂ / m₁` is 1/2. This means `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical` (the lighter fragment gets twice the kinetic energy).\n*   Using the total kinetic energy from Step 3: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the ratio: `T₁_classical + (2 * T₁_classical) = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculation of `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum**: We still use `|p₁| = |p₂|`, but with the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`, where `T` is the kinetic energy and `mc²` is the rest-mass energy.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set their `(pc)²` terms equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Now substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand both sides of the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` term on each side cancels out. Now, we group the remaining terms:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   **Careful point**: The algebra here must be precise. All candidate analyses that show work arrive at this same correct result.\n\n### **6. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the difference requested by the question and convert the units.\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Finally, convert from GeV to MeV, using the conversion factor `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculated difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is 5 MeV. Matching this to the options provided in the question:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention to the key physical principles and calculations involved. The logic below is consistent with the correct methods presented by the candidate agents.\n\n### **Analysis and Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nFirst, we must determine the individual rest-mass energies of the two fragments produced by the fission.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final Rest-Mass Energy:** The sum of the final rest-mass energies (`m₁c²` and `m₂c²`) is 99% of the initial energy.\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 × 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are told one fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship also holds for their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for Individual Energies:** We now solve the following system of two linear equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substitute the second equation into the first:\n    `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    This yields:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A common mistake would be to miscalculate the initial sum of final rest-mass energies. It's essential to correctly use the 99% figure.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nThe Q-value of the reaction is the energy that was converted from rest-mass energy into kinetic energy.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is conserved. The energy difference between the initial rest-mass and the final total rest-mass must be equal to the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments. We must now determine how it is partitioned.\n\n**3. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nFirst, we calculate the kinetic energy of the massive fragment, `T₁`, using classical mechanics.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. This requires the fragments to have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`. Given `m₁ = 2m₂`, this ratio is 1/2.\n    `T₂_classical = 2 × T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We use the total kinetic energy from Step 2:\n    `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A key result from classical mechanics is that the lighter particle always carries away more of the kinetic energy.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\nNext, we repeat the calculation for `T₁` using the equations of special relativity.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** This fundamental principle still holds: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The correct relation is `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`, where `E = T + mc²` is the total energy. This can be expressed conveniently as `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `|p₁c|² = |p₂c|²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel. Now, simplify and solve the resulting linear equation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** Careful algebraic manipulation is key to solving for `T₁` without error. The `T₁²` terms conveniently canceling is a feature of this problem's setup.\n\n**5. Find the Final Difference**\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct and the classically-approximated values and convert to the required units.\n\n*   **Difference:** `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n    `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The answer must be in MeV, and `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    `Difference = 0.005 × 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nComparing this numerical result with the provided options:\nA) 5 MeV.\nB) 2 MeV.\nC) 20 MeV.\nD) 10 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value of 5 MeV matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis using principles from both classical and relativistic mechanics. An examination of the candidate answers reveals that they all correctly follow the same physical reasoning and mathematical steps, with the only variation being the letter choice at the end, likely due to different option listings. The calculation is robustly confirmed. Here is a definitive, step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### **Careful Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nThis is the foundational step. All subsequent calculations depend on these values.\n*   **Initial State:** The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Sum of Final Rest-Mass Energies:** The problem states the sum of the fragments' rest masses (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. This means their combined rest-mass energy is `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Individual Fragment Energies:** We are given that the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice the mass of the other (`m₁ = 2m₂`), which means their rest-mass energies are related by `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`. We solve this system of equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Result:** The rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment is `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThis energy comes from the conversion of rest mass.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`.\n*   **Result:** `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`. This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical Approximation (`T₁_classical`)**\nThis requires applying conservation of momentum to the classical formula for kinetic energy.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass (`T ∝ 1/m`).\n*   **Energy Ratio:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for T₁_classical:** Using the total kinetic energy, `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`, we substitute the ratio: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Result:** `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct Kinetic Energy T₁ using the Relativistic Formula (`T₁_correct`)**\nThis step accounts for relativistic effects, which are necessary when kinetic energies are on the same order of magnitude as rest-mass energies.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The energy-momentum relation `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`, is used. Conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`) still holds, so their `(pc)²` values are equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`\n*   **Solving for T₁_correct:** We substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and the energy relation `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms cancel out from both sides. We then group the terms and solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   **Result:** `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\nThis is the final step to answer the question.\n*   **Difference:** `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The question asks for the answer in MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `Difference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy value and the value from the classical approximation is 5 MeV. Matching this to the given options:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a systematic analysis of the problem, incorporating the correct and consistent reasoning found in the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nThe first step is to figure out the individual rest-mass energies of the two fragments produced by the fission.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is given as `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State Rest Energy:** The problem states the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Ratio:** We are told one fragment is twice as massive as the other. We will define `m₁` as the more massive fragment, so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship applies directly to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`.\n*   **Solving the System:** We have two equations to solve:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substituting the second equation into the first gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    This yields:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂c²`) = **99 GeV**.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁c²`) = 2 * 99 GeV = **198 GeV**.\n\n    **Careful Point 1:** It's essential to correctly parse the problem statement to establish this system of equations for the fragment energies. The calculation itself is straightforward and was consistently performed correctly in the candidate answers.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nBy the law of conservation of energy, the energy difference between the initial rest state and the final rest state is released as kinetic energy.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    The two fragments must share a total of 3 GeV of kinetic energy.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass.\n*   **Ratio of Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂/m₁`. Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`.\n*   **Solving for T₁_classical:** We have `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`. We also know that `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`. Substituting the ratio into the sum gives:\n    `T₁_classical + (2 * T₁_classical) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n    **Careful Point 2:** In the classical approximation, the kinetic energy is split in inverse proportion to the mass, not equally. The more massive fragment gets less kinetic energy.\n\n**4. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\nThe conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`) still holds true, but we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The relationship is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate their `(pc)²` terms:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The algebra must be done carefully. Note that the `T₁²` term conveniently cancels from both sides.\n    `396T₁ = (9 + 594) + (-6 - 198)T₁`\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Final Difference**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct value (`T₁_correct`) and the value from the classical approximation (`T₁_classical`).\n\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The final step is to convert the result to the required units (MeV). `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    Difference = `0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculation robustly yields a difference of 5 MeV. Matching this to the options provided:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nThe result of 5 MeV corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on an analysis of the provided solutions, there is a clear and strong consensus on the physical principles, mathematical steps, and the final numerical result. The only discrepancies arise from different option mappings (A, B, C, D). The following step-by-step breakdown verifies the correct calculation.\n\n### **Systematic Analysis**\n\n**1. Given Information & Initial Setup**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of nucleus: `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   It splits into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`. We'll define `m₁` as the more massive fragment.\n*   Mass ratio: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   Sum of final rest-mass energies: `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nThis involves solving a simple system of two equations.\n1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)` (from the mass ratio)\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n`2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n`m₂c² = 99 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment)\n\nAnd therefore:\n`m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment)\n\n**3. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nBy the conservation of energy, the difference in rest-mass energy is converted into kinetic energy.\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculation of `T₁` using Classical Approximation**\n*   **Careful Point:** Conservation of momentum requires the fragments to have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction, i.e., `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This holds true for both classical and relativistic cases.\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Substituting into the total kinetic energy equation:\n    `T₁_classical + (2 * T₁_classical) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculation of Correct Relativistic `T₁`**\n*   We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate their `(pc)²` terms:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`\n*   **Careful Point:** All energies must be in consistent units. Using GeV throughout is best. We substitute `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation conveniently cancel out, simplifying the problem from a quadratic to a linear equation.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Now, solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference and Final Conversion**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\nFinally, convert this value from GeV to MeV, knowing that `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated difference is **5 MeV**. Comparing this to the provided list of options:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 20 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a systematic analysis of the problem, incorporating and verifying the logic from the candidate answers to arrive at a definitive solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n**1. Define Parameters and Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nThe first step is to use the information given to find the individual rest-mass energies of the two fission fragments.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`. The nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into a more massive fragment (`m₁`) and a less massive one (`m₂`).\n*   **Key Information:**\n    1.  Mass ratio: `m₁ = 2m₂`. This translates directly to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n    2.  Sum of final rest-mass energies: `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * E_initial`.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Sum of final energies = `0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   We now solve the system of two equations:\n        *   `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n        *   `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    *   Substituting the second equation into the first gives: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Solving for the individual rest-mass energies:\n        *   Lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n        *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nBy the law of conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from the initial rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   The two fragments share a total of 3 GeV of kinetic energy.\n\n**3. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂/m₁ = 1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We use the total kinetic energy relationship `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`. Substituting the ratio gives: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which results in `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   The classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct `T₁` using Relativistic Mechanics**\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** We still rely on the conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`), but we use the correct relativistic formula connecting kinetic energy (`T`), rest-mass energy (`mc²`), and momentum (`p`): `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set their `(pc)²` values equal to each other:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** We substitute all the known values (energies in GeV): `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expanding both sides of the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   A key feature of this calculation is that the `T₁²` terms cancel out, simplifying the problem to a linear equation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Now, we solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This is the correct, relativistic value for `T₁`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to Final Units**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Finally, we convert this to MeV using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis consistently shows that all candidate agents who provided a detailed breakdown correctly applied the physical principles and performed the necessary calculations, arriving at a final numerical answer of **5 MeV**.

The slight variations in the final letter choices are due to differing option lists presented to each agent. The following is a consolidated, step-by-step verification of the calculation with key points highlighted.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis with Careful Points**\n\n**Step 1: Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nThe first step is to calculate the individual rest-mass energies of the two fission fragments.\n*   Initial rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The total final rest-mass energy is 99% of this: `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   The more massive fragment (`m₁`) has twice the mass of the lighter one (`m₂`), so their rest-mass energies are related by `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   Solving the system of equations `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297` and `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)` gives:\n    *   `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV` -> `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (lighter fragment).\n    *   `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (more massive fragment).\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly assign the calculated energies. `T₁` is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which has a rest-mass energy of `198 GeV`. All calculations should be kept in a consistent unit (GeV) until the final step.\n\n---\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\nThe energy \"lost\" from the rest mass of the system is converted into the kinetic energy (`Q`) of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This `Q`-value of 3 GeV represents the *total* kinetic energy shared between the two fragments. It is not the kinetic energy of a single fragment.\n\n---\n**Step 3: Calculate the Classical Kinetic Energy (`T₁,classical`)**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude (`p`) and opposite direction.\n*   The classical kinetic energy formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁,classical / T₂,classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy, `T₁,classical + T₂,classical = 3 GeV`, and substituting `T₂,classical = 2 * T₁,classical`, we get:\n    `T₁,classical + 2T₁,classical = 3 GeV` -> `3T₁,classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This result is an approximation. The problem requires finding the difference between this value and the more accurate relativistic one.\n\n---\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct Relativistic Kinetic Energy (`T₁,correct`)**\nThe principle of momentum conservation still applies (`|p₁| = |p₂|`), but we must use the correct relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n*   The relation is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate their `(pc)²` expressions:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand and simplify:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\n**Careful Point:** The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation conveniently cancel out, simplifying the problem from a quadratic to a linear equation.\n*   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n*   `600T₁ = 603`\n*   `T₁,correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n---\n**Step 5: Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct and classical values and convert the units.\n*   Difference = `T₁,correct - T₁,classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV.

This involves applying principles of conservation of energy and momentum in both frameworks. An analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the methodology and numerical result; the variation in final lettered choices is due to different option lists being presented. The following is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments.**\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The fission results in two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`. We are given that one is twice as massive, so we define `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass. This translates to the sum of their rest-mass energies:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * E_initial = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first gives: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving this gives the rest-mass energies of the two fragments:\n    *   Lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-Value).**\n\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, the \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    `Q = T_total = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Calculate the kinetic energy T₁ using the classical approximation (`T₁_classical`).**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, its momentum was zero. The two fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This principle is crucial and applies to both classical and relativistic calculations.\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. For a constant momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass (`T ∝ 1/m`).\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives the relationship `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the relationship: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This yields `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Calculate the correct relativistic kinetic energy T₁ (`T₁_correct`).**\n\n*   The conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds.\n*   The correct relativistic relationship between kinetic energy (`T`), rest-mass energy (`mc²`), and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum values `p` are equal, we can set the `(pc)²` expressions for both fragments equal to each other:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`\n*   Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand both sides of the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   A key simplification occurs as the `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out, leaving a linear equation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Find the final difference and convert to the correct units.**\n\n*   The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n    Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n    Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The final answer must be in units of MeV.

The task is to perform a definitive, step-by-step verification of the calculation and map the result to the options provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State Rest Energy:** The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. This means their combined rest-mass energy is `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Individual Energies:** We are given that the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice the mass of the other (`m₁ = 2m₂`), which implies their rest-mass energies are related in the same way: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving the system:**\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    Substitute the second equation into the first: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`. This simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\n\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from the rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** As the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** Using `T = p² / (2m)`, the ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of the masses: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** Using the total kinetic energy `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`, we substitute the ratio: `T₁_classical + 2*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This gives `3*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The momenta are still equal (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`). The correct relativistic relationship is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p` is the same for both, we set their `(pc)²` terms equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** We substitute the known values (in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expanding the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We simplify and solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This is the correct, relativistic value for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\n\n*   The difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n    `Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The question requires the answer in MeV. Using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points in the Analysis**\n*   **Fragment Identification:** It is crucial to correctly associate `T₁` with the more massive fragment (`m₁`), whose rest-mass energy is 198 GeV, not 99 GeV.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** Energy conservation provides the total kinetic energy released (3 GeV), while momentum conservation provides the relationship between the two fragments' individual energies.\n*   **Formula Selection:** One must be careful to use the classical kinetic energy formula (`T=p²/2m`) only for the approximation, and the relativistic formula (`(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`) for the correct value.\n*   **Algebraic Precision:** The algebraic manipulation in Step 4 is the most complex part of the calculation and requires careful execution to avoid errors.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The final step of converting from GeV to MeV is critical. The difference is small (`0.005` GeV), making an order-of-magnitude error possible if the conversion factor (`1000`) is misapplied.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe calculation robustly shows the difference between the correct and classical values for T1 is **5 MeV**. Comparing this to the provided options:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating and verifying the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem asks for the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1`) calculated using correct relativistic formulas and the same value calculated using classical approximations. The candidate answers show a remarkable consensus on the calculation process, which is verified below.\n\n**1. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nThis is the foundational step. All subsequent calculations depend on getting these values correct.\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus: `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The problem states the sum of the fragments' rest masses (`m₁`, `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. This translates directly to their rest-mass energies:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   The mass ratio is given as `m₁ = 2m₂`, so `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   We solve this system of equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting (2) into (1) gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   This yields the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   **Less massive fragment:** `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n    *   **More massive fragment:** `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\nBy conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy (`T₁ + T₂`) of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T_classical = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1 / 2`. Thus, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We use the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`. Substituting the ratio gives `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which results in:\n    *   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct Relativistic Formula**\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still holds. The relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy (`T`), and rest-mass energy (`mc²`) is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set their `(pc)²` terms equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** We substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and the energy conservation relation `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel out, greatly simplifying the problem:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solving for `T₁`:\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   Finally, we convert this to MeV, using `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    *   Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`\n\n### **Careful Points**\n1.  **Rest-Mass Energy vs. Total Energy:** It's crucial to distinguish between the rest-mass energy (`mc²`) and the total energy (`T + mc²`). The problem gives initial and final sums in terms of rest mass.\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The fact that `|p₁| = |p₂|` is the linchpin that allows for solving the problem in both the classical and relativistic cases.\n3.  **Relativistic Formula:** The correct relativistic relation `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`, derived from `E_total² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, must be used.\n4.  **Unit Conversion:** The final answer must be converted from GeV to MeV as requested by the format of the options.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe calculation robustly yields a difference of **5 MeV**.

This implies a corresponding ratio for their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   We solve the following system of equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting (2) into (1): `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV` -> `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   This gives the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   Lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 × 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n*   The Q-value is the energy released during the reaction, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`T₁ + T₂`). It is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum** is the key principle. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   Therefore, the ratio of kinetic energies is: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives us the relationship `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy from Step 2: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the ratio: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV` -> `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Thus, the classically calculated kinetic energy is `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Calculate the Correct T₁ using the Relativistic Formula**\n*   We still use the conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`).\n*   The **relativistic relationship** between kinetic energy `T`, rest-mass energy `mc²`, and momentum `p` is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum values are equal, their squared values are also equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand and solve the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms conveniently cancel out from both sides:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solving the resulting linear equation for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This is the correct, relativistic kinetic energy.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Find the Difference and Convert Units**\n*   The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The final step is to convert this value to MeV, using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV × 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation robustly yields a difference of **5 MeV**.

The core calculation is therefore highly reliable.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the definitive solution, incorporating careful points to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the two final fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of this initial value:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let `m₁` be the more massive fragment, so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This relationship also applies to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`.\n*   We solve the system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`\n    Substituting (2) into (1) gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving this gives the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   Lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Careful point:** It is crucial to use energy units (GeV) consistently throughout the calculation to avoid unnecessary conversions involving mass.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from the rest mass of the system is converted into the total kinetic energy (`Q`) of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful point:** This Q-value of 3 GeV is the total kinetic energy that is shared between the two fragments.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical Approximation (`T₁_classical`)**\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the law of conservation of momentum dictates that the final fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   In classical (non-relativistic) mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   This means the ratio of kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of the masses: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1 / 2`.\n*   Thus, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Substituting this into the total kinetic energy equation (`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`) gives `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Solving yields `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct Relativistic `T₁` (`T₁_correct`)**\n*   Conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) still applies.\n*   The correct relativistic relationship between kinetic energy (`T`), rest-mass energy (`mc²`), and momentum (`p`) is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²` for both fragments:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute our known values (in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful point:** A key simplification occurs here as the `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel each other out, leaving a linear equation.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solving for `T₁`:\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Final Difference**\n*   The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Careful point:** The final step is to convert this result from GeV to MeV, as requested by the options.

Therefore, the task is to verify the universally agreed-upon calculation and map it to the specific option list given in the problem statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe solution to the problem can be broken down into five distinct steps.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fission Fragments.**\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. This means the sum of their rest-mass energies (`E_rest₁` and `E_rest₂`) is `E_rest_total = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other (`m₁ = 2m₂`), which implies their rest-mass energies have the same ratio: `E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`.\n*   We can solve this system of two equations:\n    1.  `E_rest₁ + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first gives: `2*E_rest₂ + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`, which yields `3*E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving gives `E_rest₂ = 99 GeV` (for the lighter fragment) and `E_rest₁ = 198 GeV` (for the more massive fragment).\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value).**\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from the rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`Q`).\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_rest_total = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Calculate the Kinetic Energy `T₁` using the Classical Approximation.**\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass for a fixed momentum.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This means `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`. Using the total kinetic energy `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`, we substitute to get `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This simplifies to `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Calculate the Correct Relativistic Kinetic Energy `T₁`.**\n*   The conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`) still holds. The relativistic relationship between kinetic energy, rest-mass energy, and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments, we can set their `(pc)²` values equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (with all energies in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` term cancels from both sides. We then solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Find the Final Difference and Convert Units.**\n*   The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The answer must be in MeV. Using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `Difference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV.

The calculations are verified below, with attention to the careful points required at each step.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   **Given:** The initial rest-mass energy is `E_initial = 300 GeV`. The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass.\n    *   **Calculation:** The total rest-mass energy of the two fragments is `E_final_rest = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   **Given:** The mass ratio is `m₁ = 2m₂`. This directly implies their rest-mass energies have the same ratio: `E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`.\n    *   **System of Equations:**\n        1.  `E_rest₁ + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n        2.  `E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`\n    *   **Solution:** Substituting (2) into (1) gives `3 * E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`, which means the rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment is `E_rest₂ = 99 GeV`, and the more massive fragment is `E_rest₁ = 198 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly calculate the total final rest energy and then solve the system of equations without error. All candidate answers performed this correctly.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value):**\n    *   **Principle:** By conservation of total energy, the energy \"lost\" from rest-mass is converted into the kinetic energy (`Q`) of the fragments.\n    *   **Calculation:** `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This `Q` value represents the *total* kinetic energy that must be shared between the two fragments.\n\n3.  **Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:**\n    *   **Principle:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n    *   **Formula:** The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n    *   **Ratio:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1 / 2`.\n    *   **Solution:** We combine this ratio (`T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`) with the total kinetic energy (`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`). This gives `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This value is an approximation. The key is correctly establishing the inverse relationship between kinetic energy and mass under the classical assumption.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Correct Relativistic T₁:**\n    *   **Principle:** Momentum is still conserved (`|p₁| = |p₂|`), but we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n    *   **Equation:** Since the momenta are equal, we can set `(p₁c)²` equal to `(p₂c)²`:\n        `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n    *   **Solution:** Substitute the known values (in GeV): `m₁c²=198`, `m₂c²=99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n        `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n        `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    *   **Careful Point:** The `T₁²` terms cancel out, simplifying the problem significantly. It is important to perform this algebra correctly.\n        `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n        `600T₁ = 603`\n        `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Find the Difference and Convert Units:**\n    *   **Calculation:** The difference between the correct and classical value is `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   **Unit Conversion:** The final answer must be in MeV. Using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n        `Difference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Ensure the subtraction is done correctly and the final unit conversion is applied.\n\nAll candidate agents who provided a detailed rationale correctly calculated this result.
