It then used the provided information to calculate the theoretical concentration of calcium ions. The dissociation constant (K_d) for the Ca-EDTA complex was calculated as the inverse of the formation constant (K_f), yielding K_d = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹.\n\nUsing the simplified equilibrium expression K_d ≈ [Ca²⁺]² / [Ca-EDTA]₀, the script calculated the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions as:\n[Ca²⁺] = √(K_d * [Ca-EDTA]₀) = √(2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ * 0.02) ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThis calculated value was then compared against the initial hypotheses. The value from hypothesis C (6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M) was a near-perfect match. The script correctly pruned the other options and selected C as the final answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the concentration of free calcium ions, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f) for this reaction is given as:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe are interested in the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe problem starts with a stoichiometric concentration of 0.02 M [Ca-EDTA]²⁻. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that form at equilibrium due to dissociation. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation reaction, the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ complex will be (0.02 - x).\n\nWe can set up the equilibrium expression using the formation constant:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\nGiven that K_f is very large (5 x 10¹⁰), the dissociation will be minimal. This means 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex, 0.02 M. Therefore, we can simplify the expression by approximating (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the [Ca²⁺]:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This calculation assumes an ideal pH where the fully deprotonated form of EDTA (Y⁴⁻) is the only one that needs to be considered, as implied by the problem statement.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nC) 2.0x10⁻² M\nD) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f) for this reaction is given as:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe are starting with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex will dissociate slightly into its constituent ions. Let's set up an equilibrium table for the dissociation reaction: [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n| | [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | [Ca²⁺] | [EDTA⁴⁻] |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Initial** | 0.02 M | 0 M | 0 M |\n| **Change** | -x | +x | +x |\n| **Equilibrium**| 0.02 - x | x | x |\n\nNow, we substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the dissociation will be minimal. This means that 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can simplify the expression by approximating (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we can solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 2.0x10⁻² M\nC) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nD) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions in the solution, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f) for this reaction is given as:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe are interested in the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe problem starts with a stoichiometric concentration of 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that forms from the dissociation of the complex at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex will be (0.02 - x) M.\n\nNow, we can substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning the dissociation of the complex is very small. Therefore, 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (x << 0.02). This allows us to simplify the equation:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe simplified expression becomes:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we can solve for x, which represents the [Ca²⁺]:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³ M²\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) M\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This confirms that our initial assumption (x << 0.02) was valid.\n\nThe problem specifies an \"ideal pH,\" which simplifies the calculation by allowing the direct use of the given formation constant. In reality, the stability of the complex is pH-dependent.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemistry**\n\n*   The problem involves a solution of a metal-ligand complex, specifically Calcium-EDTA ([CaY]²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA molecule).\n*   This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻).\n*   The equilibrium reaction for the *formation* of the complex is:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n*   The problem gives the formation constant (also called the stability constant) for this reaction:\n    K_f = K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n**2. Set up the Equilibrium Calculation**\n\n*   We are starting with a solution that contains 0.02 M of the complex [CaY]²⁻. This complex will slightly dissociate to reach equilibrium. Therefore, it is more convenient to consider the *dissociation* reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n*   The equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction, K_d, is the inverse of the formation constant, K_f:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**3. Use an ICE Table**\n\nTo find the equilibrium concentrations, we can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species       | [CaY]²⁻      | Ca²⁺         | Y⁴⁻          |\n|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Initial (I)** | 0.02 M       | 0 M          | 0 M          |\n| **Change (C)**  | -x           | +x           | +x           |\n| **Equilibrium (E)**| 0.02 - x     | x            | x            |\n\n**Careful Point:** The problem states \"ideal pH\". This is a crucial simplification. The binding of EDTA is pH-dependent. \"Ideal pH\" implies that the pH is high enough so that all free EDTA exists as the Y⁴⁻ ion. This allows us to use the given K_f value directly without correcting for protonation of EDTA.\n\n**4. Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve for x**\n\n*   The equilibrium expression for the dissociation reaction is:\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻]) / [[CaY]²⁻]\n*   Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into this expression:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n**5. Apply a Simplifying Assumption**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Because the dissociation constant K_d (2 x 10⁻¹¹) is extremely small, the equilibrium lies far to the left. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n*   We can make the assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. This simplifies the calculation significantly.\n*   The simplified equation is:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   Now, solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (2 x 10⁻²)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n*   Solve for x by taking the square root:\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    To make the exponent even, we can write this as:\n    x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    x = (√40) x 10⁻⁷\n    Since √36 = 6 and √49 = 7, √40 is approximately 6.3.\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n*   From our ICE table, the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n    [Ca²⁺] = x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**7. Verify the Assumption**\nIs x << 0.02?\n6.3 x 10⁻⁷ is much, much smaller than 0.02 (which is 2 x 10⁻²). The assumption was valid.\n\n**8. Conclusion**\nThe concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions in the solution, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation reaction of the Ca-EDTA complex is given by:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f) for this reaction is:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5x10¹⁰\n\nThe problem asks for the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. This means we need to consider the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant:\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹\n\nNow, we can set up an equilibrium table to find the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions.

This implies that the dissociation of the complex is minimal, and therefore 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can thus approximate (0.02 - x) as 0.02 to simplify the calculation.\n\n2x10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx² ≈ (2x10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\nx ≈ √(4x10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions at equilibrium is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M.

The key constraint was the dissociation constant, `Kd = 1 / Kf = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹`.\n2.  **Pruning:** The high stability of the complex (large Kf) allowed for the assumption that the dissociation `x` would be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. This pruning step immediately pointed towards Candidate A as the only plausible option.\n3.  **Verification:** The Python code tested all candidates against the exact equilibrium equation `Kd = x² / (0.02 - x)`.\n    *   **Candidate A (6.3x10⁻⁷ M):** Produced a calculated `Kd` of `1.98x10⁻¹¹`, which is almost identical to the target `Kd` of `2.0x10⁻¹¹`. This is a pass.\n    *   **Candidates B, C, and D:** Produced `Kd` values that were orders of magnitude different from the target, confirming they are incorrect.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports Candidate A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer**: My initial assessment is that this is a straightforward equilibrium calculation. The reaction is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex: [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻. We are given the initial concentration of the complex and the formation constant (Kf). I can calculate the dissociation constant (Kd = 1/Kf) and then use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions. The problem specifies an \"ideal pH,\" which I interpret to mean that we don't need to worry about the protonation of EDTA and can assume the given Kf is the conditional formation constant under these ideal conditions.\n\n**Skeptic**: Your approach seems sound, as this is a typical complexometric equilibrium problem. The \"ideal pH\" simplification is common in academic questions to avoid the more complex calculations involving alpha fractions of EDTA, which are pH-dependent. My main concern is to ensure the correct application of the equilibrium formula and the validity of any simplifying assumptions. Specifically, after setting up the equation Kd = x² / (0.02 - x), you will likely assume that 'x' is much smaller than 0.02. We must verify this assumption after solving for x to ensure the result is accurate.\n\n**Decision**: I will proceed with the calculation as proposed. The consensus is that this is a standard equilibrium problem where the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is the key process. I will calculate the dissociation constant, set up the equilibrium expression, solve for the calcium ion concentration, and then confirm that the simplifying assumption made during the calculation is valid.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Understand the equilibrium:** The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equation:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the dissociation constant (Kd):** The formation constant (Kf) is given as 5x10¹⁰. The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    Kd = 1 / Kf = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table:** Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺.\n    *   Initial concentration of [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ = 0.02 M\n    *   Initial concentration of Ca²⁺ = 0 M\n    *   Initial concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ = 0 M\n    *   At equilibrium, [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, and [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x.\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x:**\n    Kd = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n    2x10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Apply a simplifying assumption:** Since Kd is very small, the dissociation is minimal, meaning x will be much smaller than 0.02. Therefore, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    2x10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n6.  **Calculate x:**\n    x² ≈ (2x10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4x10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32x10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Verify the assumption:** The calculated value of x (6.32x10⁻⁷) is indeed significantly smaller than 0.02, so the approximation was valid.\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M.

The majority of agents correctly identify the method for solving the problem, but many fail at the final step of matching their calculated result to the correct multiple-choice letter.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis and careful points:**\n\n1.  **Reaction and Equilibrium Constant**: The problem starts with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. Therefore, the relevant equilibrium is the *dissociation* of this complex: `[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻`. The given constant is the *formation* constant (`K_f = 5x10¹⁰`). The correct constant to use for the dissociation reaction is the *dissociation* constant, `K_d = 1 / K_f = 2x10⁻¹¹`. Most agents correctly performed this inversion.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Expression**: Using an ICE table, if 'x' is the concentration of `Ca²⁺` at equilibrium, then `[EDTA⁴⁻]` is also 'x', and `[Ca-EDTA]²⁻` is `0.02 - x`. The equilibrium expression is `K_d = x² / (0.02 - x)`. This was set up correctly by nearly all agents.\n\n3.  **Simplifying Assumption**: Because `K_d` is extremely small, the dissociation 'x' is negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. This allows for the valid approximation `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`. The equation simplifies to `K_d ≈ x² / 0.02`.\n\n4.  **Calculation**: Solving for x gives `x² ≈ K_d * 0.02 = (2x10⁻¹¹) * 0.02 = 4x10⁻¹³`. Taking the square root gives `x ≈ 6.32x10⁻⁷ M`. This calculation was the consensus among all agents who showed their work.\n\n5.  **Matching Answer to Option**: This is the most critical point and where most errors occurred. The calculated value `6.3x10⁻⁷ M` must be matched to the original options:\n    A) 1.0x10⁻² M\n    B) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    C) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    D) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    The correct choice is **C**. The Python script confirms this by showing that only the value from hypothesis C produces the correct dissociation constant. Many agents (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 13, 15) correctly calculated the value but incorrectly mapped it to letters A, B, or D.\n\nThe Python script's systematic evaluation confirms that C is the only plausible answer.

According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation reaction, the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ complex will be (0.02 - x).\n\nWe can set up the equilibrium expression using the formation constant:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\nGiven that K_f is very large (5 x 10¹⁰), the dissociation will be minimal. This means 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex, 0.02 M. Therefore, we can simplify the expression by approximating (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the [Ca²⁺]:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.

Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that forms from the dissociation of the complex at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex will be (0.02 - x) M.\n\nNow, we can substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning the dissociation of the complex is very small. Therefore, 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (x << 0.02).

In reality, the stability of the complex is pH-dependent.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemistry**\n\n*   The problem involves a solution of a metal-ligand complex, specifically Calcium-EDTA ([CaY]²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA molecule).\n*   This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻).\n*   The equilibrium reaction for the *formation* of the complex is:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n*   The problem gives the formation constant (also called the stability constant) for this reaction:\n    K_f = K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n**2. Set up the Equilibrium Calculation**\n\n*   We are starting with a solution that contains 0.02 M of the complex [CaY]²⁻. This complex will slightly dissociate to reach equilibrium. Therefore, it is more convenient to consider the *dissociation* reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n*   The equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction, K_d, is the inverse of the formation constant, K_f:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**3. Use an ICE Table**\n\nTo find the equilibrium concentrations, we can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species       | [CaY]²⁻      | Ca²⁺         | Y⁴⁻          |\n|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Initial (I)** | 0.02 M       | 0 M          | 0 M          |\n| **Change (C)**  | -x           | +x           | +x           |\n| **Equilibrium (E)**| 0.02 - x     | x            | x            |\n\n**Careful Point:** The problem states \"ideal pH\". This is a crucial simplification. The binding of EDTA is pH-dependent. \"Ideal pH\" implies that the pH is high enough so that all free EDTA exists as the Y⁴⁻ ion. This allows us to use the given K_f value directly without correcting for protonation of EDTA.\n\n**4.

Apply a Simplifying Assumption**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Because the dissociation constant K_d (2 x 10⁻¹¹) is extremely small, the equilibrium lies far to the left.

The reaction is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex: [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻. We are given the initial concentration of the complex and the formation constant (Kf). I can calculate the dissociation constant (Kd = 1/Kf) and then use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions. The problem specifies an \"ideal pH,\" which I interpret to mean that we don't need to worry about the protonation of EDTA and can assume the given Kf is the conditional formation constant under these ideal conditions.\n\n**Skeptic**: Your approach seems sound, as this is a typical complexometric equilibrium problem. The \"ideal pH\" simplification is common in academic questions to avoid the more complex calculations involving alpha fractions of EDTA, which are pH-dependent. My main concern is to ensure the correct application of the equilibrium formula and the validity of any simplifying assumptions. Specifically, after setting up the equation Kd = x² / (0.02 - x), you will likely assume that 'x' is much smaller than 0.02. We must verify this assumption after solving for x to ensure the result is accurate.\n\n**Decision**: I will proceed with the calculation as proposed. The consensus is that this is a standard equilibrium problem where the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is the key process. I will calculate the dissociation constant, set up the equilibrium expression, solve for the calcium ion concentration, and then confirm that the simplifying assumption made during the calculation is valid.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Understand the equilibrium:** The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equation:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the dissociation constant (Kd):** The formation constant (Kf) is given as 5x10¹⁰.

Therefore, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    2x10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n6.  **Calculate x:**\n    x² ≈ (2x10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4x10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32x10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Verify the assumption:** The calculated value of x (6.32x10⁻⁷) is indeed significantly smaller than 0.02, so the approximation was valid.\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M.
