This correctly eliminated options C and D, which are only valid for a stationary charge.\n    *   The second constraint focused on the remaining candidates, A and B. The correct derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials from Maxwell's equations shows that the denominator contains the term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. The negative sign is crucial. This constraint eliminated option A, which incorrectly used a positive sign.\n3.  **Final Selection:** Option B was the only candidate to survive all constraints. It represents the standard, correct form for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The script also correctly noted that the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ holds for option B, given that $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe potentials are evaluated at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$. They depend on the properties of the charge at an earlier \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. This is the time at which the electromagnetic field was generated by the charge. The time difference, $t - t_r$, is the time it takes for the field to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n\nGiven the notation in the problem:\n*   $q$ is the point charge.\n*   $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $d$ is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n*   $\\epsilon_o$ is the permittivity of free space.\n*   $\\mu_o$ is the permeability of free space.\n\nThe scalar potential $V(\\vec{r},t)$ is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nThis can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe vector potential $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t)$ is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nSimilarly, this can be rewritten as:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions for $V(\\vec{r},t)$ and $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t)$ directly match the ones provided in option B.

Notice that:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right)$\nUsing the relationship $c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o}$, we get:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)$\n\nNow, let's compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect. The scalar potential is the static Coulomb potential, which is only valid for a stationary charge or at very low velocities.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This is incorrect. The sign in the denominator is positive, whereas the correct derivation yields a negative sign.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect for the same reason as A, and the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is dimensionally and structurally incorrect.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This option matches the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials perfectly. The scalar potential is $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$. The vector potential is $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived directly from Maxwell's equations and represent the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe calculation of the fields at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ must account for the fact that the electromagnetic signal travels at the speed of light, $c$. Therefore, the fields are determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$. This retarded time is defined by the relation $t - t_r = d/c$, where $d$ is the distance between the charge's position at $t_r$ and the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n\nThe scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) at position $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ are given by:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{ret}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{ret}$\n\nThe subscript \"ret\" signifies that the terms inside the brackets are to be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nTo match these standard forms with the given options, we can manipulate the expressions. By multiplying the numerator and denominator of the term in the brackets by $c$, we get:\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nFor the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nComparing these derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - The sign in the denominator is positive, which is incorrect.\n*   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - This represents the potential for a static charge and an incorrect relation for the vector potential.\n*   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - This is also based on the static potential and does not account for the motion of the charge in the potential's denominator.\n*   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - These expressions perfectly match the Liénard-Wiechert potentials derived above.\n\nIt is also a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials that the vector potential is related to the scalar potential by $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Let's verify this for option D:\n$\\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\nUsing the relation $c^2 = \\dfrac{1}{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o}$, we can substitute $\\epsilon_o = \\dfrac{1}{\\mu_o c^2}$:\n$\\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (\\frac{1}{\\mu_o c^2}) c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t)$.\nThe relationship holds for the expressions in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Scenario:** We are asked to find the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) at a specific point in space ($\\vec{r}$) and time (t) due to a point charge (q) moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$. This is a classic problem in electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n2.  **Recall the Concept of Retarded Time:** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, c. Therefore, the field observed at point $\\vec{r}$ at time t is not caused by the charge's state at time t, but by its state at an earlier time, called the **retarded time**, $t_r$. The signal emitted from the charge's position at $t_r$, which is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, must travel a distance $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time t. This relationship is given by:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n    Using the notation from the problem statement, where $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ and $d = |\\vec{d}|$, this becomes:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\n3.  **Start with the General Formulas for Retarded Potentials:** The potentials for any time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential integrals:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\n4.  **Apply to a Point Charge:** For a point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are represented by Dirac delta functions:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integrals (The Careful Point):** Substituting these densities into the potential integrals is not straightforward because the retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation (often done by changing variables or using properties of delta functions) yields a correction factor. This factor accounts for the \"compression\" or \"stretching\" of the apparent volume of the charge due to its motion relative to the observer (a relativistic Doppler-like effect).\n\n    The result of this integration is:\n    $\\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}} \\right]_{t'=t_r}$\n\n6.  **Write Down the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** Using the notation from the problem statement ($\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$, $d=|\\vec{d}|$, $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$), the expressions become:\n\n    *   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})}$\n        Multiplying the numerator and denominator by c gives:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n    *   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n        The derivation is identical, but with the current density $q\\vec{v}$ instead of the charge density $q$.\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})}$\n        Multiplying the numerator and denominator by c gives:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) Incorrect. These are quasi-static approximations, not the general solution.\n    *   B) Incorrect. The form of the vector potential is wrong.\n    *   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        This option perfectly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   D) Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. The correct sign is negative, which means the potential is larger when the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which are given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe scalar potential V and the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time t are determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$. This is the time at which the electromagnetic field must have been generated to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time t, traveling at the speed of light c.\n\nThe correct formulas are derived from Maxwell's equations and are given as follows:\n\nThe scalar potential is:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe vector potential is:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nIn these expressions, all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The vector $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$, and $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at that same retarded time.\n\nIt is also a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials that the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential V by the velocity of the charge $\\vec{v}$ and the speed of light c:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n\nComparing these standard forms with the given options, option D correctly represents both the scalar and vector potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which are the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n**1. Starting Point: Retarded Potentials**\n\nThe scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` at a position `r` and time `t` generated by a charge distribution `ρ(r', t')` and current distribution `J(r', t')` are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere `tr` is the retarded time, defined by the condition that the signal emitted at `tr` from position `r'` reaches `r` at time `t`:\n$t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$\n\n**2. Charge and Current Densities for a Point Charge**\n\nFor a single point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nwhere `v(t') = ds(t')/dt'` is the velocity of the charge at time `t'`.\n\n**3. Substituting into the Potential Integrals**\n\nLet's substitute these densities into the potential formulas. The integration is over the source coordinates `r'`. The delta function `δ³(r' - s(tr))` means the integrand is only non-zero when `r' = s(tr)`. However, the retarded time `tr` itself depends on `r'`. This makes the direct evaluation of the integral tricky.\n\nA more formal approach is to use the general integral solution involving the Green's function for the wave equation:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\iint \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} \\delta\\left(t' - \\left(t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}\\right)\\right) d^3r' dt'$\n\nSubstitute the charge density for the point charge:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\iint \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} \\delta\\left(t' - \\left(t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}\\right)\\right) d^3r' dt'$\n\nFirst, perform the spatial integral over `d³r'`. The `δ³` function collapses the integral, setting `r' = s(t')`:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\delta\\left(t' - \\left(t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}{c}\\right)\\right) dt'$\n\n**4. Evaluating the Time Integral**\n\nNow we need to evaluate the integral over `t'`. We use the property of the Dirac delta function:\n$\\int f(x) \\delta(g(x)) dx = \\sum_i \\frac{f(x_i)}{|g'(x_i)|}$, where `g(x_i) = 0`.\n\nIn our case, the variables are:\n- `x` is `t'`\n- `f(t') = 1 / |r - s(t')|`\n- `g(t') = t' - t + |r - s(t')| / c`\n\nThe root of `g(t') = 0` is the retarded time `tr`, which satisfies `tr - t + |r - s(tr)| / c = 0`. This is the definition of `tr`. Let's use the notation from the problem statement:\n- `d = r - s(tr)` is the vector from the retarded position to the observation point.\n- `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|` is the distance.\n- `v = v(tr)` is the velocity at the retarded time.\n\nSo the root is `t' = tr`. Now we need to compute the derivative `g'(t')` and evaluate it at `t' = tr`.\n\n$g'(t') = \\frac{d}{dt'} \\left( t' - t + \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}{c} \\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{d}{dt'} |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|$\n\nLet's compute the derivative of the distance term:\n$\\frac{d}{dt'} |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| = \\frac{d}{dt'} \\sqrt{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t'))}$\n$= \\frac{1}{2|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\cdot 2(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot (-\\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'})$\n$= -\\frac{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}$\n\nEvaluating at `t' = tr`:\n$\\left. \\frac{d}{dt'} |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| \\right|_{t'=t_r} = -\\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d}$\n\nNow substitute this back into the expression for `g'(tr)`:\n$g'(t_r) = 1 + \\frac{1}{c} \\left( -\\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d} \\right) = 1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{cd} = \\frac{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{cd}$\n\nSince `|v| < c`, the term `(d ⋅ v) / (cd)` is less than 1, so `g'(tr)` is positive and we don't need the absolute value.\n\n**5. Final Expression for the Potentials**\n\nNow we can find the scalar potential `V`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{f(t_r)}{g'(t_r)}$\n$f(t_r) = \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|} = \\frac{1}{d}$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1/d}{(cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}) / (cd)} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{cd}{d(cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe calculation for the vector potential `A` is identical, except the function `f(t')` is `v(t') / |r - s(t')|`.\n$f(t_r) = \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{d}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{f(t_r)}{g'(t_r)} = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{v}/d}{(cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}) / (cd)} = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{v}cd}{d(cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**6.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Background: Retarded Potentials\n\nFor a general time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$, the scalar and vector potentials at a field point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ are given by:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nHere, $t_r$ is the **retarded time**, which is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) must have been emitted from the source point $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. The signal travels at the speed of light, $c$. Thus, the retarded time is defined by the implicit equation:\n\n$t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Applying to a Moving Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge $q$ with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, we can express the charge and current densities using Dirac delta functions:\n\n*   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\nSubstituting these into the potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe main difficulty in evaluating these integrals is that the retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Integrals\n\nTo solve the integral, we can change the integration variable from space ($\\vec{r}'$) to time ($t'$). The integral effectively picks out the contribution from the charge at the unique retarded time $t_r$ when it was at position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n\nA standard derivation (which involves evaluating the integral with the delta function whose argument depends on the integration variable) yields the following result. The volume element $d^3r'$ gets transformed in a way that introduces a correction factor. The effective volume occupied by the charge appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to its motion (a Doppler-like effect).\n\nThe result of the integration is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nWhere all quantities in the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$:\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the distance from the charge's retarded position to the field point.\n*   The retarded time $t_r$ is determined by the condition $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n### 4. Final Expressions\n\nLet's rewrite the potentials to match the format of the options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThese expressions are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This exactly matches our derived result.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect. It uses the static potential form and ignores the crucial retardation effect in the denominator, which depends on the velocity.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This is incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. A '+' sign would correspond to advanced potentials (effects preceding their cause), which are typically discarded as unphysical.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect for the same reason as B, and the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also dimensionally and structurally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge, which are described by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key is to recognize the standard formulas and match them to the given notation.\n\n1.  **Identify the core physics:** The problem describes a classic scenario in electromagnetism: finding the potentials of a moving point charge, accounting for the finite speed of light (retardation). The solutions are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n2.  **Recall/Derive the Liénard-Wiechert formulas:**\n    The scalar potential ($V$ or $\\phi$) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) are given by:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n\n3.  **Translate to the problem's notation:**\n    *   The vector from the retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d}$. In the standard formula, this is $\\vec{R}$.\n    *   The magnitude of this vector is $d$. In the standard formula, this is $R$.\n    *   The unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is therefore $\\vec{d}/d$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge is $\\vec{v}$.\n    *   The normalized velocity $\\vec{\\beta}$ is $\\vec{v}/c$.\n\n4.  **Substitute and simplify the denominator:**\n    The crucial term in the denominator is $R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$. Substituting the problem's notation:\n    $d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}\\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n5.  **Rewrite the potentials:**\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n6.  **Match to the options:**\n    The options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. We can achieve this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of our expressions by $c$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n7.  **Compare:**\n    These expressions exactly match option D. The negative sign in the denominator is characteristic of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials and accounts for the Doppler-like effect of the moving source.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` depends on the state of the charge at an earlier \"retarded\" time, `tr`.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined implicitly by the equation $t - t_r = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| / c$, which simplifies to $t - t_r = d/c$, where `d` is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$.\n\nThe correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\nThis can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThe vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential `V` by the expression $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$. Applying this relationship, we get:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right)$\n\nUsing the identity $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we can simplify the expression for the vector potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}}{1} \\left( \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nComparing these derived expressions with the given options, we find that option D matches both the scalar and vector potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion. They are fundamental in classical electrodynamics for calculating the fields of moving charges, accounting for the finite speed of light.\n\nThe potentials are evaluated at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$, but they depend on the properties of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time, $t_r$. This is the instant when the electromagnetic field was generated by the charge. The relationship between the observation time and the retarded time is given by $t = t_r + d/c$, where $d$ is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$ from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe derivation of these potentials starts from the general formulas for retarded potentials for continuous charge and current distributions and applies them to a point charge. The final expressions for the scalar potential V and the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nHere, all quantities in the brackets on the right-hand side are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.

This is a standard problem in electrodynamics, and the solution is given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. I will perform a search to find the standard expressions for these potentials and then match them to the given options, paying close attention to the notation defined in the prompt.\n\n**Skeptic**: The notation is critical here. We have $\\vec{d}$ as the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$, and $\\vec{v}$ is the charge's velocity at $t_r$. The options differ primarily in the denominator, specifically the sign of the $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ term. A simple search might give the formula in a different notation, so careful translation will be necessary. We must confirm the exact form of the denominator, which accounts for the fact that the distance the field information has to travel depends on the charge's motion.\n\n**Decision**: The next action will be to search for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials and their derivation to ensure the correct form of the denominator.\n\n**Proposer**: The search results confirm that the potentials for a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Result provides the scalar potential in a notation very similar to the problem's. It gives the scalar potential as $\\phi(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r| - \\vec{\\beta} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r)}$, where $\\vec{r}_r$ is the retarded position and $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}_r/c$.\n\n**Skeptic**: Let's carefully translate this to the notation given in the question.\n*   The vector from the retarded position to the observation point, $\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r$, is what the problem calls $\\vec{d}$.\n*   The magnitude $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r|$ is therefore $d$.\n*   The velocity at the retarded time, $\\vec{v}_r$, is what the problem calls $\\vec{v}$.\n*   So, $\\vec{\\beta}$ is $\\vec{v}/c$.\n\nSubstituting these into the formula from the search result:\nThe denominator is $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r| - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r) = d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}$.\nThis can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$.\n\nSo the scalar potential is $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$.\n\nThis matches the scalar potential in option B.\n\n**Proposer**: Now for the vector potential, $\\vec{A}$. It is well-established that for a single moving point charge, the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential $V$ by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Let's apply this to the scalar potential we just found.\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$.\n\nUsing the relation $c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_o \\mu_o}$, we can write $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_o c} = \\mu_o c$.\nSubstituting this in, we get:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o c q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$.\n\nThis expression for $\\vec{A}$ matches the one in option B.\n\n**Skeptic**: The derivation seems sound and the translation of notation is correct. The key was identifying the correct form of the denominator, which includes the negative sign. The relationship between $\\vec{A}$ and $V$ is also correctly applied. Both parts of option B have been derived from the standard Liénard-Wiechert potential formulas found in the search results. The other options are incorrect due to either using a static potential form or having the wrong sign in the denominator.\n\n**Conclusion**: The debate converges.

An analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step logical deduction lead to a single correct choice.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Provided Answers**: A review of the 14 candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the correct physical formulas. The agents that correctly derive the potentials (Answers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14) all arrive at expressions with a denominator of the form `(dc - d.v)`. However, many of these agents incorrectly map this correct formula to the wrong letter option (e.g., Answer 7 derives the correct formula but calls it 'B'). This suggests a widespread issue with the labeling of options in the agents' contexts. The agents that are internally consistent (i.e., their derived formula matches the formula of the option they choose) all select option **D**.\n\n2.  **Step-by-Step Deduction**:\n    *   **Hypotheses**: The four options A, B, C, and D are the initial hypotheses.\n    *   **Constraint 1 (Non-Static Form)**: The potentials for a moving charge must account for retardation. The expressions must depend on `d` (the distance from the charge's retarded position) and its velocity `v`. Options A and B use the static potential form `V ∝ 1/r`, which is incorrect. This eliminates **A** and **B**.\n    *   **Constraint 2 (Correct Sign in Denominator)**: The remaining options are C and D. The denominator term `(dc - d.v)` accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect. The negative sign is crucial for retarded potentials (the potential is stronger when the charge moves towards the observer). Option C has a `+` sign, which is incorrect for this physical scenario. This eliminates **C**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Only option **D** survives the physical constraints. It correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials with the proper dependence on retarded position, velocity, and the correct sign for the Doppler factor. The known relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ also holds for the expressions in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",

The potential from a moving charge must depend on its position when the field was emitted (the retarded position), not a static distance `r`. This correctly eliminated options A and B.\n    *   **Constraint 2 (Doppler Factor):** The script then checked the sign in the denominator of the remaining candidates.

These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe potentials are evaluated at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$. They depend on the properties of the charge at an earlier \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. This is the time at which the electromagnetic field was generated by the charge. The time difference, $t - t_r$, is the time it takes for the field to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n\nGiven the notation in the problem:\n*   $q$ is the point charge.\n*   $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $d$ is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n*   $\\epsilon_o$ is the permittivity of free space.\n*   $\\mu_o$ is the permeability of free space.\n\nThe scalar potential $V(\\vec{r},t)$ is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nThis can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe vector potential $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t)$ is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nSimilarly, this can be rewritten as:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions for $V(\\vec{r},t)$ and $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t)$ directly match the ones provided in option B.

The vector potential is $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived directly from Maxwell's equations and represent the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe calculation of the fields at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ must account for the fact that the electromagnetic signal travels at the speed of light, $c$. Therefore, the fields are determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$. This retarded time is defined by the relation $t - t_r = d/c$, where $d$ is the distance between the charge's position at $t_r$ and the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n\nThe scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) at position $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ are given by:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{ret}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{ret}$\n\nThe subscript \"ret\" signifies that the terms inside the brackets are to be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nTo match these standard forms with the given options, we can manipulate the expressions. By multiplying the numerator and denominator of the term in the brackets by $c$, we get:\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nFor the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nComparing these derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - The sign in the denominator is positive, which is incorrect.\n*   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - This represents the potential for a static charge and an incorrect relation for the vector potential.\n*   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - This is also based on the static potential and does not account for the motion of the charge in the potential's denominator.\n*   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - These expressions perfectly match the Liénard-Wiechert potentials derived above.\n\nIt is also a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials that the vector potential is related to the scalar potential by $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Let's verify this for option D:\n$\\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\nUsing the relation $c^2 = \\dfrac{1}{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o}$, we can substitute $\\epsilon_o = \\dfrac{1}{\\mu_o c^2}$:\n$\\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (\\frac{1}{\\mu_o c^2}) c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t)$.\nThe relationship holds for the expressions in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Scenario:** We are asked to find the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) at a specific point in space ($\\vec{r}$) and time (t) due to a point charge (q) moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$. This is a classic problem in electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n2.  **Recall the Concept of Retarded Time:** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, c. Therefore, the field observed at point $\\vec{r}$ at time t is not caused by the charge's state at time t, but by its state at an earlier time, called the **retarded time**, $t_r$. The signal emitted from the charge's position at $t_r$, which is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, must travel a distance $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time t. This relationship is given by:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n    Using the notation from the problem statement, where $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ and $d = |\\vec{d}|$, this becomes:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\n3.  **Start with the General Formulas for Retarded Potentials:** The potentials for any time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential integrals:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\n4.  **Apply to a Point Charge:** For a point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are represented by Dirac delta functions:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integrals (The Careful Point):** Substituting these densities into the potential integrals is not straightforward because the retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation (often done by changing variables or using properties of delta functions) yields a correction factor. This factor accounts for the \"compression\" or \"stretching\" of the apparent volume of the charge due to its motion relative to the observer (a relativistic Doppler-like effect).\n\n    The result of this integration is:\n    $\\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}} \\right]_{t'=t_r}$\n\n6.  **Write Down the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** Using the notation from the problem statement ($\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$, $d=|\\vec{d}|$, $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$), the expressions become:\n\n    *   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})}$\n        Multiplying the numerator and denominator by c gives:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n    *   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n        The derivation is identical, but with the current density $q\\vec{v}$ instead of the charge density $q$.\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})}$\n        Multiplying the numerator and denominator by c gives:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) Incorrect. These are quasi-static approximations, not the general solution.\n    *   B) Incorrect. The form of the vector potential is wrong.\n    *   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        This option perfectly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   D) Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. The correct sign is negative, which means the potential is larger when the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which are given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe scalar potential V and the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time t are determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$. This is the time at which the electromagnetic field must have been generated to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time t, traveling at the speed of light c.\n\nThe correct formulas are derived from Maxwell's equations and are given as follows:\n\nThe scalar potential is:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe vector potential is:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nIn these expressions, all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The vector $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$, and $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at that same retarded time.\n\nIt is also a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials that the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential V by the velocity of the charge $\\vec{v}$ and the speed of light c:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n\nComparing these standard forms with the given options, option D correctly represents both the scalar and vector potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which are the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n**1. Starting Point: Retarded Potentials**\n\nThe scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` at a position `r` and time `t` generated by a charge distribution `ρ(r', t')` and current distribution `J(r', t')` are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere `tr` is the retarded time, defined by the condition that the signal emitted at `tr` from position `r'` reaches `r` at time `t`:\n$t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$\n\n**2. Charge and Current Densities for a Point Charge**\n\nFor a single point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nwhere `v(t') = ds(t')/dt'` is the velocity of the charge at time `t'`.\n\n**3. Substituting into the Potential Integrals**\n\nLet's substitute these densities into the potential formulas. The integration is over the source coordinates `r'`. The delta function `δ³(r' - s(tr))` means the integrand is only non-zero when `r' = s(tr)`. However, the retarded time `tr` itself depends on `r'`. This makes the direct evaluation of the integral tricky.\n\nA more formal approach is to use the general integral solution involving the Green's function for the wave equation:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\iint \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} \\delta\\left(t' - \\left(t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}\\right)\\right) d^3r' dt'$\n\nSubstitute the charge density for the point charge:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\iint \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} \\delta\\left(t' - \\left(t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}\\right)\\right) d^3r' dt'$\n\nFirst, perform the spatial integral over `d³r'`. The `δ³` function collapses the integral, setting `r' = s(t')`:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\delta\\left(t' - \\left(t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}{c}\\right)\\right) dt'$\n\n**4. Evaluating the Time Integral**\n\nNow we need to evaluate the integral over `t'`. We use the property of the Dirac delta function:\n$\\int f(x) \\delta(g(x)) dx = \\sum_i \\frac{f(x_i)}{|g'(x_i)|}$, where `g(x_i) = 0`.\n\nIn our case, the variables are:\n- `x` is `t'`\n- `f(t') = 1 / |r - s(t')|`\n- `g(t') = t' - t + |r - s(t')| / c`\n\nThe root of `g(t') = 0` is the retarded time `tr`, which satisfies `tr - t + |r - s(tr)| / c = 0`. This is the definition of `tr`. Let's use the notation from the problem statement:\n- `d = r - s(tr)` is the vector from the retarded position to the observation point.\n- `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|` is the distance.\n- `v = v(tr)` is the velocity at the retarded time.\n\nSo the root is `t' = tr`. Now we need to compute the derivative `g'(t')` and evaluate it at `t' = tr`.\n\n$g'(t') = \\frac{d}{dt'} \\left( t' - t + \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}{c} \\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{d}{dt'} |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|$\n\nLet's compute the derivative of the distance term:\n$\\frac{d}{dt'} |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| = \\frac{d}{dt'} \\sqrt{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t'))}$\n$= \\frac{1}{2|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\cdot 2(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot (-\\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'})$\n$= -\\frac{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}$\n\nEvaluating at `t' = tr`:\n$\\left. \\frac{d}{dt'} |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| \\right|_{t'=t_r} = -\\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d}$\n\nNow substitute this back into the expression for `g'(tr)`:\n$g'(t_r) = 1 + \\frac{1}{c} \\left( -\\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d} \\right) = 1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{cd} = \\frac{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{cd}$\n\nSince `|v| < c`, the term `(d ⋅ v) / (cd)` is less than 1, so `g'(tr)` is positive and we don't need the absolute value.\n\n**5. Final Expression for the Potentials**\n\nNow we can find the scalar potential `V`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{f(t_r)}{g'(t_r)}$\n$f(t_r) = \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|} = \\frac{1}{d}$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1/d}{(cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}) / (cd)} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{cd}{d(cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe calculation for the vector potential `A` is identical, except the function `f(t')` is `v(t') / |r - s(t')|`.\n$f(t_r) = \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{d}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{f(t_r)}{g'(t_r)} = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{v}/d}{(cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}) / (cd)} = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{v}cd}{d(cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**6. Comparing with the Options**\n\nThe derived expressions are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option B exactly.\n\n- Option A has a `+` sign, which would correspond to advanced potentials (violating causality in this context).\n- Option C uses the wrong distance `r` and misses the relativistic correction factor in the denominator.\n- Option D has the same error for `V` as C and a dimensionally incorrect formula for `A`.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Background: Retarded Potentials\n\nFor a general time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$, the scalar and vector potentials at a field point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ are given by:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nHere, $t_r$ is the **retarded time**, which is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) must have been emitted from the source point $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. The signal travels at the speed of light, $c$. Thus, the retarded time is defined by the implicit equation:\n\n$t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Applying to a Moving Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge $q$ with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, we can express the charge and current densities using Dirac delta functions:\n\n*   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\nSubstituting these into the potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe main difficulty in evaluating these integrals is that the retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Integrals\n\nTo solve the integral, we can change the integration variable from space ($\\vec{r}'$) to time ($t'$). The integral effectively picks out the contribution from the charge at the unique retarded time $t_r$ when it was at position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n\nA standard derivation (which involves evaluating the integral with the delta function whose argument depends on the integration variable) yields the following result. The volume element $d^3r'$ gets transformed in a way that introduces a correction factor. The effective volume occupied by the charge appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to its motion (a Doppler-like effect).\n\nThe result of the integration is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nWhere all quantities in the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$:\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the distance from the charge's retarded position to the field point.\n*   The retarded time $t_r$ is determined by the condition $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n### 4. Final Expressions\n\nLet's rewrite the potentials to match the format of the options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThese expressions are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This exactly matches our derived result.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect. It uses the static potential form and ignores the crucial retardation effect in the denominator, which depends on the velocity.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This is incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. A '+' sign would correspond to advanced potentials (effects preceding their cause), which are typically discarded as unphysical.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect for the same reason as B, and the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also dimensionally and structurally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge, which are described by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

The relationship between the observation time and the retarded time is given by $t = t_r + d/c$, where $d$ is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$ from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe derivation of these potentials starts from the general formulas for retarded potentials for continuous charge and current distributions and applies them to a point charge. The final expressions for the scalar potential V and the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nHere, all quantities in the brackets on the right-hand side are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The terms are defined as:\n*   $q$ is the charge of the point particle.\n*   $\\epsilon_o$ is the permittivity of free space.\n*   $\\mu_o$ is the permeability of free space.\n*   $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $d$ is the magnitude of $\\vec{d}$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at $t_r$.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nBy factoring out $c$ from the denominator, the expressions can be rewritten as:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option A. It is also noteworthy that the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential $V$ by the expression $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe potentials are evaluated at the observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$, but they depend on the properties of the charge at an earlier \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge's position, $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, to reach the observer at $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\nThe correct formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nHere, the terms in the square brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The vector $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point, and $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\nTo match these standard forms with the given options, we can manipulate the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nComparing these derived expressions with the given choices, we find that they match option B. It is also worth noting that the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential $V$ by the expression $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe provided code output confirms the step-by-step elimination of candidates A, B, and D based on physical constraints.\n\n1.  **Constraint 1 (Vector Nature of A):** Candidate D was eliminated because its expression for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ was a scalar, which is fundamentally incorrect.\n2.  **Constraint 2 (Dependence on Retarded Position):** Candidate B was eliminated because its potential $V$ depends on $r$, the distance from the origin, rather than $d$, the distance from the charge's position at the retarded time. The fields are generated by the charge at its location, not by the origin.\n3.  **Constraint 3 (Physical Sign of the Doppler Factor):** Candidate A was eliminated because the sign in its denominator is incorrect. For a charge moving towards an observer, the potential should increase due to the Doppler effect. The denominator $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ in candidate C correctly becomes smaller, increasing the potential, whereas the denominator $(dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ in candidate A would incorrectly decrease it.\n\nThe only remaining candidate is C, which correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n**Proposer**: The problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge. This is a standard problem in electrodynamics, and the solution is given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. I will perform a search to find the standard expressions for these potentials and then match them to the given options, paying close attention to the notation defined in the prompt.\n\n**Skeptic**: The notation is critical here. We have $\\vec{d}$ as the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$, and $\\vec{v}$ is the charge's velocity at $t_r$. The options differ primarily in the denominator, specifically the sign of the $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ term. A simple search might give the formula in a different notation, so careful translation will be necessary. We must confirm the exact form of the denominator, which accounts for the fact that the distance the field information has to travel depends on the charge's motion.\n\n**Decision**: The next action will be to search for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials and their derivation to ensure the correct form of the denominator.\n\n**Proposer**: The search results confirm that the potentials for a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Result provides the scalar potential in a notation very similar to the problem's. It gives the scalar potential as $\\phi(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r| - \\vec{\\beta} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r)}$, where $\\vec{r}_r$ is the retarded position and $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}_r/c$.\n\n**Skeptic**: Let's carefully translate this to the notation given in the question.\n*   The vector from the retarded position to the observation point, $\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r$, is what the problem calls $\\vec{d}$.\n*   The magnitude $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r|$ is therefore $d$.\n*   The velocity at the retarded time, $\\vec{v}_r$, is what the problem calls $\\vec{v}$.\n*   So, $\\vec{\\beta}$ is $\\vec{v}/c$.\n\nSubstituting these into the formula from the search result:\nThe denominator is $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r| - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_r) = d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}$.\nThis can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$.\n\nSo the scalar potential is $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$.\n\nThis matches the scalar potential in option B.\n\n**Proposer**: Now for the vector potential, $\\vec{A}$. It is well-established that for a single moving point charge, the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential $V$ by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Let's apply this to the scalar potential we just found.\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$.\n\nUsing the relation $c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_o \\mu_o}$, we can write $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_o c} = \\mu_o c$.\nSubstituting this in, we get:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o c q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$.\n\nThis expression for $\\vec{A}$ matches the one in option B.\n\n**Skeptic**: The derivation seems sound and the translation of notation is correct. The key was identifying the correct form of the denominator, which includes the negative sign. The relationship between $\\vec{A}$ and $V$ is also correctly applied. Both parts of option B have been derived from the standard Liénard-Wiechert potential formulas found in the search results. The other options are incorrect due to either using a static potential form or having the wrong sign in the denominator.\n\n**Conclusion**: The debate converges. Option B correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials in the given notation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",
