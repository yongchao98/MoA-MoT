This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This often occurs when a carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, creating a chiral center. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a double bond, and the atoms involved in the double bond lie in a plane. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and, therefore, optically inactive.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS), which specify a particular three-dimensional arrangement of atoms. This indicates that the molecule is chiral and is present as a single enantiomer, not a mixture. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This compound has two chiral centers (at carbons 2 and 3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. Such compounds are called meso compounds, and they are achiral and optically inactive despite having chiral centers.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule also has two chiral centers. The (2R, 3R) configuration is one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being 2S, 3S). This molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is chiral. As it is specified as a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The (R) designation indicates a specific configuration at the chiral center (carbon 1), which is bonded to four different groups. Since a single enantiomer is specified, the compound is optically active.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** An examination of this molecule's structure reveals that it does not contain any chiral centers. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most often caused by the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The carbons of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The molecule as a whole is planar and therefore has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex bicyclic compound includes stereochemical descriptors \"(3aR,7aS)\". These indicate the presence of specific configurations at chiral centers. A molecule with chiral centers is chiral and thus optically active, unless it is a meso compound (which has an internal plane of symmetry). The specification of a single enantiomer confirms its chiral nature. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the molecule is symmetrical, with a carboxylic acid group at each end. The (2R,3S) configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry between the two chiral carbons. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. It has two chiral centers, but the (2R,3R) configuration does not result in an internal plane of symmetry. The molecule is chiral and its mirror image is the non-superimposable (2S,3S) enantiomer. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different carbon pathways around the ring (-CH=CH- and -CH2-CH2-). This makes C1 a chiral center. The \"(R)\" designation indicates that this is a specific enantiomer. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one of the C-OH bonds and the opposite CH2 group bisects the molecule into two identical halves. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: To determine if this compound is chiral, we look for chiral centers or other elements of chirality. The structure is (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that includes the cyclopentyl ring and the carbonyl group, bisecting the isobutyl group. Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nIn summary, three of the compounds listed will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and not a meso compound (an achiral compound with stereocenters). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ** (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The carbons of the double bond are sp2 hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. There are no other chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule is planar with respect to the double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\n2.  ** (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name itself specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer with defined configurations (R and S) at its chiral centers. The presence of these stereochemical descriptors indicates that the molecule is chiral. As a specific enantiomer, it will be optically active.\n\n3.  ** (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with a plane of symmetry between these two carbons, where one half is the mirror image of the other. This is a classic example of a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is not optically active.\n\n4.  ** (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule also has two chiral centers. The (2R,3R) configuration is diastereomeric to the meso form. This isomer is chiral and its mirror image, the (2S,3S) isomer, is non-superimposable. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ** (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at carbon 1, which is a chiral center. The molecule is designated as a single enantiomer, which means it is chiral and will be optically active.\n\n6.  ** (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This compound is also known as cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol. The three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and the opposing CH2 group on the ring. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n\n7.  ** 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** This ketone does not contain any chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized. All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are bonded to two hydrogens (or two other carbons in the ring), and the isobutyl group also lacks a chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary, three of the compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture. The compounds given with specific stereochemical descriptors (like R, S) are considered as single enantiomers, which are optically active if the molecule is chiral.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Chirality:** A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Chiral Center:** A common source of chirality is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Elements of Symmetry:** A molecule is achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n*   **Meso Compounds:** These are achiral molecules that contain chiral centers. They are achiral due to an internal element of symmetry.\n*   **Stereochemical Descriptors (R/S):** If a name includes R/S descriptors, it refers to a specific stereoisomer. If this stereoisomer is one of a pair of enantiomers, it is optically active. If it describes a meso compound, it is optically inactive.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms attached to the double bond carbons (C1 and C2) lie in the same plane.\n        ```\n            Cl   CH3\n             \\ /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n            H   CH2CH3\n        ```\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral. It has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)` specify a single, unique stereoisomer. The presence of `R` and `S` confirms the existence of chiral centers. The parent structure without the `=CHCl` group is a meso compound, but the substituent on the methano-bridge (C8) destroys all planes of symmetry. Since the molecule has chiral centers and lacks internal symmetry, it is chiral. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereochemistry is specified as `(2R,3S)`. This particular combination of stereocenters results in a molecule with a plane of symmetry that lies between C2 and C3.\n        ```\n              COOH\n              |\n        H --- C --- CH3\n        ------|------  <-- Plane of symmetry\n        CH3 -- C --- H\n              |\n              COOH\n        (A possible conformation with a plane of symmetry)\n        ```\n    *   A molecule with chiral centers but also an internal plane of symmetry is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereochemistry is specified as `(2R,3R)`. This stereoisomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are a pair of enantiomers. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond and an alcohol group.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at C1. The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH=CH- (part of the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (part of the ring). Therefore, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and the `(R)` designation refers to a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** This highly symmetrical molecule possesses three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one carbon bearing an -OH group and the carbon atom directly opposite it (e.g., a plane containing C1 and C4). The presence of even one plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The IUPAC name describes the following structure: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to check for any chiral centers or other elements of chirality. The only potential chiral center in the chain is C3, but it is bonded to two identical methyl groups (`(CH3)2CH-`), so it is not a chiral center. The cyclopentyl ring is also symmetrically attached. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the `H-C3-C2-C1=O` atoms and bisects the two methyl groups on C3 and the cyclopentyl ring. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Count**\n\nLet's summarize which compounds are optically active:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Active**\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not a meso compound. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is typically due to the presence of one or more chiral centers. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a double bond, and the atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name of this compound specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer using the (3aR,7aS) designation. This indicates the presence of chiral centers and that we are considering a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule possesses two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. Such a compound is called a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers and is thus optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This stereoisomer of dimethylsuccinic acid is a chiral molecule. It is the enantiomer of the (2S,3S) form and does not have an internal plane of symmetry. As a specific enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups (a hydroxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different carbon pathways within the ring), making it a chiral center. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer and therefore optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** In this molecule, all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** To determine if this molecule is chiral, we look for chiral centers. The structure is (CH₃)₂CHCH₂C(=O)C₅H₉. The carbon atom in the `CH` group is bonded to two identical methyl (CH₃) groups, so it is not a chiral center. There are no other chiral centers in the molecule, and it lacks any other elements of chirality, making it optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nMy initial analysis and the code output have a discrepancy. Let's re-evaluate the compounds one by one. The key concept is that a compound is optically active if and only if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of stereocenters (chiral centers) often leads to chirality, but if a molecule with stereocenters has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is achiral and called a meso compound.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. This molecule is planar around the double bond. It has no chiral centers. The plane of the molecule is a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name explicitly gives the absolute configuration of a specific stereoisomer using (R), (S), and (E) descriptors. When a single, specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is isolated, it is by definition optically active. This complex molecule lacks any symmetry elements, so it is chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are identical to the substituents on C3. When two such identical stereocenters in a molecule have opposite configurations (one R, one S), the molecule is a meso compound. A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it achiral despite the presence of stereocenters. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**. The initial python code was flawed in its logic, as it incorrectly identified any molecule with R/S centers as active, failing to account for meso compounds. My manual analysis was correct.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. Here, the two identical stereocenters have the same configuration (both R). This molecule lacks any internal symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image (the (2S,3S) isomer). Therefore, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1) is a stereocenter. It is bonded to -H, -OH, and two different paths around the ring (`-CH2-CH=CH-` and `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single chiral molecule. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses three planes of symmetry, each passing through a C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond. Due to these symmetry planes, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. A careful examination reveals no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers. The molecule also has a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group and the isobutyl group, bisecting the cyclopentyl ring. Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary of optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn optically active compound is a chiral compound that is present in a non-racemic form (i.e., as a single enantiomer or an unequal mixture of enantiomers). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks any improper axis of rotation (which includes planes of symmetry and centers of inversion).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. The atoms around the C=C double bond lie in a single plane. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral. Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E), which specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer. The complex and asymmetric structure of the molecule's carbon framework, along with the `8-(chloromethylene)` substituent, ensures that the molecule lacks internal symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is chiral. Since a specific single stereoisomer (an enantiomer or a diastereomer) is named, it is not a racemic mixture. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric, as the groups attached to C2 are the same as those attached to C3. The (2R,3S) stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry that passes between C2 and C3 (in an eclipsed conformation) or a center of inversion (in a staggered conformation). A compound with chiral centers that is achiral overall due to internal symmetry is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers form an enantiomeric pair. They are chiral because they lack any internal symmetry elements and are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. The name specifies the (2R,3R) enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. The carbon atom bearing the -OH group (C1) is a chiral center because the two paths around the ring from this carbon are different (`-CH2-CH=CH-` vs. `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: For the carbons C1, C3, and C5 to be stereocenters that can be assigned a configuration (like 's' or 'r'), the molecule must be chiral. If the molecule were the all-cis isomer (where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring), it would be achiral (meso) due to a plane of symmetry. In such a symmetric molecule, C1, C3, and C5 are prochiral, not true chiral centers. Therefore, the name `(1s,3s,5s)` must refer to a chiral isomer, such as one where two -OH groups are cis and one is trans (e.g., up, up, down). Such an isomer is chiral. The name specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral compound. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two methyl groups (`-CH3` and the terminal `CH3` of the chain), and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. No other carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n\nThere are a total of 4 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine how many of the compounds are optically active, we need to assess each one for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule has a chiral center and lacks any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   Structure: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   This molecule has a double bond. There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups). The molecule itself is planar around the double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule).\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself provides stereochemical descriptors (`R` and `S`), which indicate the presence of chiral centers with a specific configuration.\n    *   The designation `(3aR,7aS)` specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. A single enantiomer is, by definition, optically active. The molecule is a complex bridged system and lacks internal symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral and therefore **optically active**.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric, as the groups attached to C2 are the same as those attached to C3.\n    *   The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule with a plane of symmetry (in the eclipsed conformation) or a center of inversion (in the anti-periplanar conformation). This is a **meso compound**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral (meso) and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound, and they are not superimposable. This is a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral and therefore **optically active**.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH=CH- (part of the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (part of the ring). Thus, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral and therefore **optically active**.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is the isomer where all three hydroxyl (-OH) groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv). Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl` which can be written as `(CH3)2CH-CH2-CO-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a `CH2-CO-Cyclopentyl` group, and two identical methyl (`CH3`) groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   There are no other chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.\n*   Optically inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is an analysis of the optical activity for each of the seven compounds:\n\n1.  ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a double bond, and the atoms attached to the double bond are different, which allows for E/Z isomerism. However, it does not contain any chiral centers (a carbon atom with four different substituents). The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that includes the double bond, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)*-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this compound includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E), which specify a particular stereoisomer. The presence of these \"R\" and \"S\" designations indicates the existence of chiral centers. A specific enantiomer like this is, by definition, chiral and will exhibit optical activity.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with a plane of symmetry between these two centers. The substituents on one side of the plane are a mirror image of the substituents on the other. This type of compound is called a \"meso\" compound. Despite having chiral centers, meso compounds are achiral overall and thus optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound also has two chiral centers. Unlike its meso counterpart, the (2R, 3R) configuration does not have a plane of symmetry. This molecule is chiral and will be optically active. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S, 3S) enantiomer.\n\n5.  ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The \"(R)\" in the name indicates that this is a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The chiral center is the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1). This carbon is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, the hydroxyl group, a -CH=CH- group within the ring, and a -CH2-CH2- group within the ring. As a specific enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has the three hydroxyl groups in a cis configuration, meaning they are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and the carbon opposite to it, bisecting the ring. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: To determine if this molecule is chiral, we must look for a chiral center. The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon, which is bonded to a butyl chain with a methyl group at position 3. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl group, and two identical methyl groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no chiral centers and is achiral, making it optically inactive.\n\nIn summary:\n*   Optically active: **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**, **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**, and **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**.\n*   Optically inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, and 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.\n\nTherefore, 3 of the compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not a meso compound. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This analysis determines the optical activity for each of the seven compounds listed.\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond and no chiral centers. The molecule itself is achiral as the plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry, making it optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS), which specify the three-dimensional arrangement at chiral centers. The presence of these descriptors for a specific, complex molecule indicates that it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound and is therefore optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the molecule is symmetrical, and the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a plane of symmetry. This specific stereoisomer is a meso compound, which is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the compound above. The (2R, 3R) configuration lacks a plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image (the 2S, 3S isomer). Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name explicitly indicates the (R) configuration at a chiral center. The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1) is attached to four different groups, making it a chiral center. As a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (*cis*). This arrangement gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry, including multiple planes of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this ketone is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. An examination of the structure reveals that there are no chiral centers. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, three of the compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we must assess each one for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic (50:50) mixture of enantiomers. Generally, a molecule is chiral if it lacks an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\nHere is the analysis of each compound:\n\n*   ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule lacks a chiral center. The carbon atoms of the double bond are each bonded to only two different groups, and the other carbons in the chain do not have four different substituents. The molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n*   ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name explicitly denotes a specific stereoisomer with absolute configurations (*R* and *S*) at its chiral centers. The designation of a single enantiomer confirms that the molecule is chiral and, by itself, is optically active.\n*   ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2*R*,3*S*) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers and are optically inactive due to internal compensation.\n*   ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This stereoisomer also has two chiral centers. Unlike the *meso* form, the (2*R*,3*R*) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and this specific enantiomer is optically active. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2*S*,3*S*) isomer.\n*   ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The designation (*R*) specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups (a hydroxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different carbon pathways within the ring). Therefore, it is optically active.\n*   ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The notation (1*s*,3*s*,5*s*) is synonymous with *cis,cis*-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, indicating that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry, including multiple planes of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An examination of this molecule's structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon atoms in the cyclopentyl ring and the butyl chain are not bonded to four different groups. The molecule is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3a*R*,7a*S*,*E*)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2*R*,3*R*)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (*R*)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the compounds listed will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral and present as a single enantiomer (or an excess of one). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically requires the presence of one or more stereocenters and the absence of any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This is an alkene. The molecule is planar about the C=C double bond. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name explicitly defines a single stereoisomer with specific configurations (3aR, 7aS, E). This indicates that the molecule is chiral and is present as a single enantiomer (or diastereomer). Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that passes between C2 and C3. This is a classic example of a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso form above. The (2R, 3R) configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The carbon atom at position 1 (bearing the -OH group) is a stereocenter. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. As this is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** The 's' notation (from cis/trans nomenclature, similar to R/S but for relative stereochemistry) indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all axial or all equatorial in a chair conformation). This molecule possesses a C3 axis of rotation and three planes of symmetry, making it highly symmetric and achiral. It is optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** The structure is a ketone: (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. There are no stereocenters in this molecule. The carbon in the isobutyl group bonded to two methyl groups is not chiral, and no carbons in the cyclopentyl ring or the rest of the chain are chiral. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (Yes)\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (Yes)\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol (Yes)\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer**: My goal is to determine the number of optically active compounds from the provided list. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. I will assess each compound for the presence of chiral centers and the absence of internal symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) that would render it achiral (meso).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is planar around the C=C double bond. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the compound achiral and thus not optically active.\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself provides the specific stereochemical configuration (3aR, 7aS). This indicates that the molecule is a single, specific enantiomer of a chiral compound. Therefore, it is optically active.\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule possesses two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration creates a plane of symmetry within the molecule, situated between the two chiral carbons. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and not optically active.\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The (2R, 3R) configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and this specific form is one of two enantiomers ((2R,3R) and (2S,3S)). Therefore, it is optically active.\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The designation (R) specifies the absolute configuration at the C1 carbon, which is a chiral center. This name refers to a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, which is optically active.\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has three stereocenters. However, the all-cis configuration (indicated by 1s,3s,5s) results in a highly symmetric molecule. It possesses three planes of symmetry, each passing through one hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon atom. Due to these symmetry planes, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: A thorough examination of this molecule's structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butyl chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. The molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n\nIn summary, three of the compounds are optically active: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, and (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.\n\n**Skeptic**: The analysis seems correct, but the conclusions for meso compounds and other symmetric molecules are critical and can be tricky. I want to double-check the reasoning for the molecules determined to be achiral.\n\n*   For **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**, a Fischer projection confirms the plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, making it a classic meso compound. This is correct.\n*   For **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**, the all-cis arrangement indeed creates planes of symmetry, making it achiral. This is correct.\n*   For **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**, the planarity of the double bond region creates a plane of symmetry for the whole molecule. This is correct.\n*   For **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**, the absence of any carbon atom bonded to four different groups is correctly identified. The molecule is achiral. This is correct.\n\nThe molecules explicitly named as a single enantiomer ((R), or a specific combination like (3aR,7aS)) are by definition chiral and optically active. The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Decision**: The debate converges. The initial analysis is correct. There are three optically active compounds in the list. I will now output the final answer.\n\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is a non-superimposable mirror image of itself. This typically occurs in molecules that lack an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The analysis of each compound is as follows:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is achiral. The atoms connected by the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane, which acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This compound is optically active. The stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS) in its name indicate that it is a specific, single enantiomer of a chiral molecule.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound is achiral. Although it has two chiral centers, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are not optically active.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound is optically active. Unlike its meso diastereomer, the (2R, 3R) configuration lacks a plane of symmetry and is chiral.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This compound is optically active. The (R) designation indicates a specific enantiomer at a chiral center (the carbon bearing the -OH group), confirming its chirality.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is achiral. The all-cis configuration (1s,3s,5s) gives the molecule planes of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image and thus not optically active.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This compound is achiral. It does not contain any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). Therefore, it is not optically active.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.

The analysis of the seven compounds based on this principle is as follows:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is achiral because the atoms around the double bond are planar, creating a plane of symmetry. It is **optically inactive**.\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This molecule is chiral.

It is **optically active**.\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule is achiral. Despite having two chiral centers, the (2R,3S) configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. It is **optically inactive**.\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule is chiral. It is a diastereomer of the meso form and lacks internal symmetry. As a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This molecule is chiral. The name specifies a single enantiomer (R) at a chiral center.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This often occurs when a carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, creating a chiral center. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a double bond, and the atoms involved in the double bond lie in a plane. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and, therefore, optically inactive.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS), which specify a particular three-dimensional arrangement of atoms. This indicates that the molecule is chiral and is present as a single enantiomer, not a mixture. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This compound has two chiral centers (at carbons 2 and 3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. Such compounds are called meso compounds, and they are achiral and optically inactive despite having chiral centers.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule also has two chiral centers. The (2R, 3R) configuration is one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being 2S, 3S). This molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is chiral. As it is specified as a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The (R) designation indicates a specific configuration at the chiral center (carbon 1), which is bonded to four different groups. Since a single enantiomer is specified, the compound is optically active.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** An examination of this molecule's structure reveals that it does not contain any chiral centers. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most often caused by the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The carbons of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The molecule as a whole is planar and therefore has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex bicyclic compound includes stereochemical descriptors \"(3aR,7aS)\". These indicate the presence of specific configurations at chiral centers. A molecule with chiral centers is chiral and thus optically active, unless it is a meso compound (which has an internal plane of symmetry). The specification of a single enantiomer confirms its chiral nature. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the molecule is symmetrical, with a carboxylic acid group at each end. The (2R,3S) configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry between the two chiral carbons. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. It has two chiral centers, but the (2R,3R) configuration does not result in an internal plane of symmetry. The molecule is chiral and its mirror image is the non-superimposable (2S,3S) enantiomer. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different carbon pathways around the ring (-CH=CH- and -CH2-CH2-). This makes C1 a chiral center. The \"(R)\" designation indicates that this is a specific enantiomer. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one of the C-OH bonds and the opposite CH2 group bisects the molecule into two identical halves. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: To determine if this compound is chiral, we look for chiral centers or other elements of chirality. The structure is (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that includes the cyclopentyl ring and the carbonyl group, bisecting the isobutyl group. Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nIn summary, three of the compounds listed will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and not a meso compound (an achiral compound with stereocenters). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ** (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The carbons of the double bond are sp2 hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. There are no other chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule is planar with respect to the double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\n2.  ** (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name itself specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer with defined configurations (R and S) at its chiral centers. The presence of these stereochemical descriptors indicates that the molecule is chiral. As a specific enantiomer, it will be optically active.\n\n3.  ** (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with a plane of symmetry between these two carbons, where one half is the mirror image of the other. This is a classic example of a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is not optically active.\n\n4.  ** (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule also has two chiral centers. The (2R,3R) configuration is diastereomeric to the meso form. This isomer is chiral and its mirror image, the (2S,3S) isomer, is non-superimposable. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ** (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at carbon 1, which is a chiral center. The molecule is designated as a single enantiomer, which means it is chiral and will be optically active.\n\n6.  ** (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This compound is also known as cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol. The three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and the opposing CH2 group on the ring. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n\n7.  ** 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** This ketone does not contain any chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized. All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are bonded to two hydrogens (or two other carbons in the ring), and the isobutyl group also lacks a chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary, three of the compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture. The compounds given with specific stereochemical descriptors (like R, S) are considered as single enantiomers, which are optically active if the molecule is chiral.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Chirality:** A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Chiral Center:** A common source of chirality is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Elements of Symmetry:** A molecule is achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n*   **Meso Compounds:** These are achiral molecules that contain chiral centers. They are achiral due to an internal element of symmetry.\n*   **Stereochemical Descriptors (R/S):** If a name includes R/S descriptors, it refers to a specific stereoisomer. If this stereoisomer is one of a pair of enantiomers, it is optically active. If it describes a meso compound, it is optically inactive.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms attached to the double bond carbons (C1 and C2) lie in the same plane.\n        ```\n            Cl   CH3\n             \\ /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n            H   CH2CH3\n        ```\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral. It has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)` specify a single, unique stereoisomer. The presence of `R` and `S` confirms the existence of chiral centers. The parent structure without the `=CHCl` group is a meso compound, but the substituent on the methano-bridge (C8) destroys all planes of symmetry. Since the molecule has chiral centers and lacks internal symmetry, it is chiral. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereochemistry is specified as `(2R,3S)`. This particular combination of stereocenters results in a molecule with a plane of symmetry that lies between C2 and C3.\n        ```\n              COOH\n              |\n        H --- C --- CH3\n        ------|------  <-- Plane of symmetry\n        CH3 -- C --- H\n              |\n              COOH\n        (A possible conformation with a plane of symmetry)\n        ```\n    *   A molecule with chiral centers but also an internal plane of symmetry is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereochemistry is specified as `(2R,3R)`. This stereoisomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are a pair of enantiomers. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond and an alcohol group.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at C1. The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH=CH- (part of the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (part of the ring). Therefore, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and the `(R)` designation refers to a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** This highly symmetrical molecule possesses three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one carbon bearing an -OH group and the carbon atom directly opposite it (e.g., a plane containing C1 and C4). The presence of even one plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The IUPAC name describes the following structure: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to check for any chiral centers or other elements of chirality. The only potential chiral center in the chain is C3, but it is bonded to two identical methyl groups (`(CH3)2CH-`), so it is not a chiral center. The cyclopentyl ring is also symmetrically attached. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the `H-C3-C2-C1=O` atoms and bisects the two methyl groups on C3 and the cyclopentyl ring. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Count**\n\nLet's summarize which compounds are optically active:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Active**\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not a meso compound. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is typically due to the presence of one or more chiral centers. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a double bond, and the atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name of this compound specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer using the (3aR,7aS) designation. This indicates the presence of chiral centers and that we are considering a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule possesses two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. Such a compound is called a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers and is thus optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This stereoisomer of dimethylsuccinic acid is a chiral molecule. It is the enantiomer of the (2S,3S) form and does not have an internal plane of symmetry. As a specific enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups (a hydroxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different carbon pathways within the ring), making it a chiral center. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer and therefore optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** In this molecule, all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** To determine if this molecule is chiral, we look for chiral centers. The structure is (CH₃)₂CHCH₂C(=O)C₅H₉. The carbon atom in the `CH` group is bonded to two identical methyl (CH₃) groups, so it is not a chiral center. There are no other chiral centers in the molecule, and it lacks any other elements of chirality, making it optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nMy initial analysis and the code output have a discrepancy. Let's re-evaluate the compounds one by one. The key concept is that a compound is optically active if and only if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of stereocenters (chiral centers) often leads to chirality, but if a molecule with stereocenters has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is achiral and called a meso compound.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. This molecule is planar around the double bond. It has no chiral centers. The plane of the molecule is a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name explicitly gives the absolute configuration of a specific stereoisomer using (R), (S), and (E) descriptors. When a single, specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is isolated, it is by definition optically active. This complex molecule lacks any symmetry elements, so it is chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are identical to the substituents on C3. When two such identical stereocenters in a molecule have opposite configurations (one R, one S), the molecule is a meso compound. A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it achiral despite the presence of stereocenters. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**. The initial python code was flawed in its logic, as it incorrectly identified any molecule with R/S centers as active, failing to account for meso compounds. My manual analysis was correct.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. Here, the two identical stereocenters have the same configuration (both R). This molecule lacks any internal symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image (the (2S,3S) isomer). Therefore, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1) is a stereocenter. It is bonded to -H, -OH, and two different paths around the ring (`-CH2-CH=CH-` and `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single chiral molecule. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses three planes of symmetry, each passing through a C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond. Due to these symmetry planes, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. A careful examination reveals no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers. The molecule also has a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group and the isobutyl group, bisecting the cyclopentyl ring. Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary of optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn optically active compound is a chiral compound that is present in a non-racemic form (i.e., as a single enantiomer or an unequal mixture of enantiomers). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks any improper axis of rotation (which includes planes of symmetry and centers of inversion).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. The atoms around the C=C double bond lie in a single plane. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral. Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E), which specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer. The complex and asymmetric structure of the molecule's carbon framework, along with the `8-(chloromethylene)` substituent, ensures that the molecule lacks internal symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is chiral. Since a specific single stereoisomer (an enantiomer or a diastereomer) is named, it is not a racemic mixture. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric, as the groups attached to C2 are the same as those attached to C3. The (2R,3S) stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry that passes between C2 and C3 (in an eclipsed conformation) or a center of inversion (in a staggered conformation). A compound with chiral centers that is achiral overall due to internal symmetry is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers form an enantiomeric pair. They are chiral because they lack any internal symmetry elements and are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. The name specifies the (2R,3R) enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. The carbon atom bearing the -OH group (C1) is a chiral center because the two paths around the ring from this carbon are different (`-CH2-CH=CH-` vs. `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: For the carbons C1, C3, and C5 to be stereocenters that can be assigned a configuration (like 's' or 'r'), the molecule must be chiral. If the molecule were the all-cis isomer (where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring), it would be achiral (meso) due to a plane of symmetry. In such a symmetric molecule, C1, C3, and C5 are prochiral, not true chiral centers. Therefore, the name `(1s,3s,5s)` must refer to a chiral isomer, such as one where two -OH groups are cis and one is trans (e.g., up, up, down). Such an isomer is chiral. The name specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral compound. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two methyl groups (`-CH3` and the terminal `CH3` of the chain), and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. No other carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n\nThere are a total of 4 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine how many of the compounds are optically active, we need to assess each one for chirality.

However, it does not contain any chiral centers (a carbon atom with four different substituents). The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that includes the double bond, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)*-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this compound includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E), which specify a particular stereoisomer. The presence of these \"R\" and \"S\" designations indicates the existence of chiral centers. A specific enantiomer like this is, by definition, chiral and will exhibit optical activity.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with a plane of symmetry between these two centers. The substituents on one side of the plane are a mirror image of the substituents on the other. This type of compound is called a \"meso\" compound. Despite having chiral centers, meso compounds are achiral overall and thus optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound also has two chiral centers. Unlike its meso counterpart, the (2R, 3R) configuration does not have a plane of symmetry. This molecule is chiral and will be optically active. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S, 3S) enantiomer.\n\n5.  ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The \"(R)\" in the name indicates that this is a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The chiral center is the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1). This carbon is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, the hydroxyl group, a -CH=CH- group within the ring, and a -CH2-CH2- group within the ring. As a specific enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has the three hydroxyl groups in a cis configuration, meaning they are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and the carbon opposite to it, bisecting the ring. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: To determine if this molecule is chiral, we must look for a chiral center. The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon, which is bonded to a butyl chain with a methyl group at position 3. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl group, and two identical methyl groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no chiral centers and is achiral, making it optically inactive.\n\nIn summary:\n*   Optically active: **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**, **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**, and **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**.\n*   Optically inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, and 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.\n\nTherefore, 3 of the compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not a meso compound. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This analysis determines the optical activity for each of the seven compounds listed.\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond and no chiral centers. The molecule itself is achiral as the plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry, making it optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS), which specify the three-dimensional arrangement at chiral centers. The presence of these descriptors for a specific, complex molecule indicates that it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound and is therefore optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the molecule is symmetrical, and the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a plane of symmetry. This specific stereoisomer is a meso compound, which is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the compound above. The (2R, 3R) configuration lacks a plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image (the 2S, 3S isomer). Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name explicitly indicates the (R) configuration at a chiral center. The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1) is attached to four different groups, making it a chiral center. As a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (*cis*). This arrangement gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry, including multiple planes of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this ketone is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. An examination of the structure reveals that there are no chiral centers. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, three of the compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we must assess each one for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic (50:50) mixture of enantiomers. Generally, a molecule is chiral if it lacks an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\nHere is the analysis of each compound:\n\n*   ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule lacks a chiral center. The carbon atoms of the double bond are each bonded to only two different groups, and the other carbons in the chain do not have four different substituents. The molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n*   ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name explicitly denotes a specific stereoisomer with absolute configurations (*R* and *S*) at its chiral centers. The designation of a single enantiomer confirms that the molecule is chiral and, by itself, is optically active.\n*   ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2*R*,3*S*) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers and are optically inactive due to internal compensation.\n*   ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This stereoisomer also has two chiral centers. Unlike the *meso* form, the (2*R*,3*R*) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and this specific enantiomer is optically active. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2*S*,3*S*) isomer.\n*   ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The designation (*R*) specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups (a hydroxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different carbon pathways within the ring). Therefore, it is optically active.\n*   ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The notation (1*s*,3*s*,5*s*) is synonymous with *cis,cis*-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, indicating that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry, including multiple planes of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An examination of this molecule's structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon atoms in the cyclopentyl ring and the butyl chain are not bonded to four different groups. The molecule is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3a*R*,7a*S*,*E*)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2*R*,3*R*)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (*R*)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the compounds listed will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral and present as a single enantiomer (or an excess of one). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically requires the presence of one or more stereocenters and the absence of any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This is an alkene. The molecule is planar about the C=C double bond. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name explicitly defines a single stereoisomer with specific configurations (3aR, 7aS, E). This indicates that the molecule is chiral and is present as a single enantiomer (or diastereomer). Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that passes between C2 and C3. This is a classic example of a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso form above. The (2R, 3R) configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The carbon atom at position 1 (bearing the -OH group) is a stereocenter. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. As this is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** The 's' notation (from cis/trans nomenclature, similar to R/S but for relative stereochemistry) indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all axial or all equatorial in a chair conformation). This molecule possesses a C3 axis of rotation and three planes of symmetry, making it highly symmetric and achiral. It is optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** The structure is a ketone: (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. There are no stereocenters in this molecule. The carbon in the isobutyl group bonded to two methyl groups is not chiral, and no carbons in the cyclopentyl ring or the rest of the chain are chiral. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (Yes)\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (Yes)\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol (Yes)\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer**: My goal is to determine the number of optically active compounds from the provided list. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. I will assess each compound for the presence of chiral centers and the absence of internal symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) that would render it achiral (meso).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is planar around the C=C double bond. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the compound achiral and thus not optically active.\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself provides the specific stereochemical configuration (3aR, 7aS). This indicates that the molecule is a single, specific enantiomer of a chiral compound. Therefore, it is optically active.\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule possesses two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration creates a plane of symmetry within the molecule, situated between the two chiral carbons. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and not optically active.\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The (2R, 3R) configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and this specific form is one of two enantiomers ((2R,3R) and (2S,3S)). Therefore, it is optically active.\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The designation (R) specifies the absolute configuration at the C1 carbon, which is a chiral center. This name refers to a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, which is optically active.\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has three stereocenters. However, the all-cis configuration (indicated by 1s,3s,5s) results in a highly symmetric molecule. It possesses three planes of symmetry, each passing through one hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon atom. Due to these symmetry planes, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: A thorough examination of this molecule's structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butyl chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. The molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n\nIn summary, three of the compounds are optically active: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, and (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.\n\n**Skeptic**: The analysis seems correct, but the conclusions for meso compounds and other symmetric molecules are critical and can be tricky. I want to double-check the reasoning for the molecules determined to be achiral.\n\n*   For **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**, a Fischer projection confirms the plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, making it a classic meso compound. This is correct.\n*   For **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**, the all-cis arrangement indeed creates planes of symmetry, making it achiral. This is correct.\n*   For **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**, the planarity of the double bond region creates a plane of symmetry for the whole molecule. This is correct.\n*   For **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**, the absence of any carbon atom bonded to four different groups is correctly identified. The molecule is achiral. This is correct.\n\nThe molecules explicitly named as a single enantiomer ((R), or a specific combination like (3aR,7aS)) are by definition chiral and optically active. The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Decision**: The debate converges. The initial analysis is correct. There are three optically active compounds in the list. I will now output the final answer.\n\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is a non-superimposable mirror image of itself. This typically occurs in molecules that lack an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The analysis of each compound is as follows:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is achiral. The atoms connected by the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane, which acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This compound is optically active. The stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS) in its name indicate that it is a specific, single enantiomer of a chiral molecule.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound is achiral. Although it has two chiral centers, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are not optically active.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound is optically active. Unlike its meso diastereomer, the (2R, 3R) configuration lacks a plane of symmetry and is chiral.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This compound is optically active. The (R) designation indicates a specific enantiomer at a chiral center (the carbon bearing the -OH group), confirming its chirality.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is achiral. The all-cis configuration (1s,3s,5s) gives the molecule planes of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image and thus not optically active.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This compound is achiral. It does not contain any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). Therefore, it is not optically active.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.
