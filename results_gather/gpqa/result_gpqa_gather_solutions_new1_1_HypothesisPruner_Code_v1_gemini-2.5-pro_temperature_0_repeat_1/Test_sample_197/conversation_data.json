The formation of these complexes is governed by their overall stability constants (β).\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free metal ion and all the complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the stability constants, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe fraction (α₂) of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is given by:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the complex concentrations, the [Co²⁺] term cancels out, leading to the following formula for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nGiven the values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nWe can calculate each term in the denominator:\n*   1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe sum of these terms (the denominator) is:\n1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)₂] complex:\nβ₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, we calculate the fraction and convert it to a percentage:\nPercentage = (0.4 / 2.3646) × 100 ≈ 16.916%\n\nRounding to one decimal place gives 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species, we can use the provided stability constants and the concentration of the thiocyanate ligand.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all the thiocyanato complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion, [Co²⁺], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe percentage of a specific complex, in this case [Co(SCN)₂], is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100. The formula for the mole fraction (α₂) of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe percentage is simply this fraction multiplied by 100. The total cobalt concentration, c(Co), is not needed for this calculation as the [Co²⁺] term cancels out.\n\nGiven the values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nWe can calculate the terms for the denominator:\n*   1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe sum of these terms (the denominator) is:\n1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)₂] complex:\nβ₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = (0.4 / 2.3646) × 100 ≈ 16.916%\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we first need to calculate the mole fraction of this species relative to all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nBy substituting these into the equation for the total cobalt concentration, we get:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = ( [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) ) * 100\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = ( β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² / [Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100\n\nThe term [Co²⁺] cancels out, so the total cobalt concentration of 10⁻² M is not needed for this specific calculation. We can now substitute the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the denominator (let's call it D):\nD = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNext, let's calculate the value of the numerator term for our complex of interest (β₂[SCN⁻]²):\nNumerator = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage:\nPercentage = (0.4 / 2.3646) × 100 ≈ 16.916%\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\n*   We have a solution containing Cobalt(II) ions (`Co²⁺`) and thiocyanate ions (`SCN⁻`).\n*   These ions react to form a series of complexes: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`.\n*   The goal is to find the percentage of one specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]` (the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex), relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n\n*   Total Cobalt Concentration, `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M\n*   Thiocyanate Concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   Overall Stability Constants (β):\n    *   `β₁ = 9` for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   `β₂ = 40` for `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n    *   `β₃ = 63` for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n    *   `β₄ = 16` for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**3. Define the Species in Solution**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free cobalt ion and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**4. Express Complex Concentrations using Stability Constants**\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the corresponding stability constant `βn`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**5. Formulate the Expression for the Total Cobalt Concentration**\n\nSubstitute the expressions from Step 4 into the equation from Step 3:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nFactor out the common term `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**6. Formulate the Expression for the Percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]`**\n\nThe percentage of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is given by:\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) ) * 100%`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` and `c(Co)`:\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)) ) * 100%`\n\n**7. Simplify the Expression**\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This is a crucial simplification.\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100%`\n\n**8. Careful Point: Ligand Concentration**\n\nThe problem states `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. We must consider if this is the *total* or *free* (equilibrium) concentration. The total cobalt concentration (0.01 M) is ten times smaller than the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). This means the ligand is in large excess, and the amount of `SCN⁻` that binds to `Co²⁺` will be small compared to the total amount of `SCN⁻`. Therefore, we can safely approximate the free ligand concentration at equilibrium as the given concentration.\n*   **Assumption:** `[SCN⁻]` (free) ≈ 0.1 M.\n\n**9. Calculation**\n\nLet's calculate the value of the denominator first. Let `L = [SCN⁻] = 0.1`.\n*   `β₁ * L¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β₂ * L² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃ * L³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄ * L⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate the value of the numerator:\nNumerator = `β₂ * L² = 0.4`\n\nFinally, calculate the fraction and the percentage:\nFraction = `Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\n**10.

The model's constraints and the resulting calculation were validated as correct. The final answer is confirmed.\n\nPlease provide the next question.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer:** The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This can be determined by calculating the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free Co(II) ions and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]`\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, and the free thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN⁻]`:\n`[Co(SCN)ₙ] = βₙ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ`\n\nThe fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. The `[Co²⁺]` term will cancel out from the numerator and the denominator.\n\nThe formula for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (α₂) is:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nMy proposed action is to substitute the given values into this formula and calculate the result. I do not need to perform a search.\n\n**Skeptic:** Your proposed formula is correct for this type of calculation. However, I have some points to consider:\n1.  The problem provides the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, which is not used in your formula. Could this value be important? It might imply that the consumption of the thiocyanate ligand by complex formation is significant, meaning the equilibrium concentration of `[SCN⁻]` is not the stated 0.1 M.\n2.  The notation `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` typically refers to the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand in the solution. If this is the case, your formula is correct, and the total cobalt concentration is extraneous information, possibly included to test understanding.\n3.  Let's assume the standard interpretation that `[SCN⁻]` is the equilibrium concentration. The calculation then depends entirely on the correct application of the formula and accurate arithmetic. A small error could lead to selecting the wrong multiple-choice option.\n\n**Decision:** The most standard and direct interpretation of the problem is that `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` is the equilibrium concentration of the free thiocyanate ligand. In this scenario, the Proposer's formula is the correct path forward. The total cobalt concentration is not needed to calculate the percentage distribution of the species. The next and final action is to perform the calculation.\n\nLet's calculate the denominator (D) of the fraction:\nD = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\nD = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator (N), which corresponds to the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex term:\nN = β₂ * [SCN⁻]²\nN = 40 * (0.1)²\nN = 0.4\n\nThe fraction (α₂) is N / D:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Understand the System and the Goal**\n\n*   We have a solution containing Cobalt(II) ions (`Co²⁺`) and thiocyanate ions (`SCN⁻`).\n*   These ions react to form a series of complexes: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`.\n*   The goal is to find the percentage of one specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]` (the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex), relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n\n*   Total Cobalt Concentration, `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M\n*   Thiocyanate Concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   Overall Stability Constants (β):\n    *   `β₁ = 9` for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   `β₂ = 40` for `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n    *   `β₃ = 63` for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n    *   `β₄ = 16` for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**3. Define the Species in Solution**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free cobalt ion and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**4. Express Complex Concentrations using Stability Constants**\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the corresponding stability constant `βn`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**5. Formulate the Expression for the Total Cobalt Concentration**\n\nSubstitute the expressions from Step 4 into the equation from Step 3:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nFactor out the common term `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**6. Formulate the Expression for the Percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]`**\n\nThe percentage of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is given by:\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) ) * 100%`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` and `c(Co)`:\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)) ) * 100%`\n\n**7. Simplify the Expression**\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This is a crucial simplification.\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100%`\n\n**8. Careful Point: Ligand Concentration**\n\nThe problem states `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. We must consider if this is the *total* or *free* (equilibrium) concentration. The total cobalt concentration (0.01 M) is ten times smaller than the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). This means the ligand is in large excess, and the amount of `SCN⁻` that binds to `Co²⁺` will be small compared to the total amount of `SCN⁻`. Therefore, we can safely approximate the free ligand concentration at equilibrium as the given concentration.\n*   **Assumption:** `[SCN⁻]` (free) ≈ 0.1 M.\n\n**9. Calculation**\n\nLet's calculate the value of the denominator first. Let `L = [SCN⁻] = 0.1`.\n*   `β₁ * L¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β₂ * L² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃ * L³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄ * L⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate the value of the numerator:\nNumerator = `β₂ * L² = 0.4`\n\nFinally, calculate the fraction and the percentage:\nFraction = `Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\n**10.

The model's constraints and the resulting calculation were validated as correct. The final answer is confirmed.\n\nPlease provide the next question.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer:** The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This can be determined by calculating the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free Co(II) ions and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]`\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, and the free thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN⁻]`:\n`[Co(SCN)ₙ] = βₙ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ`\n\nThe fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. The `[Co²⁺]` term will cancel out from the numerator and the denominator.\n\nThe formula for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (α₂) is:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nMy proposed action is to substitute the given values into this formula and calculate the result. I do not need to perform a search.\n\n**Skeptic:** Your proposed formula is correct for this type of calculation. However, I have some points to consider:\n1.  The problem provides the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, which is not used in your formula. Could this value be important? It might imply that the consumption of the thiocyanate ligand by complex formation is significant, meaning the equilibrium concentration of `[SCN⁻]` is not the stated 0.1 M.\n2.  The notation `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` typically refers to the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand in the solution. If this is the case, your formula is correct, and the total cobalt concentration is extraneous information, possibly included to test understanding.\n3.  Let's assume the standard interpretation that `[SCN⁻]` is the equilibrium concentration. The calculation then depends entirely on the correct application of the formula and accurate arithmetic. A small error could lead to selecting the wrong multiple-choice option.\n\n**Decision:** The most standard and direct interpretation of the problem is that `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` is the equilibrium concentration of the free thiocyanate ligand. In this scenario, the Proposer's formula is the correct path forward. The total cobalt concentration is not needed to calculate the percentage distribution of the species. The next and final action is to perform the calculation.\n\nLet's calculate the denominator (D) of the fraction:\nD = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\nD = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator (N), which corresponds to the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex term:\nN = β₂ * [SCN⁻]²\nN = 40 * (0.1)²\nN = 0.4\n\nThe fraction (α₂) is N / D:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",
