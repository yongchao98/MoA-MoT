    "This question asks to identify which of the given compounds are optically active. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and present as a single enantiomer or in an enantiomerically enriched mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature causing chirality is a stereocenter, but the overall molecular symmetry determines chirality.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   This molecule contains a C=C double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C from methyl, C from ethyl) lie in a single plane.\n    *   A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. There are no such sp3-hybridized carbons in this molecule.\n    *   Since the molecule is planar, it possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3a and 7a). The descriptor `(E)` specifies the geometry of the chloromethylene (`=CH-Cl`) double bond.\n    *   The presence of stereochemical descriptors like `R` and `S` in the name of a compound indicates that a specific stereoisomer is being referred to.\n    *   While some molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral (meso compounds), this is usually due to a high degree of symmetry. The parent skeleton, `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione`, can be meso. However, the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` is asymmetric (`=CH-Cl`). This substituent breaks any pre-existing plane of symmetry in the parent molecule.\n    *   The molecule is therefore chiral. By specifying a single stereoisomer (`3aR,7aS,E`), the name refers to a pure enantiomer (or diastereomer if other chiral centers exist), which is optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule is symmetric because the two ends are identical (COOH groups).\n    *   Let's consider the stereoisomers. There are the enantiomeric pair (2R,3R) and (2S,3S), and the diastereomer (2R,3S).\n    *   The (2R,3S) isomer has opposite configurations at its two stereocenters. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the (2R,3S) isomer possesses a center of inversion (in its anti-periplanar conformation) and a plane of symmetry (in its eclipsed conformation). This makes it a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds are achiral, even though they have stereocenters, because they are superimposable on their mirror image. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) isomer is chiral. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, and they are non-superimposable.\n    *   Since (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and an OH group at C1.\n    *   Let's examine C1. It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -OH group\n        2.  -H atom\n        3.  The ring segment `-CH2-CH=` (path C1-C2-C3)\n        4.  The ring segment `-CH=CH-CH2-` (path C1-C6-C5-C4)\n    *   Since the four groups are different, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` indicates the relative stereochemistry, implying all three OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's check the carbons C1, C3, and C5. For C1, the two paths around the ring, -C2-C3(OH)-C4-C5(OH)-C6- and -C6-C5(OH)-C4-C3(OH)-C2-, are identical. Thus, C1 is not a stereocenter (it is a prochiral center). The same applies to C3 and C5.\n    *   The molecule has high symmetry. Specifically, the all-cis isomer possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond.\n    *   Due to these elements of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The IUPAC name describes a ketone. `...butan-1-one` attached to a `cyclopentyl` group means the structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-(chain)`. The chain is `3-methylbutyl`.\n    *   The acid `3-methylbutanoic acid` is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-COOH`.\n    *   So, the ketone has the structure `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. This is also known as cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone.\n    *   Let's check for stereocenters. The carbon in `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to a hydrogen, a `CH2` group, and two identical `CH3` groups. It is not a stereocenter. The cyclopentyl ring is attached to an achiral group. The molecule as a whole is flexible and possesses conformations with a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have identified the following optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
