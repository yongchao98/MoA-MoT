    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the reaction and the question.**\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings. We need to arrange the starting substances in order of increasing yield of the para-brominated product. The \"weight fraction of the yield\" is generally taken to mean the mole percentage of the para-isomer among all the monobrominated products.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  ะก6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n2.  C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents.**\nThe substituent on the benzene ring directs the incoming electrophile (Br+) to specific positions. We classify them as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the bromination primarily to the ortho and para positions. They typically result in a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   -CH3 (Alkyl group): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   -C2H5 (Alkyl group): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   -Cl (Halogen): Deactivating, but o,p-director.\n    *   Substances: **1, 3, 5** will give high yields of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups are deactivating and direct the bromination primarily to the meta position. The yield of the ortho and para isomers is very low.\n    *   -NO2 (Nitro group): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   -COOH (Carboxylic acid group): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   -COOC2H5 (Ester group): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   Substances: **2, 4, 6** will give very low yields of the para-isomer.\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the order will be {2, 4, 6} < {1, 3, 5}.\n\n**Step 3: Order the meta-directors (substances 2, 4, 6).**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield will be inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more strongly deactivating group will make the ortho and para positions even less reactive, leading to an even lower yield of the para product.\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is strongly deactivating.\n*   The ester group (-COOC2H5) is also strongly deactivating, but slightly less so than -COOH because of the weak electron-donating effect of the ethyl group.\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will increase in the opposite order:\nYield(p-Br-Nitrobenzene) < Yield(p-Br-Benzoic acid) < Yield(p-Br-Ethyl benzoate)\nThis corresponds to the order of substances: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the ortho, para-directors (substances 1, 3, 5).**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. We need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This ratio is primarily influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Toluene (1, -CH3):** The methyl group is small, so ortho attack is quite feasible. The typical para-isomer yield in bromination is around 67%.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increases steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making the para position more favorable. Therefore, the percentage of the para-isomer will be higher for ethylbenzene than for toluene. So, para yield (5) > para yield (1).\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** The chloro group is deactivating overall due to its strong inductive electron-withdrawal (-I effect), but it directs ortho/para due to its resonance electron-donation (+R effect). The -I effect is distance-dependent and significantly deactivates the adjacent ortho positions more than the distant para position. This strong electronic factor makes chlorobenzene highly selective for the para position, often more so than alkylbenzenes. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is typically very high, around 89-91%.\n\nComparing the three:\n*   Para yield(1) is the lowest (baseline, ~67%).\n*   Para yield(5) is higher than (1) due to increased steric hindrance.\n*   Para yield(3) is the highest (~89-91%) due to the strong deactivating inductive effect at the ortho position, making it the most selective for the para position among the three.\n\nThis gives the order of increasing para-isomer yield: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the two groups.**\nCombining the orders from Step 3 and Step 4 gives the final overall order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
