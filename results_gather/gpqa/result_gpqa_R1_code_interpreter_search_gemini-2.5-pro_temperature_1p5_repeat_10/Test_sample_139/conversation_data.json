    "Here is my thinking process to solve this chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** I'll break down the user's prompt into individual chemical clues to solve the identity of Substance X.\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.** This is a direct hint that we are dealing with a compound containing an isotope like Deuterium (D), ¹³C, ¹⁵N, etc.\n\n    *   **Clue 6: The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.** 277 Kelvin is 3.85°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), where hydrogen is replaced by its heavier isotope Deuterium, is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is an extremely strong match.\n        *   Therefore, **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n        *   This confirms the heavier isotope mentioned in Clue 1 is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).** This means G is a deuterated hydrate, i.e., a compound that has D₂O molecules in its structure or, more likely, a metal deuteroxide that dehydrates upon heating to form a metal oxide and D₂O. For example, a metal deuteroxide `M(OD)n` would decompose upon heating: `2M(OD)n -> M₂On + nD₂O`.\n\n    *   **Clue 2 & 3: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.**\n        *   Since D₂O is involved, it's highly probable that the liquid **Y is also D₂O**.\n        *   Let's analyze potential gases (W) with equal protons (p) and neutrons (n):\n            *   Deuterium gas (D₂): Each D has 1p and 1n. D₂ has **2p and 2n**. This is a perfect candidate.\n            *   Nitrogen gas (¹⁴N₂): Each ¹⁴N has 7p and 7n. N₂ has **14p and 14n**. This is possible.\n            *   Carbon monoxide (¹²C¹⁶O): C has 6p, 6n. O has 8p, 8n. CO has **14p, 14n**. This is possible.\n        *   A reaction between an unknown substance X and D₂O that produces D₂ gas is very common for metal deuterides: `MDx + xD₂O -> M(OD)x + xD₂`. This reaction type fits the clues. The \"violently\" part suggests a very reactive deuteride.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G forms.** In the reaction `MDx + xD₂O -> M(OD)x + xD₂`, the product **G would be the metal deuteroxide, M(OD)x**. For G to be a precipitate, M(OD)x must be insoluble in D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 8: Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.** This is a huge hint. Powerful reducing agents used in organic chemistry often come in deuterated forms for isotopic labeling studies. Common examples include Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n\n    *   **Clue 7: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.** A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Both functional groups are reduced by strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄.\n        *   Ketone: `>C=O` is reduced to `>CH-OH`.\n        *   Carboxylic acid: `-COOH` is reduced to `-CH₂-OH`.\n        *   So, a keto acid is reduced to a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups). The resulting diol molecule still contains **2 atoms of oxygen**. This confirms X is a powerful reducing agent.\n\n2.  **Synthesize and Identify Substance X:**\n    Let's test our two main candidates, LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄.\n    *   **Candidate 1: LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride)**\n        *   **Reaction with D₂O:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4D₂↑`.\n        *   *Violent?* Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is famously violent.\n        *   *Gas W?* D₂ is produced.\n        *   *Precipitate G?* Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide) is a gelatinous precipitate, analogous to Al(OH)₃.\n        *   *G → B?* Heating `2Al(OD)₃` gives `Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. So B=D₂O.\n        *   *Organic Reagent?* Yes, LiAlD₄ and its analog LiAlH₄ are cornerstone reducing agents.\n        *   This is a perfect fit for all clues.\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: NaBD₄ (Sodium Borodeuteride)**\n        *   **Reaction with D₂O:** `NaBD₄ + 4D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂↑`.\n        *   *Violent?* The reaction of NaBH₄ is much milder and more controllable than LiAlH₄. This doesn't fit the \"violently\" clue as well.\n        *   *Precipitate G?* The products are NaOD (soluble) and B(OD)₃ (boric acid, soluble). It does not form a classic precipitate.\n        *   Since NaBD₄ does not fit the \"violently\" and \"precipitate\" clues as well as LiAlD₄, we can confidently eliminate it.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Substance X is LiAlD₄.**\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". In puzzles of this nature, \"atomic mass\" usually refers to the integer mass number of the most common/relevant isotope.\n\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest:**\n        *   Hydrogen (Atomic number Z=1) is the **lightest element**.\n        *   Aluminium (Atomic number Z=13) is the **heaviest element**.\n        *   Lithium (Z=3) is an intermediate element and should be ignored based on the phrasing of the question.\n\n    *   **Calculate Masses:**\n        *   **Mass from lightest element (Hydrogen):** The formula LiAlD₄ contains 4 atoms of Hydrogen, all as the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium (1 proton + 1 neutron) is 2.\n          *Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 atoms × 2 = 8.*\n        *   **Mass from heaviest element (Aluminium):** The formula contains 1 atom of Aluminium. The only stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27.\n          *Total mass from Aluminium = 1 atom × 27 = 27.*\n\n    *   **Sum the masses:**\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminium)\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
