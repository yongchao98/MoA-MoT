    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the initial state:**\n    The particle is spin-1/2 and is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the `Sz` operator. \"Aligned\" implies the spin projection is along the field, so it's in the \"spin-up\" state with respect to the Z-axis. We denote this state as `|+z>`. In the standard basis where the eigenvectors of `Sz` are `[[1], [0]]` for spin-up and `[[0], [1]]` for spin-down, we have:\n    `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z> = [[1], [0]]`\n\n2.  **Define the Hamiltonian for t > 0:**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with magnitude `B`. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `H = -μ ⋅ B`. The magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The spin operator `S` is given by `(ħ/2)σ`, where `σ` are the Pauli matrices.\n    The magnetic field is `B = (0, B, 0)`.\n    So, `S ⋅ B = Sx*0 + Sy*B + Sz*0 = B*Sy`.\n    The Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -γ(S ⋅ B) = -γB*Sy`.\n    The `Sy` operator is given by `Sy = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    So, `H = -γB(ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n3.  **Find the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian:**\n    The system will evolve according to this new Hamiltonian. The oscillation frequencies of expectation values are determined by the energy differences between the eigenstates of this Hamiltonian. The eigenstates of `H` are the same as the eigenstates of `Sy`.\n    Let's find the eigenvalues of `H`. The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    The corresponding energy eigenvalues are:\n    `E1 = -γB * (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n    `E2 = -γB * (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n    The energy difference between these two states is:\n    `ΔE = E2 - E1 = (γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n\n4.  **Determine the oscillation frequency:**\n    When a quantum system is in a superposition of energy eigenstates (which is the case here, as the initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of `Sy`), the expectation values of observables that don't commute with the Hamiltonian will oscillate. The angular frequency of this oscillation is given by the Bohr frequency rule: `ω = ΔE / ħ`.\n    `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n    This is the angular frequency of the Larmor precession of the spin around the new magnetic field direction (Y-axis).\n\n5.  **Confirm by calculating the expectation value:**\n    Let's explicitly calculate the expectation value of `μz` as a function of time.\n    First, we express the initial state `|+z>` in terms of the eigenstates of `Sy`, which we'll call `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    `|+y> = (1/√2) * [[1], [i]]` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2` for `Sy`)\n    `|-y> = (1/√2) * [[1], [-i]]` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2` for `Sy`)\n    We can write `|+z>` as a linear combination:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n\n    The time evolution of the state is given by `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)>`.\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * ( e^(-iE1*t/ħ)|+y> + e^(-iE2*t/ħ)|-y> )`\n    Substituting `E1 = -γBħ/2` and `E2 = +γBħ/2`, and letting `ω = γB`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * ( e^(-i(-ωħ/2)t/ħ)|+y> + e^(-i(ωħ/2)t/ħ)|-y> )`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * ( e^(iωt/2)|+y> + e^(-iωt/2)|-y> )`\n\n    Now, we want to calculate `<μz(t)> = γ<ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`.\n    We need to express `|ψ(t)>` back in the Z-basis.\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(iωt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + e^(-iωt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [ (e^(iωt/2) + e^(-iωt/2))|+z> + i(e^(iωt/2) - e^(-iωt/2))|-z> ]`\n    Using Euler's identities (`cos(x) = (e^(ix)+e^(-ix))/2`, `sin(x) = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/2i`):\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`\n\n    Now we calculate `<Sz(t)>`:\n    `<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`\n    `= [cos(ωt/2) <+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|] * Sz * [cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>]`\n    Since `Sz|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `Sz|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`,\n    `<Sz(t)> = [cos(ωt/2) <+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|] * [cos(ωt/2)(ħ/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)(-ħ/2)|-z>]`\n    `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`:\n    `<Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n    The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n    The value of `<μz(t)>` oscillates with a function `cos(ωt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\n    From our earlier definition, `ω = γB`.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
