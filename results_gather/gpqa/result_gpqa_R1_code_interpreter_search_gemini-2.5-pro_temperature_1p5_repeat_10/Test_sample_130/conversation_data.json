    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single 1H NMR peak at 7 ppm (alkene region) and two 13C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl C).\n        *   The single 1H peak indicates that the two alkene protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   The two 13C peaks indicate two types of equivalent carbons.\n        *   This data is perfectly consistent with **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by dehydrating *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, matching the NMR data.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   The structure is a five-membered ring with a CH₂ group at C5 and conjugated double bonds at C1=C2 and C3=C4. Each of the four sp² carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) bears a methyl group.\n        *   The molecular formula of the diene is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile.\n    *   The total molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions typically yield two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to these two isomers.\n    *   According to the **Alder endo rule**, the transition state leading to the *endo* product is kinetically favored due to secondary orbital interactions. Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* isomer**, and the **minor product is the *exo* isomer**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry and Structure of the Products:**\n    *   The product has a **bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene** core structure.\n    *   We need to determine the relative positions of the substituents in the *endo* and *exo* isomers to understand their 3D structure and predict NOESY correlations.\n    *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** In the *endo* transition state, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are positioned \"under\" the diene's π-system. In the resulting product, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the six-membered ring from the C7 bridge (the former CH₂ group of the diene). This means the two protons attached to the anhydride-derived part of the skeleton (let's call them H_anhydride, at positions C5 and C6) point *towards* the C7 bridge. They are also situated underneath the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** In the *exo* product, the anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge. The H_anhydride protons point *away* from the C7 bridge.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Assign Proton Signals and Evaluate Spatial Proximities:**\n    *   Based on typical chemical shifts, we can assign the signals mentioned in the options:\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Vinylic methyl groups on C2 and C3 (**Me_vinyl**). They are equivalent due to symmetry.\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Bridgehead methyl groups on C1 and C4 (**Me_bridgehead**). Also equivalent.\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Protons on the anhydride part (**H_anhydride** at C5 and C6). They are α to carbonyls and equivalent.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This describes one of the two diastereotopic protons of the C7 bridge (**H_bridge**). Let's call them H7_syn and H7_anti. They couple to each other, so they appear as two doublets. This resonance represents one of them.\n\n    *   Now, let's analyze the spatial proximities for the NOE interaction unique to the major (*endo*) product.\n\n    *   **In the *endo* (major) isomer:**\n        *   The H_anhydride protons are on the same side as the C7 bridge. Specifically, they are very close to the *anti* proton of the bridge (H7_anti).\n        *   The H_anhydride protons are under the C=C double bond, and thus are relatively far from the Me_vinyl groups.\n\n    *   **In the *exo* (minor) isomer:**\n        *   The H_anhydride protons are on the opposite side of the C7 bridge and are far from its protons.\n        *   The H_anhydride protons are on the same side as the C=C double bond and are close to the Me_vinyl groups.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge):** The bridgehead methyls are close to the C7 bridge in *both* isomers. This NOE is not unique to the major product.\n    *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride):** In the major (*endo*) isomer, the H_anhydride protons are close to the H_bridge protons. In the minor (*exo*) isomer, they are far apart. This matches the condition perfectly.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl):** These adjacent methyl groups are close in *both* isomers. This NOE is not unique to the major product.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride):** These groups are close in the minor (*exo*) isomer, but far apart in the major (*endo*) isomer. This is the opposite of what the question asks for.\n\nConclusion: The only interaction that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product is the one between the bridge protons and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<B>>>"
