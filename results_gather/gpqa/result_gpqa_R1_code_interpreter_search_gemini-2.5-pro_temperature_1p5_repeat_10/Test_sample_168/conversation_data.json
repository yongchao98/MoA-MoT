    "This question explores the kinematics of a nuclear decay and how the energy spectrum of emitted particles changes when the decay products are altered. Let's analyze the two processes step by step.\n\n### **Process 1: The Original Decay**\n\nThe original decay is given by:\n`2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`\n\n*   **Participants:** Two initial heavy nucleons (2A) decay into two final heavy nucleons (2B), two light particles (2E), and two other light particles (2V). In the context of nuclear physics, this is analogous to two-neutrino double beta decay, where A is a neutron, B is a proton, E is an electron, and V is an anti-neutrino.\n*   **Energy Release (Q-value):** The total energy released is the difference between the initial total rest mass and the final total rest mass. Let `m_X` be the mass of particle X. The total kinetic energy available to the final particles is:\n    `Q_1 = (2 * m_A * c^2) - (2 * m_B * c^2 + 2 * m_E * c^2 + 2 * m_V * c^2)`\n*   **Energy Spectrum:** The problem states the energy spectrum of the `E` particles is **continuous**. This is a hallmark of a multi-body decay where more than two particles are in the final state. The released energy `Q_1` is shared among the kinetic energies of the four final particles (2B are heavy and have low recoil energy, so the energy is primarily shared between 2E and 2V). Since the two `V` particles can carry away a variable amount of energy (from zero up to `Q_1`), the energy remaining for the two `E` particles is not fixed, resulting in a continuous spectrum.\n*   **Endpoint:** The endpoint of the total energy spectrum for the two `E` particles (`E_total_E = KE_2E + 2*m_E*c^2`) corresponds to the maximum possible kinetic energy they can have (`KE_2E_max`). This maximum occurs when the other decay products (2B and 2V) take away the minimum possible energy. Neglecting the small recoil of the heavy 2B nucleus, this happens when the two `V` particles carry away zero kinetic energy. In this scenario, the two `E` particles carry away all the available kinetic energy, `Q_1`. The problem defines this endpoint as `Q`.\n\n### **Process 2: The Variant Decay**\n\nThe variant decay is given by:\n`2A -> 2B + 2E + 1M`\n\nHere, the two `V` particles are replaced by a single exotic, massless particle `M`. This is analogous to a hypothetical decay called Majoron-emitting neutrinoless double beta decay.\n\n*   **Energy Release (Q-value):** The total kinetic energy available is now:\n    `Q_2 = (2 * m_A * c^2) - (2 * m_B * c^2 + 2 * m_E * c^2 + m_M * c^2)`\n*   **Energy Spectrum:** In this case, the final state consists of `2B`, `2E`, and `M`. This is still a multi-body final state (3 components if we treat 2B and 2E as single entities). The available energy `Q_2` is shared between `2B`, `2E`, and `M`. Since the massless particle `M` can carry away a variable amount of energy, the energy left for the `2E` particles is also variable. Therefore, the total energy spectrum of the `E` particles **remains continuous**. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n### **Comparing the Endpoints**\n\nNow we compare the endpoints of the two spectra. The endpoint represents the maximum available kinetic energy for the `2E` pair.\n\n1.  **Endpoint of Process 1:** `Endpoint_1 = Q_1 = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 2m_V) * c^2`\n2.  **Endpoint of Process 2:** `Endpoint_2 = Q_2 = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - m_M) * c^2`\n\nThe problem gives us crucial information:\n*   `M` is massless, so `m_M = 0`.\n*   `V` are particles from a standard nuclear decay (implying they are neutrinos). It is an established fact in physics that neutrinos (`V`) have a small but non-zero rest mass, so `m_V > 0`.\n\nLet's substitute these into the endpoint equations:\n\n*   `Endpoint_1 = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 2m_V) * c^2`\n*   `Endpoint_2 = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 0) * c^2`\n\nComparing the two, we can see that:\n`Endpoint_2 = Endpoint_1 + 2 * m_V * c^2`\n\nSince `m_V > 0`, the term `2 * m_V * c^2` is positive. This means `Endpoint_2 > Endpoint_1`. The endpoint of the spectrum for the variant decay is higher than that of the original decay.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n1.  **Spectrum Nature:** The decay `2A -> 2B + 2E + M` is a multi-body decay, so the energy spectrum of the `E` particles remains continuous.\n2.  **Spectrum Shape:** Replacing two final-state particles (2V) with one (M) changes the phase space of the decay, which alters the statistical distribution of energy among the products. Thus, the shape of the continuous spectrum will be adjusted.\n3.  **Endpoint:** By replacing two massive neutrinos (`2V`) with one massless particle (`M`), the total rest mass of the final products is reduced. This increases the total energy (`Q-value`) available to be converted into kinetic energy. Consequently, the maximum possible energy for the `2E` particles, which defines the endpoint of their spectrum, increases.\n\nTherefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\n<<<B>>>"
