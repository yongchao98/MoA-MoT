    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex solution.\n\n**1. Understand the equilibrium**\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium reaction:\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this formation reaction ($K_f$, also given as KCa-EDTA) is very large, indicating that the reaction strongly favors the formation of the complex.\n$K_f = K_{Ca-EDTA} = \\frac{[[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nWe are interested in the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ ions, which are produced when the complex dissociates. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n$[Ca-EDTA]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Calculate the dissociation constant ($K_d$)**\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction, $K_d$, is the reciprocal of the formation constant, $K_f$:\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nThe expression for $K_d$ is:\n$K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}]}$\n\n**3. Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table**\n\nWe start with a 0.02 M solution of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium.\n\n| Species           | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ----------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n*Note: The problem assumes an \"ideal pH,\" which simplifies the problem by allowing us to use the given formation constant directly without considering the protonation of the EDTA ligand. We assume the EDTA species is the fully deprotonated $EDTA^{4-}$*\n\n**4. Solve for the concentration of Calcium ions (x)**\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the dissociation constant expression:\n$K_d = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nBecause $K_d$ is extremely small, the amount of dissociation (x) will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption that:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe equation becomes:\n$\\frac{x^2}{0.02} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$:\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x \\approx 6.3245 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\nSo, the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
