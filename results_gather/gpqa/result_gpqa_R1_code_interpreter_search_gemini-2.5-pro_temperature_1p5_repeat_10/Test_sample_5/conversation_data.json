    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    The Schrödinger equation is often easier to solve if the potential can be separated into functions of independent coordinates. Let's convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the standard transformations:\n    *   `x = r cos(θ)`\n    *   `y = r sin(θ)`\n    *   `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`\n\n    Substituting these into the potential expression:\n    *   The term `r^2` becomes `x^2 + y^2`.\n    *   The term `r^2 cos^2(θ)` is equivalent to `(r cos(θ))^2`, which is `x^2`.\n\n    Now, rewrite the potential V in terms of x and y:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(x^2)\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2\n    Combine the terms with x^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n3.  **Separate the Hamiltonian:**\n    The potential is now in a separable form, `V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)`, where:\n    *   `V_x(x) = 2kx^2`\n    *   `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`\n\n    This means the 2D Schrödinger equation can be separated into two independent 1D Schrödinger equations, one for the x-direction and one for the y-direction. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies from each dimension: `E = E_x + E_y`.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Energy in the x-direction (E_x):**\n    The potential for the x-motion is `V_x(x) = 2kx^2`. This is the potential of a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). The standard form for a QHO potential is `1/2 mω^2x^2`.\n    By comparing the two forms, we can find the angular frequency `ω_x`:\n    1/2 m(ω_x)^2 = 2k\n    (ω_x)^2 = 4k/m\n    ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D QHO are given by `E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω`. For the x-direction, this becomes:\n    E_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x\n    E_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n    E_nx = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    where `n_x = 0, 1, 2, ...`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Energy in the y-direction (E_y):**\n    The potential for the y-motion is `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`.\n    Comparing this to the standard form `1/2 mω^2y^2`:\n    1/2 m(ω_y)^2 = 1/2 k\n    (ω_y)^2 = k/m\n    ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-direction are:\n    E_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y\n    E_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    where `n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Energy:**\n    The total energy `E` is the sum of `E_nx` and `E_ny`:\n    E = E_nx + E_ny\n    E = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    Factor out the common term `ħ * sqrt(k/m)`:\n    E = [(2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is `E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)`.\n    Let's check the given choices:\n    A) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    D) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\n    The result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
