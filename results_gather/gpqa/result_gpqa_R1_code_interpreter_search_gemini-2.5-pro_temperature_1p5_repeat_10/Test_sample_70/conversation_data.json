    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2, which is T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula is:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n    Where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2. Let's write out the expressions for each planet:\n    `T_eq4 = T_star * (1 - A_4)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_4))`\n    `T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))`\n\n    Now, divide the first equation by the second:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_4)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_4))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** Several terms are constant for both planets and will cancel out:\n    *   `T_star` and `R_star` are the same because they orbit the same star.\n    *   The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, so `A_4 = A_2`. This means the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term also cancels out.\n    *   The constant `2` within the square root cancels out.\n\n    After cancellation, the formula simplifies significantly:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_4) / sqrt(1 / a_2)`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)`\n    This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (`T_eq ∝ 1/√a`).\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period:** The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods (P), not the semi-major axes (a). We can connect these two using Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which states that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis:\n    `P² ∝ a³`\n    This can be rearranged to express `a` in terms of `P`:\n    `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute this relationship into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_4) = sqrt((P_2^(2/3)) / (P_4^(2/3)))`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt((P_2 / P_4)^(2/3))`\n    The square root (power of 1/2) and the power of 2/3 can be combined:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Calculate Using the Given Period Ratios:** The problem gives the orbital period ratios as `P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`.\n    From this, we can take the proportional values for `P_2` and `P_4`:\n    *   `P_2` corresponds to 2.\n    *   `P_4` corresponds to 3.5.\n\n    Now, plug these values into our final equation:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n    To make the calculation easier, convert the fraction:\n    `2 / 3.5 = 2 / (7/2) = 4/7`\n    So, `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4/7)^(1/3)`\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Value:** The final step is to calculate the cube root of 4/7. This can be done with a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio (4/7)^(1/3)\nresult = (4/7)**(1/3)\nprint(result)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.8299834283832303\n</execute_output>\nThe calculation gives a value of approximately 0.83.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The reasoning for this problem has already been established and confirmed. Here's a summary of the logic:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Relation:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its semi-major axis (`a`), assuming the star's properties and the planet's albedo are constant.\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)`\n    Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures of Planet 4 to Planet 2 is:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)`\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law connects the semi-major axis (`a`) to the orbital period (`P`):\n    `P² ∝ a³` or `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n    So, the ratio of their semi-major axes can be expressed in terms of their orbital periods:\n    `a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`\n\n3.  **Combining the Formulas:** By substituting the relationship from Kepler's Law into the temperature ratio equation, we get:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt((P_2 / P_4)^(2/3))`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\n4.  **Calculation:** The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as `P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`.\n    *   `P_2` is proportional to 2.\n    *   `P_4` is proportional to 3.5.\n    Substituting these values into the final formula:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3)`\n\nThe code execution confirmed the numerical result of this expression:\n` (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.82998 `\n\nThis value rounded to two decimal places is `0.83`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
