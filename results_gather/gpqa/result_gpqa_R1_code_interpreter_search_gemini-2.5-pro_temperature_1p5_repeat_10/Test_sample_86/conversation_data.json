    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This implies a benzene ring with two groups attached, having the general formula R1-C6H4-R2.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents (R1 and R2) must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...carbonyl group (C=O)\"**: One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly bonded to the aromatic ring. Let's call this -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   We have one halogen substituent (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain a carbonyl group and the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   Let's list the possibilities for a C2 substituent with a C=O group:\n        *   **Acetyl group**: -C(=O)CH3. This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl.\n        *   **Formylmethyl group**: -CH2CHO. This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl (from the aldehyde).\n        *   Other possibilities like carboxylic acid (-COOH) only have one carbon, and esters (-COOR) would likely have more than 2 carbons unless R is a proton (which is a carboxylic acid).\n\n3.  **Propose Candidate Molecular Structures:**\n    Based on the above, we have two main structural possibilities:\n    *   **Structure 1**: A benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3). This is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n    *   **Structure 2**: A benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and a formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO). This is a **(halophenyl)acetaldehyde**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Options and Predict Spectra for Candidate Structures:**\n    The options present chemical shifts (δ in ppm), integration (number of protons, e.g., 1H), and multiplicity (singlet (s), doublet (d), etc.).\n\n    *   **Option A) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at **δ 9.9 (1H, s)** is highly characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**. This strongly suggests Structure 2.\n        *   The two doublets at **δ 7.8 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.6 (2H, d)** are a classic signature of a **para (1,4) substituted benzene ring**.\n        *   The peak at **δ 3.7 (2H, s)** is consistent with a **methylene group (-CH2-)** that is benzylic (attached to the ring) and also alpha to a carbonyl group, which both cause a downfield shift.\n        *   **Let's see if this matches Structure 2:** The proposed structure would be **2-(4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n            *   Aldehyde proton (-CHO): Yes, at ~9.9 ppm.\n            *   Methylene protons (-CH2-): Yes, at ~3.7 ppm.\n            *   Para-substituted aromatic protons: Yes, at ~7.8 and ~7.6 ppm.\n            *   *Note on multiplicity*: Technically, the CH2 and CHO protons should couple, resulting in a doublet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CHO. However, this coupling (J-value) is often small (~2-3 Hz) and may not be resolved, causing the peaks to appear as singlets. This is a common simplification in spectroscopy problems. All the chemical shifts and integrations match this structure perfectly.\n\n    *   **Option C) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks the downfield aldehyde peak seen in A.\n        *   The two doublets at **δ 7.8 and 7.6** again suggest a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n        *   The peak at **δ 2.3 (3H, s)** corresponds to a **methyl group (-CH3)**.\n        *   **Let's see if this matches Structure 1:** The proposed structure would be **4-haloacetophenone**.\n            *   This structure has aromatic protons (4H) and methyl protons (3H), totaling 7 protons, which matches the integration in option C (2H + 2H + 3H = 7H).\n            *   However, the chemical shift for an acetyl methyl group (-COCH3) is typically around **δ 2.5-2.6 ppm**. The value of **δ 2.3 ppm** is unusually low and is more characteristic of a methyl group directly attached to the benzene ring (a tolyl group), which does not contain a carbonyl. This significant discrepancy in chemical shift makes this option less likely.\n\n    *   **Options B) and D)**: These can be quickly eliminated. The chemical shifts (e.g., 4.8, 4.6, 1.3 ppm) are not in the typical range for aromatic protons (which are usually > 6.5 ppm). They do not describe a di-substituted benzene ring.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Option A provides a set of data that is an excellent match for 2-(4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde. The key diagnostic peaks—the aldehyde proton at 9.9 ppm and the benzylic methylene at 3.7 ppm—are at their expected chemical shifts. The aromatic pattern also fits. The only minor discrepancy is the simplified multiplicity, which is acceptable.\n    Option C corresponds to 4-haloacetophenone, but the chemical shift for the methyl group (2.3 ppm) is incorrect for an acetyl group (expected ~2.6 ppm).\n\nTherefore, the data in option A is the correct identification for the described compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
