    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Process\nThe problem describes a two-step electric dipole (E1) transition for a hydrogen atom, cascading from the initial state |n,l,m> = |3,0,0> (also known as the 3s state) to the final state |1,0,0> (the 1s ground state) through an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Determine the Intermediate State using Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   **Δl = ±1**\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**\n\n**First transition: |3,0,0> → |n',l',m'>**\n*   The initial state has l=0. To satisfy Δl=±1, the intermediate state must have **l'=1**.\n*   The initial state has m=0. To satisfy Δm=0, ±1, the intermediate state can have **m' = 0, +1, or -1**.\n*   The problem implies a cascade decay, so the principal quantum number n must decrease. The only allowed n between 3 and 1 is **n'=2**.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are the sublevels of the 2p orbital: **|2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>**.\n\n**Second transition: |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\n*   The initial state for this step has l'=1. The final state has l''=0. The change is **Δl = 0 - 1 = -1**, which satisfies the selection rule.\n*   For the change in magnetic quantum number, Δm = m'' - m' = 0 - m'. This must be 0, ±1.\n    *   If m' = 0, Δm = 0 (allowed).\n    *   If m' = +1, Δm = -1 (allowed).\n    *   If m' = -1, Δm = +1 (allowed).\n*   All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0>.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of Each Transition Route\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio for that cascade path compared to all other possible two-step cascade paths to the ground state. The probability of a given cascade path through an intermediate state |m'> is proportional to the product of the transition rates (or strengths) for each step:\n\nProbability(route via m') ∝ Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) × Rate(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>)\n\nThe relative rates for these transitions can be determined using the Hönl-London factors, which give the relative strengths of spectral lines originating from the same initial level or ending on the same level. We will use the formulas from a standard text like Bethe and Salpeter's \"Quantum Mechanics of One- and Two-Electron Atoms\". The transition rate is proportional to a factor 'A' given by these formulas.\n\n**Step 1: Relative rates for |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>**\nThis is a transition from l=0, m=0 to l'=l+1=1. The formulas for the strength A(l,m → l+1,m') are:\n*   A(l,m → l+1, m-1) ∝ (l-m+1)(l-m+2)\n*   A(l,m → l+1, m)   ∝ 4(l-m+1)(l+m+1)\n*   A(l,m → l+1, m+1) ∝ (l+m+1)(l+m+2)\n\nApplying this for l=0, m=0:\n*   Rate(m'=-1): A(0,0 → 1,-1) ∝ (0-0+1)(0-0+2) = 2\n*   Rate(m'=0):   A(0,0 → 1,0)   ∝ 4(0-0+1)(0+0+1) = 4\n*   Rate(m'=+1): A(0,0 → 1,+1) ∝ (0+0+1)(0+0+2) = 2\n\nThe relative rates for populating the intermediate states m'=-1, 0, +1 are in the ratio **2 : 4 : 2**, or **1 : 2 : 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Relative rates for |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\nThis is a transition from an initial state with l=1 to a final state with l''=l-1=0 and m''=0. We need the rates from each m' sublevel to the final state. The formulas for A(l,m → l-1,m'') are:\n*   A(l,m → l-1, m-1) ∝ (l+m)(l+m-1)\n*   A(l,m → l-1, m)   ∝ 4(l+m)(l-m)\n*   A(l,m → l-1, m+1) ∝ (l-m)(l-m-1)\n\nApplying this for l=1, with various initial m values, all ending in m''=0:\n*   **From m'=-1:** We need the transition m→m+1 to get to m''=0. A(1,-1 → 0,0) ∝ (l-m)(l-m-1) = (1-(-1))(1-(-1)-1) = (2)(1) = 2.\n*   **From m'=0:** We need the transition m→m. A(1,0 → 0,0) ∝ 4(l+m)(l-m) = 4(1+0)(1-0) = 4.\n*   **From m'=+1:** We need the transition m→m-1. A(1,1 → 0,0) ∝ (l+m)(l+m-1) = (1+1)(1+1-1) = (2)(1) = 2.\n\nThe relative rates for the second decay step, from the states m'=-1, 0, +1, are also in the ratio **2 : 4 : 2**, or **1 : 2 : 1**.\n\n### 4. Combine Probabilities and Normalize\nNow we find the unnormalized probability for each full cascade route by multiplying the relative strengths from each step.\n\n*   **Route via |2,1,-1>:** Prob ∝ (Rate 1) × (Rate 2) = 1 × 1 = 1\n*   **Route via |2,1,0>:**  Prob ∝ (Rate 1) × (Rate 2) = 2 × 2 = 4\n*   **Route via |2,1,1>:**   Prob ∝ (Rate 1) × (Rate 2) = 1 × 1 = 1\n\nThe total relative probability for all three routes is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\nNow we normalize to find the final probabilities:\n*   P(Route via m'=-1) = 1/6\n*   P(Route via m'=0)  = 4/6 = **2/3**\n*   P(Route via m'=+1) = 1/6\n\n### 5. Final Answer\nWe compare these results with the given options:\n*   A) Route through |2,1,-1> with probability 1/4. (Our result is 1/6)\n*   B) Route through |2,1,0> with probability 2/3. (Our result is 2/3)\n*   C) Route through |2,1,0> with probability 1/3. (Our result is 2/3)\n*   D) Route through |2,1,1> with probability 1/4. (Our result is 1/6)\n\nThe calculation matches option B.\n\nThe transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ has a corresponding probability of $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
