    "This problem involves determining the energy levels of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Since spin-1/2 particles are fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n### **1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by the formula:\n`E_n = n^2 * (ħ^2 * π^2) / (2mL^2)`\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   `m` is the mass of the particle.\n*   `L` is the length of the well.\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit `E = (ħ^2 * π^2) / (2mL^2)`.\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n`E_n = n^2 * E`\n\n*   `E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`\n*   `E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n*   `E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n*   `E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n*   and so on.\n\n### **2. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 fermions. A particle's state is defined by its principal quantum number `n` and its spin quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down). The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. This means that for each energy level `n`, we can have at most two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### **3. Ground State Energy (E_g)**\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we must place the four particles into the lowest possible energy levels without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy = 1E):** We can place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_g = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2)`\n`E_g = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n### **4. First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state corresponds to the lowest possible energy greater than the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   Ground state configuration: Two particles in n=1, two in n=2.\n*   Highest Occupied Level: n=2.\n*   Lowest Unoccupied Level: n=3.\n\nWe move one particle from n=2 to n=3. The new configuration is:\n*   Two particles in **n=1** (Energy = 2 * 1E = 2E)\n*   One particle in **n=2** (Energy = 1 * 4E = 4E)\n*   One particle in **n=3** (Energy = 1 * 9E = 9E)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n`E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n### **5. Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy. We must consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy (after the first excited state).\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (achieved by exciting a particle from n=2 to n=3)\n\nLet's examine other possible excitations from the ground state:\n\n*   **Option 1: Excite a particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\n*   **Option 2: Excite two particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n\n*   **Option 3: Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
