    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars, let's call it `N`, varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`.\n    This can be written as a proportionality:\n    N ∝ 1/plx^5\n\n2.  **Establish the Relationship between Parallax and Distance:**\n    Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are fundamentally related in astronomy. Parallax is the apparent shift of an object against a distant background when viewed from two different lines of sight. For stars, this is measured using Earth's orbit. The relationship is inversely proportional:\n    plx ∝ 1/r\n    or, for simplicity, we can set the proportionality constant to 1 and write:\n    plx = 1/r\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars in Terms of Distance:**\n    The statement \"the number of stars varies with parallax\" is typically interpreted as the cumulative number of stars with a parallax greater than a given value `plx`. This is equivalent to the cumulative number of stars *within* a certain distance `r`. Let's call this cumulative number `N_cum`.\n\n    We start with the given relation:\n    N_cum ∝ 1/plx^5\n\n    Now, substitute the relationship `plx = 1/r` into this expression:\n    N_cum ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5\n    N_cum ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)\n    N_cum ∝ r^5\n\n    This tells us that the total number of stars observed out to a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of that distance.\n\n4.  **Understand the Question:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This is not asking for the cumulative number `N_cum`, but rather for the density of stars with respect to distance. In mathematical terms, this is the rate of change of the cumulative number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative `dN_cum/dr`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative:**\n    We have the proportionality for the cumulative number of stars:\n    N_cum(r) = k * r^5  (where `k` is a constant of proportionality)\n\n    To find the number of stars per unit range of distance, we differentiate `N_cum(r)` with respect to `r`:\n    dN_cum/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)\n\n    Using the power rule for differentiation (d/dx(x^n) = n*x^(n-1)):\n    dN_cum/dr = k * 5 * r^(5-1)\n    dN_cum/dr = 5k * r^4\n\n6.  **State the Final Proportionality:**\n    From the derivative, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`:\n    dN_cum/dr ∝ r^4\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) ~ r^3\n    *   B) ~ r^4\n    *   C) ~ r^2\n    *   D) ~ r^5\n\n    Our result, `~ r^4`, matches option B.\n\nTo verify this, we can perform a simple numerical check.\n```python\n# Let the cumulative number of stars be N(r) = r**5.\n# We want to find how the number of stars per unit distance, dN/dr, scales with r.\n# The analytical derivative is dN/dr = 5 * r**4.\n# So we expect a scaling of r**4.\n# Let's test this by comparing the numerical derivative at two different distances, r1 and r2.\n\n# Set two distances\nr1 = 10\nr2 = 20 # r2 is twice r1\n\n# We use a small step dr for numerical differentiation\ndr = 0.0001\n\n# Calculate the numerical derivative (number of stars per unit distance) at r1\n# dN/dr is approximated by (N(r+dr) - N(r)) / dr\ndN_dr_at_r1 = ((r1 + dr)**5 - r1**5) / dr\n\n# Calculate the numerical derivative at r2\ndN_dr_at_r2 = ((r2 + dr)**5 - r2**5) / dr\n\n# Now find the ratio of these two values\nratio_of_derivatives = dN_dr_at_r2 / dN_dr_at_r1\n\n# Now calculate the expected ratio if the scaling is r^4.\n# The ratio should be (r2/r1)^4\nexpected_ratio_for_r4_scaling = (r2 / r1)**4\n\nprint(f\"The ratio of (dN/dr at r={r2}) to (dN/dr at r={r1}) is: {ratio_of_derivatives:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The expected ratio for a scaling of r^4 is: {expected_ratio_for_r4_scaling:.4f}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance range and the distance itself. Let's break down the given information and relationships.\n\n1.  **Given Relationship:**\n    The number of stars, let's denote it by `N`, is observed to vary with parallax (`plx`) according to the relation:\n    N ∝ 1 / plx⁵\n\n    This relationship typically refers to the *cumulative* number of stars with a parallax greater than a certain value `plx`. A larger parallax corresponds to a closer star, so this is equivalent to the total number of stars observed within a certain distance. Let's call this cumulative number `N_cum`.\n\n2.  **Parallax and Distance:**\n    Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to the star. The relationship is:\n    plx ∝ 1/r\n    For simplicity in our proportionality calculations, we can write `plx = c/r`, where `c` is a constant. We can even set `c=1` without loss of generality for determining the final proportionality.\n    plx = 1/r\n\n3.  **Express Cumulative Number of Stars in terms of Distance:**\n    We can substitute the parallax-distance relationship into the given number-count relation.\n    N_cum ∝ 1 / plx⁵\n    N_cum ∝ 1 / (1/r)⁵\n    N_cum ∝ 1 / (1/r⁵)\n    N_cum ∝ r⁵\n\n    This tells us that the total number of stars counted out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n    We can write this as `N_cum(r) = k * r⁵` for some constant `k`.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    The question asks for \"how the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is the number density of stars in a spherical shell at distance `r`. Mathematically, this corresponds to the rate of change of the cumulative number with respect to distance, which is the derivative `dN_cum/dr`.\n\n    Let's differentiate `N_cum(r)` with respect to `r`:\n    `dN_cum/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)`\n\n    Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx (x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`):\n    `dN_cum/dr = k * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN_cum/dr = 5k * r⁴`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN_cum/dr`) is proportional to `r⁴`.\n\n    `dN_cum/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n    Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) ~ r³\n    B) ~ r⁴\n    C) ~ r²\n    D) ~ r⁵\n\n    The correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
