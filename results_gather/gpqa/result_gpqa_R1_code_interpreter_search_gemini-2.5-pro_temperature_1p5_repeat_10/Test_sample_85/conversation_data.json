    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **\"pyran-2-one\"**: This indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (pyran) and a carbonyl group at the C2 position, making it a delta-lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **\"tetrahydro-\"**: The ring is saturated.\n*   **\"4-ethyl\"**: An ethyl group is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   The C4 carbon, bearing the ethyl group, is a chiral center. The products are the specific enantiomers, (R) in the first reaction and (S) in the second.\n\nLet's draw the general structure of the product:\n```\n      O        // The O is position 1, the C=O is C2\n     / \\\n  C(=O) CH2\n  /     \\\n CH2      CH-CH2CH3   // This is C4, the chiral center\n  \\     /\n   CH2\n```\nThe chirality at C4 determines if it's the (R) or (S) enantiomer.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe starting materials (A and B) are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's decode this name to understand its structure.\n*   **\"pentanoic acid\"**: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   **\"3-ethyl\"**: An ethyl group at C3. This C3 is a chiral center.\n*   **\"5-oxo\" and \"5-isobutoxy\"**: This describes the group at C5. Together, they form an isobutyl ester, -C(=O)O-iBu.\nSo, the molecule has a carboxylic acid at one end and an isobutyl ester at the other end. It is a mono-ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\n\nStructure of the starting material:\n```\n     HOOC - CH2 - CH - CH2 - C(=O)O-iBu\n                 |\n               CH2CH3\n IUPAC numbering: C1   C2   C3    C4     C5\n```\nThe chiral center in the starting material is at C3. This chiral center corresponds to the C4 chiral center in the lactone product. Since the reactions involved (reduction and cyclization) do not affect this stereocenter, the configuration (R or S) of the starting material will be the same as the configuration of the final product.\n\nThe two different reducing agents have different selectivities:\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a moderately strong reducing agent. Crucially, it selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acids react with the hydride to form a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to further reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It typically does not reduce esters under the same conditions.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction**: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent**: LiBH₄. It will reduce the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) untouched.\n*   **Step 1 (Reduction)**:\n    ```\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  --[LiBH₄]-->  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    ```\n    The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Step 2 (Lactonization)**: The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylic acid and catalyzes intramolecular esterification. The hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon to form the stable six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The original chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, its configuration is preserved. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product.\n*   **Conclusion**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction**: B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent**: BH₃. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the ester group (-COOiBu) untouched.\n*   **Step 1 (Reduction)**:\n    ```\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  --[BH₃]-->  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n    ```\n    The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   **Step 2 (Lactonization)**: The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the ester carbonyl carbon to form the lactone ring, displacing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: As in reaction 1, the chiral center at C3 is unaffected. Its configuration is preserved. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product.\n*   **Conclusion**: To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is the **(R)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material **B** is the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
