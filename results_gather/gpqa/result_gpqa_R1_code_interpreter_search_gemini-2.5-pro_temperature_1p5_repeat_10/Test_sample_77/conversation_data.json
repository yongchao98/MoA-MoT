    "This problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials, V and $\\vec{A}$, generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, c. Therefore, the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time t depend on the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, known as the retarded time, $t_r$.\n\n**1. Definitions and Setup:**\n*   q: the point charge.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t)$: the trajectory of the charge as a function of time.\n*   $\\vec{v}(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt$: the velocity of the charge.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: the observation point (field point).\n*   $t$: the time of observation.\n*   $t_r$: the retarded time, which is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach point $\\vec{r}$ at time t. The condition defining $t_r$ is:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{v} \\equiv \\vec{v}(t_r)$: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$: the distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n\nFrom the definition of retarded time, we have the crucial relation: $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n**2. Deriving the Potentials (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):**\nThe scalar and vector potentials for a general time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\nFor a point charge q moving along $\\vec{s}(t')$, the densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe evaluation of this integral is a standard procedure in electromagnetism. The presence of $t_r$ within the argument of the delta function complicates a direct evaluation. The result of this integration (which involves a change of variables and properties of the Dirac delta function) is:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nThe subscript $t_r$ means all quantities inside the bracket ($\\vec{d}, d, \\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\nLet's rewrite the denominator to match the form in the options:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\nSo,\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q c}{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q \\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\nSubstituting the denominator expression:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q c \\vec{v}}{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\n**3. Comparing with the Options:**\nThe derived expressions are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese match option A perfectly.\n\n*   Option B has a `+` sign in the denominator, which is incorrect.\n*   Option C uses the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for retardation and the velocity correction in the denominator.\n*   Option D uses the static potential and has an incorrect form for the vector potential.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
