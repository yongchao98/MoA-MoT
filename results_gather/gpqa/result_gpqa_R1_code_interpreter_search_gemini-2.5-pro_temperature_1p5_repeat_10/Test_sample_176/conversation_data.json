    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where:\n    *   $L$ is the luminosity.\n    *   $R$ is the stellar radius.\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the star's effective surface temperature.\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:** To find the ratio of luminosities for the two stars, we can write:\n    $L_1 = 4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n    $L_2 = 4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\n    Dividing the first equation by the second, the constants ($4\\pi\\sigma$) cancel out:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n4.  **Determine the Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 ($R_1 = 1.5 R_2$).\n    Therefore, the ratio of the radii is $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n    Squaring this ratio gives us the first part of our equation:\n    $\\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part of the problem.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{max,obs}$) of the two stars are the same. This is the wavelength at which they *appear* brightest.\n    *   The emitted peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max,emit}$) is related to the star's temperature by Wien's Displacement Law: $\\lambda_{max,emit} = b/T$, where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n    *   The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity due to the Doppler effect. The formula for the relativistic Doppler shift relates observed wavelength to emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$. For non-relativistic speeds ($v \\ll c$), this simplifies to $\\lambda_{obs} \\approx \\lambda_{emit}(1 + v/c)$, where $v$ is the radial velocity (positive for motion away from the observer, causing a redshift).\n\n    *   For Star_1: Radial velocity $v_1 = 0$. Therefore, there is no Doppler shift.\n        $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,emit,1}$\n\n    *   For Star_2: Radial velocity $v_2 = 700$ km/s. This is a significant speed, and the star is moving away from us.\n        $\\lambda_{max,obs,2} = \\lambda_{max,emit,2} (1 + v_2/c)$\n\n    *   Since the observed peak wavelengths are equal ($\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$):\n        $\\lambda_{max,emit,1} = \\lambda_{max,emit,2} (1 + v_2/c)$\n\n    *   Now, we substitute Wien's Law ($\\lambda_{max,emit} = b/T$) into this equation:\n        $\\frac{b}{T_1} = \\frac{b}{T_2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_2}{c}\\right)$\n\n    *   Cancel the constant $b$ and rearrange to find the temperature ratio $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$:\n        $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \\frac{v_2}{c} \\implies \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Now, substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (2.25) \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4}$\n\n7.  **Plug in the Numerical Values:**\n    *   $v_2 = 700$ km/s\n    *   $c$ (speed of light) $\\approx 3 \\times 10^5$ km/s\n    *   $\\frac{v_2}{c} = \\frac{700}{300000} = \\frac{7}{3000}$\n\n    We can now compute the final value using a Python script for accuracy. The other given information (mass ratio) is extraneous and not needed for this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nR_ratio = 1.5\nv2_kms = 700  # km/s\nc_kms = 3e5   # km/s\n\n# Calculate the square of the radius ratio\nR_ratio_sq = R_ratio**2\n\n# Calculate the ratio v/c for Star_2\nv2_c_ratio = v2_kms / c_kms\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio (T1/T2)\nT_ratio = 1 / (1 + v2_c_ratio)\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio (L1/L2)\nL_ratio = R_ratio_sq * (T_ratio**4)\n\nprint(f\"{L_ratio:.4f}\")\n```\n2.2291\n\nThe calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.2291, which rounds to 2.23. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of ~2.23.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Luminosity and the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** To find how many times greater the luminosity of Star_1 is compared to Star_2, we take their ratio:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$. Therefore:\n    $\\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio (from Wien's Law and Doppler Shift):**\n    *   Wien's Displacement Law relates a star's temperature to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation: $T = b / \\lambda_{emitted}$, where b is Wien's constant. This means $T \\propto 1 / \\lambda_{emitted}$.\n    *   The *observed* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is affected by the star's radial velocity (v) due to the Doppler effect: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted} (1 + v/c)$, where c is the speed of light.\n    *   We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n\n5.  **Applying the conditions to each star:**\n    *   For Star_1: $v_1 = 0$. Its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2: $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its observed wavelength is redshifted: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have:\n        $\\lambda_{emitted,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_2/c)$\n\n6.  **Finding the Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   From Wien's Law, $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted,2}/\\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n    *   Rearranging the equation from the previous step: $\\frac{\\lambda_{emitted,2}}{\\lambda_{emitted,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (2.25) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4$\n    Using the values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c = 3 \\times 10^5$ km/s:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + 700 / 300000}\\right)^4$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times (0.99767)^4 \\approx 2.2291$\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the mass ratio is extra information not needed for the calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
