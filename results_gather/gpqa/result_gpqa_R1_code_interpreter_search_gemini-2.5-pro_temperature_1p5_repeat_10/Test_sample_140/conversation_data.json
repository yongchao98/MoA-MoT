    "This problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This is a classic example of a reaction proceeding via a benzyne intermediate through an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\nLet's break down the reaction mechanism step-by-step to identify all possible products.\n\n**Reactant:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d\nThe structure has a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D) at position C2. The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen atoms.\n\n```\n      Br\n     /\n    (1)C--C(2)-D\n   //    \\\\\n(6)C-H    C(3)-H\n  |       |\n(5)C-H--C(4)-H\n```\n\n**Reagent:** NaNH2 in liquid NH3. The active species is the strong base, amide anion (NH2⁻).\n\n**Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide anion abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide anion (NH2⁻) removes the proton from C6. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C6.\n    3.  This carbanion attacks C1, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated.\n    4.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this process and remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n    ```\n      (Pathway A)\n      ...H at C6 abstracted... --> [3-deuteriobenzyne]\n    ```\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide anion (NH2⁻) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This pathway is slower due to the stronger C-D bond but is still possible.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C2.\n    3.  This carbanion attacks C1, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated.\n    4.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring.\n    5.  The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    ```\n      (Pathway B)\n      ...D at C2 abstracted... --> [benzyne]\n    ```\nSo, we have two possible benzyne intermediates: **3-deuteriobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide anion (NH2⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    The 3-deuteriobenzyne intermediate is asymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The NH2⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the NH2 group at C1 and the D at C2. These groups are ortho to each other. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the NH2 group at C6 and the D at C2. These groups are meta to each other. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    The standard benzyne intermediate is symmetrical. Attack by NH2⁻ at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same product.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The NH2 group attaches to one carbon, and a proton from NH3 attaches to the other. Since there is no deuterium on this intermediate, the final product is simply **aniline** (C6H5NH2).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find that three different organic products can be formed:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
