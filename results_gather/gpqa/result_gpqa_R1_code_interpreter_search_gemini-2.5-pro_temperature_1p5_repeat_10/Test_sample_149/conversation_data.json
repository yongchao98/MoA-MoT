    "**1. Analysis of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2`.\n    *   DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) - (0/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (DoU=4) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C) or ring.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** The chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it's coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-) according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3 peaks). This confirms a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for an amino group (-NH2). The broadening is due to nitrogen's quadrupole moment and chemical exchange.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). It is a doublet (d), indicating it is coupled to a single adjacent proton (1+1=2 peaks). This confirms the coupling to the aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2-CHO).\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula: C6H4 (from the ring) + C2H3O (from -CH2CHO) + NH2 = **C8H9NO**. This matches the given formula.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl**\n    *   This is a standard **diazotization reaction**. A primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻) in the presence of nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO₂ and HCl) at low temperatures (typically 0-5 °C).\n    *   Product after Step 1: **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n        *   Structure: [p-Cl⁻ ⁺N₂-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO]\n\n*   **Step 2: H₂O**\n    *   Heating an aqueous solution of a diazonium salt results in the replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a common method for synthesizing phenols.\n    *   Product after Step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n        *   Structure: [p-HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO]\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat, reacting with an aldehyde that has α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH₂- group are alpha to the aldehyde). These conditions are perfect for a self-**aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻ from KOH) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n            *   HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO + OH⁻ ⇌ [HO-C₆H₄-CH-CHO]⁻ + H₂O\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to give the aldol addition product.\n            *   Addition Product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n                ```\n                   OH\n                   |\n                HO-Ph-CH₂-CH - CH(CHO)-Ph-OH \n                ```\n        4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The α-hydrogen (at C2) and the β-hydroxyl group (at C3) are eliminated to form a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The stability is enhanced by the extensive conjugation of the new C=C double bond with both the aldehyde's C=O group and one of the phenyl rings.\n            *   Final Condensation Product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** (This corresponds to option A).\n                ```\n                   CHO\n                   |\n                HO-Ph-CH₂-CH=C-Ph-OH \n                ```\n*   **Conclusion**\n    The question asks for the **final product**. The condition \"Heat\" strongly favors the irreversible dehydration step, leading to the thermodynamically more stable condensation product over the simple addition product. Therefore, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal is the final product.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This is the aldol condensation product.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure.\n*   C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect; lacks the hydroxyl groups.\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating.\n\nThe final product is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
