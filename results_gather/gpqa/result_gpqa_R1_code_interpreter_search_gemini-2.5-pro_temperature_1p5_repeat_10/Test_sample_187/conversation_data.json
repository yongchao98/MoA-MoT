    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n    *   Lattice Parameter (interatomic distance): `a = 10` Angstrom\n    *   Interaxial Angles: `α = β = γ = 30°`\n    *   Miller Indices of the plane: `(hkl) = (111)`\n\n2.  **Find the Relevant Formula:**\n    The problem asks for the interplanar distance `d` for a specific plane `(hkl)`. For a rhombohedral crystal system, where the primitive lattice vectors have equal length `a` and the angles between them are equal (`α = β = γ`), the formula for the interplanar distance `d_hkl` is:\n    ```\n    1/d² = [(h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + hl)(cos²α - cosα)] / [a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)]\n    ```\n\n3.  **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**\n    *   `a = 10`\n    *   `α = 30°`\n    *   `h = 1`, `k = 1`, `l = 1`\n\n    Let's calculate the components of the formula:\n    *   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n    *   `hk + kl + hl = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n    *   `α = 30°`\n        *   `sin(30°) = 0.5`\n        *   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2 ≈ 0.8660`\n        *   `sin²(30°) = (0.5)² = 0.25`\n        *   `cos²(30°) = (√3 / 2)² = 3 / 4 = 0.75`\n        *   `cos³(30°) = (√3 / 2)³ = 3√3 / 8 ≈ 0.6495`\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    To ensure accuracy and avoid rounding errors, it is best to use a calculator or a script for the computation.

Calculate the denominator of the formula for `1/d²`.\n    e.  Compute `1/d²`.\n    f.  Calculate `d` by taking the square root of the reciprocal of `1/d²`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values from the problem\na = 10.0  # Angstrom\nalpha_degrees = 30.0\nh, k, l = 1, 1, 1\n\n# Convert angle from degrees to radians for trigonometric functions\nalpha_radians = math.radians(alpha_degrees)\n\n# Calculate trigonometric values\nsin_alpha = math.sin(alpha_radians)\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_radians)\n\n# Calculate the numerator of the 1/d^2 formula\nnumerator = ((h**2 + k**2 + l**2) * sin_alpha**2 + \n             2 * (h*k + k*l + h*l) * (cos_alpha**2 - cos_alpha))\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the 1/d^2 formula\n# The term for the volume of the unit cell in the denominator is a^2 * (1 - 3*cos^2(alpha) + 2*cos^3(alpha))\ndenominator = a**2 * (1 - 3*cos_alpha**2 + 2*cos_alpha**3)\n\n# Calculate 1/d^2\ninv_d_squared = numerator / denominator\n\n# Calculate d (the interplanar distance)\nd = math.sqrt(1 / inv_d_squared)\n\nprint(d)\n```\n<execute_code>\n9.537633211513476\n</execute_code>\n5.  **Analyze the Result and Choose the Correct Option:**\n    The calculated value for the interplanar distance `d` is approximately `9.538` Angstrom.\n\n    Now, let's compare this result with the given options:\n    A) 10.05 Angstrom\n    B) 9.08 Angstrom\n    C) 9.54 Angstrom\n    D) 8.95 Angstrom\n\n    The calculated value `9.538` is closest to option C, `9.54` Angstrom.\n\n<<<C>>>",
