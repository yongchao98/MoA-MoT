    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Starting material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O), heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a variation of the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which performs alpha-halogenation on a carboxylic acid. Acetic anhydride activates the carboxylic acid, and pyridine acts as a base to facilitate the formation of an enol or enolate intermediate. Bromine then adds to the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n    *   Structure: Br-CH2-COOH (alpha-Bromoacetic acid).\n\n### **Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Starting material:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH2COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by the ethoxy group from ethanol.\n    *   Structure: Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n### **Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Starting material:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   Structure: NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate). This is a well-known active methylene compound.\n\n### **Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Starting material:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n*   **Reagents:** 1) Excess sodium hydride (NaH), 2) 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-step process involving alkylation and cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of the acidic alpha-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate. The resulting carbanion is stabilized by resonance with both the nitrile (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Intermolecular Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation & Intramolecular Cyclization:** Because excess NaH is used, the remaining acidic alpha-proton on the newly formed molecule is also removed, creating a new carbanion.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n        This carbanion then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion. This cyclization is highly favorable as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethyl carboxylate group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   Structure: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CN\n          |\n     C1 --C-- COOCH2CH3\n      / \\\n     C2---C6\n     |   |\n     C3---C5\n      \\ /\n       C4\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This results in a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5. The molecule is achiral.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent. **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH2-:** The two protons of the methylene group are enantiotopic because the molecule is achiral. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent. **1 signal**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   **C2 and C6 positions:** These positions are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, on each carbon, the axial (ax) and equatorial (eq) hydrogens are diastereotopic (they have a different spatial relationship to the substituents on C1). Thus, H-2ax is equivalent to H-6ax, and H-2eq is equivalent to H-6eq, but the axial set is different from the equatorial set. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n        *   **C3 and C5 positions:** Similar to C2/C6, these positions are equivalent. The axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. This gives another **2 signals** for these four protons.\n        *   **C4 position:** The two hydrogens on C4 are diastereotopic. Although the C4 atom lies on the plane of symmetry, the two hydrogens are on opposite sides. In a fixed chair, one is axial and one is equatorial. Due to chair flipping, their environments are averaged. However, the averaged environment of one is not identical to the averaged environment of the other, because the two substituents on C1 are different (-CN vs -COOEt). For instance, in one conformer, H-4ax experiences a 1,3-diaxial interaction with the axial C1 substituent. After flipping, it becomes H-4eq, while the original H-4eq becomes H-4ax and interacts with the other C1 substituent (which is now axial). Since the two substituents are different, the averaged chemical shifts are different. Therefore, the two protons on C4 are distinct. This results in **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From Ethyl group: 1 (CH3) + 1 (CH2) = 2 signals\n    *   From Cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n    *   **Grand Total = 2 + 6 = 8 signals.**\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
