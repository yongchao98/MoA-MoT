    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental data to identify the decomposition products and their quantities.**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, which means **no CO₂ was produced**. This tells us that the original salts do not contain carbonate (CO₃²⁻) or oxalate (C₂O₄²⁻) ions.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases like oxygen (O₂) and nitrous oxide (N₂O). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms transferred to Cu = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The possible reactions are: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO and Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n    *   The 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms could come from O₂ gas, N₂O gas, or a mixture of both.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C passed through a drying agent, a base, and hot copper, indicating it's an inert gas. Given that the original salts are heated, a common inert product is nitrogen gas (N₂). Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n    *   The N₂ that exits tube №3 is the sum of any N₂ produced directly from decomposition and any N₂ produced by the reduction of N₂O in tube №3.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = n(N₂, initial) + n(N₂O, initial) = 0.10 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nThe decomposition was done without air, so all elements in the products (H, O, N) must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms:** From the 0.20 mol of H₂O, we have 2 * 0.20 = **0.40 mol of H atoms**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms:** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and was transferred to the copper in tube №3.\n    *   Moles of O from H₂O = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O from tube №3 = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol of O atoms**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms:** All nitrogen from the original salts ends up as N₂ gas (Gas C).\n    *   From the relationship n(N₂, total) = n(N₂, initial) + n(N₂O, initial) = 0.10 mol.\n    *   The total number of N atoms is 2 * n(N₂, initial) + 2 * n(N₂O, initial) = 2 * [n(N₂, initial) + n(N₂O, initial)] = 2 * 0.10 = **0.20 mol of N atoms**.\n\n**Step 3: Check for mass conservation.**\nLet's calculate the total mass of these elements to see if it matches the initial mass.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol * 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol * 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass = 0.40 + 4.00 + 2.80 = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our calculations of the elemental composition are correct.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nThe salts contain only H, N, and O. They are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions, as these are known to decompose upon heating to produce water and nitrogen-containing gases. The most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's assume:\n*   Salt A = NH₄NO₂ (Molar mass = 14+4+14+32 = 64 g/mol)\n*   Salt B = NH₄NO₃ (Molar mass = 14+4+14+48 = 80 g/mol)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of salt A, and 'n' be the number of moles of salt B.\n\nLet's find the total moles of each element in the mixture in terms of 'n':\n*   Total moles of H = (4 from A) * n + (4 from B) * n = 8n\n*   Total moles of N = (2 from A) * n + (2 from B) * n = 4n\n*   Total moles of O = (2 from A) * n + (3 from B) * n = 5n\n\nNow, we equate these expressions with the moles of elements we calculated in Step 2:\n*   For H: 8n = 0.40 mol  => n = 0.05 mol\n*   For N: 4n = 0.20 mol  => n = 0.05 mol\n*   For O: 5n = 0.25 mol  => n = 0.05 mol\n\nAll three calculations yield the same value for n (n = 0.05 mol), which strongly confirms that our identification of salts A and B is correct.\n\nLet's verify this with the total mass:\n*   Total mass = n * M_A + n * M_B = 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol + 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass perfectly.\n\n**Step 5: Answer the question.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>"
