    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The core of this part is therefore C6H4.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R'. This group contains one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms (-COO-). This accounts for the O2 in all the given options.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. The final structure cannot contain any methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they show up as only two signals strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern due to the molecule's symmetry. This doesn't change the atom count (still C6H4), but it helps in visualizing the structure.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-).\n        *   The splitting patterns give a crucial clue. A doublet of quartets (dq) means a proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and to three other equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This pattern is characteristic of a proton in a `-CH=CH-CH3` group. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the CH3 group will be split into a dq.\n        *   The other vinyl proton would be a doublet, as it's only coupled to its vinyl partner.\n        *   Therefore, the NMR data indicates the presence of a **propenyl group** (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This fragment consists of 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (C3H5). It also accounts for one of the two methyl groups mentioned.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   We have already identified one CH3 group as part of the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   The presence of a second CH3 signal means there is another methyl group (`-CH3`) elsewhere in the molecule. This fragment is C1H3.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Pieces and Calculate the Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from all the fragments we've identified based on the spectral data:\n    *   **Aromatic ring:** C6H4\n    *   **Ester group (carbonyl part):** C (the COO carbon) and O2\n    *   **Propenyl group:** C3H5 (This accounts for the vinyl protons and one CH3 group)\n    *   **Second methyl group:** C1H3\n\n    Now, let's total the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 1 (from ester) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from the other methyl) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from the other methyl) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = 2\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU formula is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. For C11H12O2:\n    DoU = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6.\n    Let's check if our proposed structure matches this DoU:\n    *   Benzene ring: 4 degrees of unsaturation (1 ring + 3 double bonds)\n    *   C=C double bond (from the propenyl group): 1 degree of unsaturation\n    *   C=O double bond (from the ester group): 1 degree of unsaturation\n    *   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    The calculated DoU matches the structural features deduced from the spectra.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Other Options:**\n    *   **C11H14O2:** DoU = 5. This is inconsistent with the presence of a benzene ring, a C=C bond, and a C=O bond.\n    *   **C12H14O2:** DoU = 6. To get this formula from C11H12O2, one must add a CH2 unit. However, the NMR data explicitly states there are no –CH2 groups.\n    *   **C12H12O2:** DoU = 7. This requires an additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., another double bond or ring) compared to our deduced structure, which is not supported by the NMR data.\n\nThe only formula that perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
