    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The core of the question is to find the angle between the two photons produced from an electron-positron annihilation. This is a classic relativistic physics problem involving conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Initial State:**\n    *   We have an electron and a positron. They are anti-particles, so they have the same rest mass, which I'll call $m_e$.\n    *   Electron: Moves left-to-right (I'll define this as the +x direction). Its Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n    *   Positron: Moves right-to-left (the -x direction). Its Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n    *   The system is initially confined to the horizontal (x-axis), so the initial momentum in the vertical (y-axis) direction is zero.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Physics Principles:** The key principles governing this collision and annihilation are:\n    *   **Conservation of Total Energy:** The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum vector before the collision must equal the total momentum vector after the collision. This applies to both x and y components.\n\n4.  **Calculate Initial Energy and Momentum:**\n    *   The energy of a relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$.\n    *   The momentum is given by $p = \\sqrt{E^2/c^2 - (mc)^2} = \\sqrt{(\\gamma m c^2)^2/c^2 - (m c^2)^2/c^2} = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\cdot m c$.\n\n    *   **Electron (e-)**:\n        *   Energy: $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$.\n        *   Momentum: $p_e = \\sqrt{\\gamma_e^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c = \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c = \\sqrt{15} \\cdot m_e c$. This is in the +x direction.\n\n    *   **Positron (e+)**:\n        *   Energy: $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$.\n        *   Momentum: $p_p = \\sqrt{\\gamma_p^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c = \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot m_e c$. This is in the -x direction, so I'll assign it a negative sign in the vector sum: $p_{p,x} = -\\sqrt{3} \\cdot m_e c$.\n\n    *   **Total Initial System:**\n        *   Total Energy ($E_{total}$): $E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n        *   Total Momentum ($P_{total, x}$): $p_e + p_{p,x} = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$.\n        *   Total Momentum ($P_{total, y}$): 0.\n\n5.  **Deconstruct the Final State:**\n    *   We have two photons ($\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$).\n    *   Photons are massless, so their energy-momentum relation is $E = pc$.\n    *   The problem states their energies are equal: $E_{\\gamma 1} = E_{\\gamma 2} = E_{\\gamma}$.\n    *   Therefore, their momenta must also have the same magnitude: $p_{\\gamma 1} = p_{\\gamma 2} = p_{\\gamma} = E_{\\gamma}/c$.\n    *   Photon 1 goes \"upper-right\". Let's say it makes an angle $+\\theta$ with the horizontal axis.\n    *   Photon 2 goes \"lower-right\". Let's say it makes an angle $-\\phi$ with the horizontal axis.\n\n6.  **Apply Conservation Laws to the Final State:**\n\n    *   **Energy Conservation:**\n        *   $E_{total} = E_{\\gamma 1} + E_{\\gamma 2}$\n        *   $6 m_e c^2 = E_{\\gamma} + E_{\\gamma} = 2 E_{\\gamma}$\n        *   This gives us the energy of each photon: $E_{\\gamma} = 3 m_e c^2$.\n        *   And the magnitude of each photon's momentum: $p_{\\gamma} = E_{\\gamma}/c = 3 m_e c$.\n\n    *   **Momentum Conservation (y-component):**\n        *   The initial y-momentum was 0. The final y-momentum must also be 0.\n        *   $P_{final, y} = p_{\\gamma 1, y} + p_{\\gamma 2, y} = 0$\n        *   $p_{\\gamma} \\sin(\\theta) + p_{\\gamma} \\sin(-\\phi) = 0$\n        *   $p_{\\gamma} \\sin(\\theta) - p_{\\gamma} \\sin(\\phi) = 0$\n        *   Since $p_{\\gamma}$ is not zero, this implies $\\sin(\\theta) = \\sin(\\phi)$, which means $\\theta = \\phi$.\n        *   So, the angles are symmetric about the x-axis: one photon goes at $+\\theta$, the other at $-\\theta$.\n\n    *   **Momentum Conservation (x-component):**\n        *   The initial x-momentum must equal the final x-momentum.\n        *   $P_{total, x} = P_{final, x}$\n        *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = p_{\\gamma 1, x} + p_{\\gamma 2, x}$\n        *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = p_{\\gamma} \\cos(\\theta) + p_{\\gamma} \\cos(-\\theta)$\n        *   Since $\\cos(-\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)$, this simplifies:\n        *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 p_{\\gamma} \\cos(\\theta)$\n        *   Now I can substitute the value I found for $p_{\\gamma}$:\n        *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 (3 m_e c) \\cos(\\theta)$\n        *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 6 m_e c \\cos(\\theta)$\n        *   The terms $m_e c$ cancel out.\n        *   $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Angle:**\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons. This angle is $\\theta - (-\\theta) = 2\\theta$.\n    *   First, I need to calculate $\\theta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}\\right)$.\n    *   Then I will double it to get the final answer. I will use a code interpreter for the numerical calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value inside the arccos function\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate the angle theta in degrees\ntheta_degrees = math.degrees(math.acos(cos_theta))\n\n# The angle between the photons is 2 * theta\nangle_between_photons = 2 * theta_degrees\n\nprint(angle_between_photons)\n```\n\n> 138.1759616091448\n\nThe calculated angle is approximately 138.18 degrees.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the System and Coordinates**\n    *   We'll set the horizontal axis as the x-axis. The electron moves from left to right, so its velocity is in the +x direction.\n    *   The positron moves from right to left, so its velocity is in the -x direction.\n    *   The electron rest mass ($m_e$) and positron rest mass ($m_p$) are identical. Let's call it $m_0$.\n    *   The speed of light is $c$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Energy and Momentum**\n    The total energy and momentum of the system before the collision must be conserved. We use the relativistic formulas:\n    *   Energy: $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n    *   Momentum: $p = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\cdot m_0 c$\n\n    *   **For the electron (e-)**:\n        *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n        *   Energy $E_e = 4 m_0 c^2$.\n        *   Momentum $p_e = \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} \\cdot m_0 c = \\sqrt{15} \\cdot m_0 c$. (in the +x direction)\n\n    *   **For the positron (e+)**:\n        *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n        *   Energy $E_p = 2 m_0 c^2$.\n        *   Momentum $p_p = \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} \\cdot m_0 c = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot m_0 c$. (in the -x direction)\n\n    *   **Total Initial System**:\n        *   Total Energy ($E_{total}$): $E_{total} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_0 c^2 + 2 m_0 c^2 = 6 m_0 c^2$.\n        *   Total Momentum in the x-direction ($P_{x, total}$): Momentum is a vector, so we subtract the positron's momentum. $P_{x, total} = p_e - p_p = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_0 c$.\n        *   Total Momentum in the y-direction ($P_{y, total}$): Since both particles move horizontally, $P_{y, total} = 0$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation)**\n    *   Two photons are produced. Let's call them $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$.\n    *   The problem states their energies are equal: $E_{\\gamma_1} = E_{\\gamma_2} = E_{\\gamma}$.\n    *   For a photon, energy and momentum are related by $E = pc$. Therefore, their momenta must also have the same magnitude: $p_{\\gamma_1} = p_{\\gamma_2} = p_{\\gamma}$.\n    *   Photon 1 moves \"upper-right\" at an angle $\\theta$ to the x-axis. Photon 2 moves \"lower-right\" at an angle $-\\phi$ to the x-axis.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy**:\n        *   The total energy after annihilation must equal the total initial energy.\n        *   $E_{\\gamma_1} + E_{\\gamma_2} = E_{total}$\n        *   $2 E_{\\gamma} = 6 m_0 c^2$\n        *   $E_{\\gamma} = 3 m_0 c^2$. This is the energy of each photon.\n        *   The momentum of each photon is $p_{\\gamma} = E_{\\gamma} / c = 3 m_0 c$.\n\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum**:\n        *   The total momentum after annihilation must be the same as before.\n        *   **Y-component**: The initial y-momentum was 0. The final y-momentum must also be 0.\n            *   $P_{y, final} = p_{\\gamma} \\sin(\\theta) + p_{\\gamma} \\sin(-\\phi) = p_{\\gamma}(\\sin(\\theta) - \\sin(\\phi)) = 0$.\n            *   This implies $\\sin(\\theta) = \\sin(\\phi)$, so the angles are symmetric: $\\theta = \\phi$. One photon goes at an angle $+\\theta$ and the other at $-\\theta$.\n        *   **X-component**: The initial x-momentum must equal the final x-momentum.\n            *   $P_{x, final} = p_{\\gamma} \\cos(\\theta) + p_{\\gamma} \\cos(-\\theta) = 2 p_{\\gamma} \\cos(\\theta)$.\n            *   $P_{x, final} = P_{x, total}$\n            *   $2 p_{\\gamma} \\cos(\\theta) = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_0 c$.\n            *   Substitute the value of $p_{\\gamma} = 3 m_0 c$:\n            *   $2 (3 m_0 c) \\cos(\\theta) = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_0 c$.\n            *   $6 \\cos(\\theta) = \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}$.\n            *   $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Angle**\n    *   We need to find the angle *between* the two photons, which is $\\theta - (-\\theta) = 2\\theta$.\n    *   First, we find $\\theta$ by taking the arccosine of the expression above.

Define Final State and Apply Conservation Laws**\n\nThe final state consists of two photons. Let's say one photon moves at an angle $+\\theta$ and the other at an angle $-\\theta$ with respect to the initial horizontal axis (the x-axis). The symmetry in the angle is required by the conservation of momentum in the y-direction, as the initial y-momentum was zero.\n\n*   For a photon, the energy-momentum relation is $E = pc$.\n*   The problem states the energies of the two photons are equal ($E_{\\gamma 1} = E_{\\gamma 2} = E_{\\gamma}$). This means their momenta also have the same magnitude ($p_{\\gamma 1} = p_{\\gamma 2} = p_{\\gamma}$).\n\n**Conservation of Energy:**\n*   $E_{total, final} = E_{total, initial}$\n*   $E_{\\gamma} + E_{\\gamma} = 6 m_0 c^2$\n*   $2E_{\\gamma} = 6 m_0 c^2 \\implies E_{\\gamma} = 3 m_0 c^2$\n*   Therefore, the momentum of each photon is $p_{\\gamma} = E_{\\gamma} / c = 3 m_0 c$.\n\n**Conservation of Momentum (in the x-direction):**\n*   The x-component of each photon's momentum is $p_{\\gamma} \\cos(\\theta)$.\n*   $P_{x, total, final} = P_{x, total, initial}$\n*   $p_{\\gamma} \\cos(\\theta) + p_{\\gamma} \\cos(\\theta) = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_0 c$\n*   $2 p_{\\gamma} \\cos(\\theta) = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_0 c$\n*   Substitute the value we found for $p_{\\gamma}$:\n*   $2 (3 m_0 c) \\cos(\\theta) = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_0 c$\n*   $6 \\cos(\\theta) = \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n\n**3.
