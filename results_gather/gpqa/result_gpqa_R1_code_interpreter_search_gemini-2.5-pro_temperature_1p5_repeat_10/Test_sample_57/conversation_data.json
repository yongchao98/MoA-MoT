    "*   **Classical Electrodynamics (B):** This theory suffers from the \"self-energy\" problem of a point charge. If you calculate the energy stored in the electric field of an electron assuming it is a point, the energy becomes infinite as you approach the point. This is a high-energy (or short-distance) divergence that requires a form of regularization, such as assuming the electron has a small, finite radius.\n\n*   **Quantum Electrodynamics (C) and Quantum Chromodynamics (D):** Both of these are Quantum Field Theories (QFTs). When calculating physical quantities using perturbation theory (Feynman diagrams), loop integrals often diverge at high energies (large momenta), a problem known as an \"ultraviolet (UV) divergence\". To handle these infinities, a two-step process is used: 1) **Regularization**, where the integral is mathematically modified to make it finite (e.g., by introducing an energy cutoff or using dimensional regularization), and 2) **Renormalization**, where these artificial modifications are removed by absorbing the infinite parts into the definitions of physical constants like mass and charge. Therefore, both QED and QCD critically require regularization.\n\n*   **Superstring Theory (A):** One of the primary motivations for superstring theory is that it is believed to be a UV-finite theory of quantum gravity. In string theory, fundamental particles are not point-like but are instead one-dimensional \"strings\". This extended nature of strings smooths out interactions at very short distances (high energies). As a result, the calculations of scattering amplitudes in string theory do not produce the ultraviolet divergences that plague standard QFTs. Therefore, superstring theory is formulated in a way that is not expected to require regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<A>>>"
