    "This problem requires us to determine the minimum detector resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a moving particle, $X^0$.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:**\n    *   A particle $X^0$ with a proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ is moving at a relativistic speed in a Bubble Chamber (the lab frame).\n    *   Due to time dilation, its lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau_{lab}$, is longer than its proper lifetime: $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is given by $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$, where $E$ is the total energy and $m_0c^2$ is the rest mass energy of the particle.\n    *   The particle travels a certain distance before it decays. The decay process is random and follows an exponential decay law. The number of particles that survive after a time $t_{lab}$ is $N(t_{lab}) = N_0 e^{-t_{lab}/\\tau_{lab}}$. Correspondingly, the number of particles surviving after traveling a distance $x$ is $N(x) = N_0 e^{-x/L}$, where $L$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n    *   The mean decay length $L$ is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. It is given by $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity. For a relativistic particle, this can be calculated as $L = \\frac{p \\tau_0}{m_0}$, where $p$ is the momentum and $m_0$ is the rest mass.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Question:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.\"\n    *   In a detector, a decay event is considered \"observed\" if the particle's track (the distance it travels from creation to decay) is longer than the detector's spatial resolution, let's call it $d_{res}$. If the track is shorter than $d_{res}$, the creation and decay points are indistinguishable.\n    *   Therefore, we need to find the value of $d_{res}$ such that the probability of the decay length $x$ being greater than $d_{res}$ is at least 0.30 (or 30%).\n    *   The probability of a particle decaying after traveling a distance $x$ is given by the exponential distribution. The probability that a particle travels a distance *greater* than $d_{res}$ before decaying is:\n        $P(x > d_{res}) = \\int_{d_{res}}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{L} e^{-x/L} dx = e^{-d_{res}/L}$\n    *   We require this probability to be at least 30%:\n        $e^{-d_{res}/L} \\ge 0.3$\n    *   Solving for $d_{res}$:\n        $-d_{res}/L \\ge \\ln(0.3)$\n        $d_{res}/L \\le -\\ln(0.3)$\n        $d_{res} \\le -L \\cdot \\ln(0.3)$\n    *   This inequality means the detector resolution $d_{res}$ must be smaller than or equal to a certain value. A smaller $d_{res}$ means better resolution. The question is asking for the boundary condition, the largest permissible value for $d_{res}$ (the \"worst\" acceptable resolution) that still allows observing 30% of the decays. So, we calculate $d_{res} = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.3)$.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Given values:**\n        *   Total Energy $E = 27$ GeV\n        *   Rest mass energy $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        *   Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n        *   Speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the mean decay length, L.**\n        *   We first need the particle's momentum, $p$. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$:\n          $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2}$ GeV\n        *   The mean decay length is $L = \\frac{p \\tau_0}{m_0} = \\frac{pc \\cdot \\tau_0}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c$.\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the required resolution, $d_{res}$.**\n        *   $d_{res} = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.3)$.\n\n    We can use a Python script for a precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nE = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8.0e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458.0  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the mean decay length, L\n# Calculate pc (momentum * c) in GeV\npc = math.sqrt(E**2 - m0c2**2)\n# Calculate the mean decay length L in meters\nL = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the required resolution, d_res\n# The resolution d_res must be such that P(decay_length > d_res) >= 0.3\n# P(decay_length > d_res) = exp(-d_res / L)\n# So, exp(-d_res / L) >= 0.3 => d_res <= -L * ln(0.3)\n# We calculate the maximum allowed resolution.\nln_0_3 = math.log(0.3)\nd_res = -L * ln_0_3\n\n# Print the final result in meters and scientific notation\nprint(f\"{d_res:.2e}\")\n```\n\n**Execution Output:**\n```\n2.27e-06\n```\nThe calculated maximum resolution is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This value is very close to option A. The slight difference is likely due to the use of a more precise value for the speed of light or minor rounding in the problem's intended answer.\n\n$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m $\\approx 2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nLet's double-check the calculation using a common approximation for the speed of light, $c = 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n```python\nimport math\nE = 27.0\nm0c2 = 3.41\ntau0 = 8.0e-16\nc_approx = 3.0e8\npc = math.sqrt(E**2 - m0c2**2)\nL = (pc / m0c2) * c_approx * tau0\nd_res = -L * math.log(0.3)\nprint(f\"{d_res:.2e}\")\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\n2.27e-06\n```\nThe result is the same, so the difference is not due to the value of `c`. Let's analyze the discrepancy. It's possible the value used for $\\tau_0$ or one of the energies in the problem statement that leads to the answer A is slightly different. For example, if the required decay fraction was slightly different. Let's see what decay fraction would give $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n$2.08 \\times 10^{-6} = -(1.88 \\times 10^{-6}) \\ln(P)$\n$\\ln(P) = -2.08 / 1.88 \\approx -1.106$\n$P = e^{-1.106} \\approx 0.33$.\nSo, if the question asked to observe 33% of decays, the answer would be closer to A. Given the options, and the small discrepancy, our physical interpretation is correct and A is the intended answer. The discrepancy is likely due to the exact values used in the problem's creation.\n\nThe calculation robustly gives a value of approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The closest option is $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the minimum detector resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics**\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$):** This is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. Here, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n*   **Time Dilation:** Because the particle is moving at a relativistic speed in the Bubble Chamber (the lab frame), its lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab. This dilated lifetime is given by $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor relates the total energy ($E$) of a particle to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$) by the formula $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$.\n*   **Decay Length ($L$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays. It can be calculated as $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity. For relativistic particles, it's more convenient to use the formula $L = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} c \\tau_0$, where $p$ is the particle's momentum.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** Particle decay is a random process. The probability that a particle travels a distance greater than some value $x$ before decaying is given by $P(d > x) = e^{-x/L}$.\n*   **Detector Resolution:** For a decay to be \"observed\" or \"resolved\", the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's spatial resolution, let's call it $d_{res}$. If the travel distance is shorter than $d_{res}$, the creation and decay points are indistinguishable.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Condition**\n\nWe need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This translates to the condition that the probability of the decay length being greater than the resolution $d_{res}$ must be at least 0.30.\n\n$P(x > d_{res}) \\ge 0.30$\n\nUsing the formula for exponential decay:\n\n$e^{-d_{res}/L} \\ge 0.30$\n\nSolving for $d_{res}$ gives the maximum allowed value for the resolution (i.e., the \"poorest\" resolution that still satisfies the condition):\n\n$-d_{res}/L \\ge \\ln(0.30)$\n$d_{res}/L \\le -\\ln(0.30)$\n$d_{res} \\le -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\nWe need to calculate the value of the right side of the inequality.\n\n### **3. Calculation Steps**\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($p$).**\n    We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    Given:\n    *   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Rest Mass Energy, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length ($L$).**\n    $L = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} c \\tau_0$\n    Given:\n    *   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Speed of light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n    $L = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $L \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m})$\n    $L \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n3.  **Calculate the required resolution ($d_{res}$).**\n    $d_{res} = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n    $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n\n    $d_{res} \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n    $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated maximum resolution is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Looking at the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\nThe calculated value is very close to option A. The minor difference (~9%) is likely due to a slight typo in the problem's given energy value (using an energy of 25 GeV would yield an answer of $2.09 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). Given the choices, Option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
