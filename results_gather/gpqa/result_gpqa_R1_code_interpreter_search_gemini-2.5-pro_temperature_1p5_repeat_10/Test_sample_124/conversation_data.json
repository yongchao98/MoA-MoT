    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:**\n    The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. Since $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ in Cartesian coordinates, the potential can be written as $V(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This is the potential of a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. \"Isotropic\" means that the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three directions.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the Hamiltonian is separable in Cartesian coordinates. This means we can treat it as three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators, one for each coordinate (x, y, z).\n    The energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator in the state $n_i$ is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$.\n    The total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three 1D oscillators:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n3.  **Identify the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The energy levels are ordered by the value of the principal quantum number $n$.\n    *   **Ground State:** $n=0$. Energy is $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $n=1$. Energy is $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $n=2$. Energy is $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $n=3$. Energy is $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same principal quantum number $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n=3$.\n    The general formula for the degeneracy of the n-th level is $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.\n    For the third excited state ($n=3$), the degeneracy is:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, we can list the combinations explicitly:\n    *   One quantum number is 3: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). (3 states)\n    *   One quantum number is 2, another is 1: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). (6 states)\n    *   All quantum numbers are 1: (1,1,1). (1 state)\n    Total number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n    The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level is 10.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated energy is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and the degeneracy is 10.\n    Let's check the options:\n    A) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 10 - Incorrect energy expression.\n    B) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 3 - Incorrect energy and degeneracy.\n    C) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, 10 - Matches our calculation for both energy and degeneracy.\n    D) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, 3 - Correct energy but incorrect degeneracy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
