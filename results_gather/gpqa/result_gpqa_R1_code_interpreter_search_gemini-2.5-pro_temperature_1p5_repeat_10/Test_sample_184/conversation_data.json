    "An elegant way to solve this problem is by examining the square of the Hamiltonian operator, $H^2$.\n\n1.  **Define the Hamiltonian:**\n    The Hamiltonian is given by $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}$, where:\n    *   $\\varepsilon$ is a constant with the dimension of energy.\n    *   $\\vec{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is an arbitrary unit vector, meaning $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n2.  **Calculate the square of the Hamiltonian, $H^2$:**\n    $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2$\n\n3.  **Evaluate $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2$:**\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = (n_x \\sigma_x + n_y \\sigma_y + n_z \\sigma_z)^2$\n    This can be expanded, but it is more efficient to use the known identity for Pauli matrices:\n    $(\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})(\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}) = (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b})I + i(\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b}) \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n    where $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are any two vectors and $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n    In our case, $\\vec{a} = \\vec{b} = \\vec{n}$. Substituting this into the identity:\n    $(\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})(\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}) = (\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{n})I + i(\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n}) \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n\n    We know two vector properties:\n    *   The dot product of a vector with itself is the square of its magnitude: $\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{n} = |\\vec{n}|^2$. Since $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$.\n    *   The cross product of a vector with itself is the zero vector: $\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n} = \\vec{0}$.\n\n    Substituting these back into the equation:\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = (1)I + i(\\vec{0}) \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = I$\n\n4.  **Relate $H^2$ to the eigenvalues:**\n    Now we can find $H^2$:\n    $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$\n\n    Let $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of the operator $H$, and $|\\psi\\rangle$ be the corresponding non-zero eigenvector. By definition:\n    $H|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda|\\psi\\rangle$\n\n    Applying the operator $H$ again to both sides:\n    $H(H|\\psi\\rangle) = H(\\lambda|\\psi\\rangle)$\n    $H^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda(H|\\psi\\rangle)$\n    $H^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda(\\lambda|\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda^2|\\psi\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Solve for the eigenvalues $\\lambda$:**\n    We now have two expressions for $H^2|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    1.  $H^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda^2|\\psi\\rangle$\n    2.  $H^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\varepsilon^2 I |\\psi\\rangle = \\varepsilon^2|\\psi\\rangle$\n\n    Equating these two expressions:\n    $\\lambda^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\varepsilon^2|\\psi\\rangle$\n    $(\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2)|\\psi\\rangle = 0$\n\n    Since $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenvector, it cannot be the zero vector. Therefore, the scalar multiple must be zero:\n    $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2 = 0$\n    $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$\n    $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$\n\nThe eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) $+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2$\nB) $+1, -1$\nC) $+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2$\nD) $+ \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon$\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
