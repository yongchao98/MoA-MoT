    "*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a carboxylic acid dimer, which is broadened due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, specifically one that is part of a carboxylic acid (~1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl-hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic fragmentation pattern for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion.\n\n*   **Synthesis of Spectral Data:**\n    *   The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H, C=O) and Mass Spec (m/z=45) strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   The evidence from FTIR (C=C stretch) and 1H NMR (vinyl-hydrogens) confirms the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (an alkene).\n\n*   **Determining the Correct Formula using Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    Our molecule has:\n    1.  One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid), which accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    2.  One C=C double bond (from the alkene), which accounts for another degree of unsaturation.\n    Therefore, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for the unknown compound is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches the required DoU.\n    *   **C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This does not match. A molecule with this formula and a carboxylic acid group (like hexanoic acid) would be saturated and would not have a C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The molecular formula must contain two oxygen atoms and have two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the carboxylic acid and the alkene functional groups identified in the spectra. Only the formula C6H10O2 meets both of these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>"
