    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Vector Field**\n\nThe problem describes a vector field `f(r)` that has the following properties:\n*   It is directed radially outward from the origin.\n*   Its magnitude depends only on the distance `r` from the origin and is given by `f(r) = 1/r^2`.\n\nIn spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, we can express this vector field as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\nwhere `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction. This means the field has a radial component `f_r = 1/r^2`, and its other components are zero (`f_θ = 0`, `f_φ = 0`).\n\n### **2. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∇ ⋅ f`, over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\nThe integral to evaluate is: `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n### **3. Method 1: Using the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this problem. It relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the field itself:\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nwhere `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V`. In this case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral on the right-hand side:\n\n*   **The vector field `f` on the surface `S`:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the field `f` on the surface is `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n*   **The surface element vector `dS`:** For a sphere, the infinitesimal surface element vector `dS` points in the direction of the outward normal. The outward normal to a sphere is simply the radial unit vector `r̂`. So, `dS = dS * r̂`, where `dS` is the magnitude of the area element.\n*   **The dot product `f ⋅ dS`:**\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [dS * r̂]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * dS`\n*   **The surface integral:**\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) * dS`\n    Since `R` is a constant over the entire surface of integration, we can take `1/R^2` outside the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n*   **Final evaluation:** The integral `∮_S dS` is simply the total surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n    Therefore, the value of the integral is:\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2) = 4π`\n\nSo, by the Divergence Theorem, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`.\n\n### **4. Method 2: Direct Calculation of the Divergence (Conceptual Check)**\n\nLet's try to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + (terms involving f_θ and f_φ)`\n\nSince `f_θ = f_φ = 0`, the formula simplifies to:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`\n\nSubstitute `f_r = 1/r^2`:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n\nThis calculation shows that the divergence is zero *everywhere except at the origin (r=0)*. At `r=0`, the field `f` is undefined (it blows up), and so is its divergence. This type of field, which is analogous to the electric field of a point charge, has a \"source\" at the origin. The divergence at this point is not zero; it is a three-dimensional Dirac delta function:\n`∇ ⋅ (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`\n\nNow, we can evaluate the volume integral:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV`\n\nBy the definition of the Dirac delta function, integrating it over a volume that contains the origin (`r=0`) yields 1. Since the sphere of radius `R` is centered at the origin, it contains the point `r=0`.\n`∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV = 4π * ∫_V δ³(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`\n\nBoth methods give the same result. The result `4π` is a constant and is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere, as long as `R>0` (the sphere encloses the source at the origin).\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe value of the volume integral of the divergence is `4π`. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 0\nD) 4 π\n\nThe most appropriate answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
