    "This problem requires a multi-step calculation involving two different equilibrium expressions for phosphoric acid. First, we need to determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer solution created by KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O. Then, we can use this [H+] value to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n\nThe two salts in the solution are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O.\n*   KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates into 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and 2H2O.\n\nThe buffer system is composed of the conjugate acid-base pair H2PO4- / HPO4^2-.\n\n1.  **Calculate moles of each component:**\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n        *   Therefore, moles of H2PO4- = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n        *   Therefore, moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm3, which is 0.20000 L.\n    *   Initial concentration of H2PO4- = [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Initial concentration of HPO4^2- = [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]**\n\nThe relevant equilibrium for this buffer system is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka2:\nH2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\nKa2 = ([H+][HPO4^2-]) / [H2PO4-] = 6.2 x 10^-8\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for [H+]:\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n\nUsing the initial concentrations as a very good approximation for the equilibrium concentrations:\n[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H+] ≈ 8.11 x 10^-8 M\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]**\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, which starts from the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-). This is governed by Ka3:\nHPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\nKa3 = ([H+][PO4^3-]) / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8 x 10^-12\n\nWe rearrange this formula to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n\nWe use the equilibrium concentrations of [HPO4^2-] and [H+] calculated in the previous steps. The concentration of HPO4^2- at equilibrium is approximately its initial concentration (0.02809 M) because its further dissociation is negligible (Ka3 is very small).\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10^-8 M)\n[PO4^3-] ≈ 6.236 x 10^-7 M\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\nLet's run a single python script to perform the calculation precisely.\n```python\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.200  # L\nka2 = 6.2e-8\nka3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Calculate moles of the ions\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# Calculate initial concentrations of the ions\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume_L\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration using the buffer equation (Ka2)\n# H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nh_plus_conc = ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration using Ka3\n# HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\npo4_3minus_conc = ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / h_plus_conc)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{po4_3minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.24e-07\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 x 10^-7 M.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4³⁻) in the given solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components:** The solution contains:\n    *   KH₂PO₄: This salt dissolves completely in water to give K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate ion).\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O: This salt dissolves completely in water to give 2Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate ion) and 2 molecules of water.\n    *   Water (the solvent).\n\n3.  **Recognize the Chemical System:** The solution contains a significant amount of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). This constitutes a buffer solution. The equilibrium that governs this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄):\n    *   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   This equilibrium is described by the acid dissociation constant *K*ₐ₂.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   **Step A: Calculate initial concentrations.** Determine the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components, [H₂PO₄⁻] and [HPO₄²⁻].\n    *   **Step B: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration.** Use the buffer equilibrium (*K*ₐ₂) to find the concentration of H⁺ in the solution.\n    *   **Step C: Calculate the orthophosphate concentration.** Use the third dissociation equilibrium (*K*ₐ₃), which involves the species we are interested in (PO₄³⁻), to calculate its concentration using the [H⁺] found in Step B.\n        *   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n\n5.  **Execute the Plan:**\n\n    *   **Step A: Initial Concentrations**\n        *   Molar mass of KH₂PO₄ = 136.09 g/mol\n        *   Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 177.99 g/mol\n        *   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n        *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n        *   Since KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻, moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 0.007348 mol\n        *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n        *   Since Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O → 2Na⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ + 2H₂O, moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 0.005618 mol\n        *   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = moles / volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n        *   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = moles / volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n    *   **Step B: Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**\n        *   Use the expression for *K*ₐ₂: *K*ₐ₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n        *   Rearrange to solve for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = *K*ₐ₂ × ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        *   Plug in the values: [H⁺] = (6.2 × 10⁻⁸) × (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.112 × 10⁻⁸ M\n\n    *   **Step C: Orthophosphate Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**\n        *   Use the expression for *K*ₐ₃: *K*ₐ₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n        *   Rearrange to solve for [PO₄³⁻]: [PO₄³⁻] = *K*ₐ₃ × ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n        *   The concentration of HPO₄²⁻ is its initial concentration (0.02809 M) because its dissociation into PO₄³⁻ is very small (*K*ₐ₃ is tiny).\n        *   Plug in the values: [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 × 10⁻¹²) × (0.02809 M / (8.112 × 10⁻⁸ M))\n        *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 × 10⁻⁷ M\n\n6.  **Verify with Code:** The Python script automates the calculations from Step 5 to ensure accuracy. The code execution output was `6.24e-07`, which confirms the manual calculation.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    *   The calculated value is 6.236 × 10⁻⁷ M, which rounds to 6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M.\n    *   This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
