    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System and its States:**\n    The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n    The total number of possible configurations (microstates) for the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 2^3 = 8.\n\n2.  **Define the Energy Function (Hamiltonian):**\n    The energy of the system for a given state is given by the formula:\n    E = -J [ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]\n    Here, J is a constant representing the coupling strength.\n\n3.  **Define the Partition Function (Z):**\n    The partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system.\n    Z = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n    where β = 1/(kT), k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\n    Since some states might have the same energy (i.e., the energy levels are degenerate), the formula can be written as:\n    Z = Σ_levels g_i * e^(-βE_i)\n    where g_i is the degeneracy (number of states) of the energy level E_i.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy for Each State and Find Degeneracies:**\n    We need to systematically list all 8 states, calculate the energy for each, and then group them by energy level.\n\n    *   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n        *   State (+1, +1, +1): E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n        *   State (-1, -1, -1): E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n        These two states have the same energy, E₁ = -3J. The degeneracy of this energy level is g₁ = 2.\n\n    *   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n        This case includes configurations with two spins up and one down, or one spin up and two down.\n        *   State (+1, +1, -1): E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   State (+1, -1, +1): E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J [-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   State (-1, +1, +1): E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   State (+1, -1, -1): E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   State (-1, +1, -1): E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   State (-1, -1, +1): E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        All six of these states have the same energy, E₂ = J. The degeneracy of this energy level is g₂ = 6.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Partition Function:**\n    Now we can use the formula Z = Σ g_i * e^(-βE_i) with the energy levels and degeneracies we found.\n    *   For the energy level E₁ = -3J with degeneracy g₁ = 2, the term is: 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ).\n    *   For the energy level E₂ = J with degeneracy g₂ = 6, the term is: 6 * e^(-β(J)) = 6e^(-Jβ).\n\n    Summing these terms gives the total partition function Z:\n    Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    Let's check the options provided:\n    A) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n    B) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n    C) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n    D) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\n    Our calculated result Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
