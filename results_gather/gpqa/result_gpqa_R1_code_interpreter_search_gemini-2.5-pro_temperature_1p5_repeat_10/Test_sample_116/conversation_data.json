    "An organic compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each of the given compounds to determine if they are chiral.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This molecule belongs to a class of compounds called biphenyls. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single carbon-carbon bond.\n    *   The molecule has bulky substituents at all four ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). The substituents are nitro groups (-NO₂) at the 6 and 6' positions, and ester groups (-COOCH₃) at the 2 and 2' positions.\n    *   These bulky groups create significant steric hindrance, which restricts the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n    *   This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, locks the molecule into a conformation where the two phenyl rings are not in the same plane (non-coplanar).\n    *   This fixed, non-planar structure lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   Consequently, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   This is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   To check for chirality, we look for chiral centers (stereocenters). A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        2.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The molecule is not chiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the carbon and oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Since it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar. More importantly, it has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nBased on the analysis, only compounds 1 (due to atropisomerism) and 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral.\n\nThus, the correct option includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
