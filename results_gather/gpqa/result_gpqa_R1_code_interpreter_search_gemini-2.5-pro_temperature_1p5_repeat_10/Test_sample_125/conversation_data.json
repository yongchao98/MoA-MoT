    "This question asks for the number of peaks observed in two different types of HPLC experiments (normal-phase and chiral) for a mixture of reaction products. To answer this, we need to determine the products of each reaction and then analyze how they would be separated by each chromatographic technique.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule, as indicated by the (S) designation for the stereocenter at carbon 5. The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The starting material is enantiomerically pure.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at carbon 3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The carbonyl carbon is prochiral, meaning the hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either face (top or bottom).\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** Since the original chiral center at C5 is unaffected by the reaction, it remains in the (S) configuration. The new chiral center at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in the formation of two products:\n    *   Product A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** Products A and B have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of their two chiral centers. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its products**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃). This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent, and \"excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol (CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃). The reduction creates two new chiral centers at carbons 2 and 4.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. We must consider the configurations at C2 and C4.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (which is identical to (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are **enantiomers** and are formed as a 1:1 mixture, known as a racemic mixture. Let's call these Product C and Product D.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. Let's call this Product E.\n    *   The meso compound (E) is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomers (C and D).\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces a total of **three stereoisomers**: one racemic pair (C and D) and one meso compound (E).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the separation of the combined product mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers: A, B, C, D, and E.\n\n**A. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Separation)**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties (including polarity). It **cannot** separate enantiomers, which have identical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    1.  **Products A and B:** They are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  **Products C and D:** They are enantiomers. They have identical polarities and will not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak** for the pair.\n    3.  **Product E:** This is a meso compound. It is a diastereomer of C and D. It has different physical properties and polarity and will be separated from the peak containing C and D. This gives **1 peak**.\n    4.  **Products from Rxn I vs. Rxn II:** The products from Reaction I (5-methoxyhexan-3-ols) and Reaction II (pentane-2,4-diols) are structurally very different (different molecular formulas, C₇H₁₆O₂ vs. C₅H₁₂O₂). They will have different polarities and will be easily separated from each other.\n\n*   **Total Peaks:** We have four separable groups: A, B, (C+D), and E. Therefore, the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will show **4 peaks**.\n\n**B. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Separation)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all stereoisomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:** The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers (A, B, C, D, E). A chiral column is designed to resolve such a mixture.\n    1.  **Product A:** ((3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) -> **1 peak**\n    2.  **Product B:** ((3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) -> **1 peak** (separated from A)\n    3.  **Product C:** ((2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol) -> **1 peak**\n    4.  **Product D:** ((2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) -> **1 peak** (separated from its enantiomer, C)\n    5.  **Product E:** (meso-pentane-2,4-diol) -> **1 peak** (separated from its diastereomers, C and D)\n\n*   **Total Peaks:** Each of the five stereoisomers will be resolved. Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
