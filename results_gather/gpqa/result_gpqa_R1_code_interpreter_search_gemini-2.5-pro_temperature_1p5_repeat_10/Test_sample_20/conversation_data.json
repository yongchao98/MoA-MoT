    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a phenomenon where a single compound exists in two or more interconvertible forms that are in equilibrium. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. For keto-enol tautomerism to occur, there must be at least one **α-hydrogen** on an **sp³-hybridized carbon** adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups at opposite positions (1 and 4). The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the α-carbons) are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized and do not have the required α-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This is a saturated six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are α-carbons. Each of these carbons is sp³-hybridized and is bonded to two hydrogen atoms (α-hydrogens). The presence of these α-hydrogens allows it to undergo tautomerism to form its enol, which is phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is aromatic and thus very stable, meaning the equilibrium strongly favors the enol form. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one with the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will exist as a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is a trans-alkene with an ester group (COOCH₃) on each of the double-bonded carbons. There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination**\n    *   A (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n    *   B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
