    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem involves a conservative force (Hook's law), so the total energy of the system is conserved. In a relativistic context, the total energy includes the relativistic energy of the mass and the potential energy of the spring.\n\n2.  **Define the total energy of the system:**\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light. This total energy includes the rest energy $mc^2$ and the kinetic energy $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\n    *   The potential energy stored in the spring when it is stretched or compressed by a distance $x$ from its equilibrium position is given by $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    *   The total conserved energy of the system (mass + spring) is the sum of these two:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy at two key points in the oscillation:**\n\n    *   **Point 1: At maximum amplitude ($x=A$)**\n        *   The mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v=0$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **Point 2: At the equilibrium position ($x=0$)**\n        *   The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n        *   The mass has its maximum speed, $v=v_{max}$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n4.  **Equate the total energy expressions from the two points:**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at maximum amplitude must equal the energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$:**\n    *   First, isolate the term containing $v_{max}$. Divide the entire equation by $mc^2$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   To get rid of the square root, square both sides of the equation:\n        $(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n    *   Take the reciprocal of both sides to bring the term with $v_{max}$ to the numerator:\n        $\\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    The derived expression $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
