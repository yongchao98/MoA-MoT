    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information and the Goal:**\n    *   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's own reference frame (the proper time) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n2.  **Recall the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   **Time Dilation:** An observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). The time `Δt` measured in the stationary frame is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n        where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Distance:** The distance traveled in any frame is the velocity in that frame multiplied by the time elapsed in that frame. In the Galaxy's reference frame, this is:\n        `d = v * Δt`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor depends on the ratio of the object's speed `v` to the speed of light `c`. The formula is:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   First, we calculate `v/c`. We'll use `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n        `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, we plug this value into the Lorentz factor formula:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula `Δt = γ * Δt₀`:\n        `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   Now we use the distance formula `d = v * Δt` with the values for `v` and the calculated `Δt`:\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   We need to compute the numerical value to compare with the options. We can use a calculator or a simple script for this.\n\nLet's perform the calculation with a Python script for accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Speed of light in km/s\nc = 300000\n\n# Velocity of the ejecta in km/s\nv = 60000\n\n# Proper time in the ejecta's frame in seconds\ndt0 = 50\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n>>>\n3061862.178478369\n>>>\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 2 880 000 km\nB) 3 000 000 km (This would be the answer if relativistic effects were ignored)\nC) 3 060 000 km\nD) 2 940 000 km\n\nThe calculated value `3,061,862 km` is closest to option C, `3,060,000 km`.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   We have two inertial frames of reference: the Galaxy's frame (let's call it `S`) and the ejecta's frame (let's call it `S'`).\n    *   The ejecta (`S'`) is moving relative to the Galaxy (`S`) with a velocity `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Understand the Given Time:**\n    *   The problem states that 50 seconds pass *in the ejecta reference frame*. This is the proper time, `Δt₀`, because it's the time measured in the frame that is at rest with respect to the \"event\" (the ticking of a clock on the ejecta).\n    *   So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n\n3.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    *   An observer in the Galaxy's frame (`S`) will observe time passing more slowly for the moving ejecta (`S'`). The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`, is longer than the proper time `Δt₀`.\n    *   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   Here, `v = 60,000 km/s` and the speed of light `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`, also known as beta (`β`):\n        `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Now we use the time dilation formula to find the time elapsed as measured by an observer in the Galaxy:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n        `Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame:**\n    *   The distance traveled by the ejecta, as measured in the Galaxy's frame, is the velocity of the ejecta in that frame (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in that same frame (`Δt`).\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   `d = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / sqrt(0.96))`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   As computed by the Python script:\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n    *   Comparing this result to the options provided:\n        A) 2,880,000 km\n        B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the incorrect, non-relativistic answer: `60,000 km/s * 50 s`)\n        C) 3,060,000 km\n        D) 2,940,000 km\n    *   The calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
