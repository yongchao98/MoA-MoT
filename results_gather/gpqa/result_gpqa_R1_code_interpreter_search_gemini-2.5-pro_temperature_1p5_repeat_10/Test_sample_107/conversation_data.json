    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nThe core of the question is to compare the magnitudes of two distinct energy quantities related to the Hydrogen atom:\n1.  **Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\langle H \\rangle$)**: This is the energy shift of an atomic level due to the interaction of the electron's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as the Zeeman effect.\n2.  **Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**: This is the energy difference between two atomic levels, which corresponds to the emission or absorption of a photon with a specific wavelength.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\langle H \\rangle$)\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the interaction of the orbital magnetic moment ($\\vec{\\mu}_L$) with an external magnetic field ($\\vec{B}$) is:\n$$ H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B} $$\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum ($\\vec{L}$) by the formula:\n$$ \\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} $$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the electron mass.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian, we get:\n$$ H = \\left(-\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}\\right) \\cdot \\vec{B} = \\frac{e}{2m_e} (\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}) $$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field is parallel to the z-axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$. The dot product simplifies to:\n$$ \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B $$\n\nTherefore, the Hamiltonian operator is:\n$$ H = \\frac{eB}{2m_e}L_z $$\n\nThe expectation value of this energy, $\\langle H \\rangle$, for a quantum state with orbital magnetic quantum number $m_l$ (denoted as 'm' in the question) is:\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e}\\langle L_z \\rangle $$\n\nThe eigenvalue of the $L_z$ operator is $m_l \\hbar$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. Thus, $\\langle L_z \\rangle = m_l \\hbar$.\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle = m_l \\left(\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}\\right) B $$\n\nThe term in the parenthesis is a fundamental physical constant known as the **Bohr magneton**, $\\mu_B$.\n$$ \\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T} $$\n\nSo the paramagnetic coupling energy is:\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle = m_l \\mu_B B $$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $B = 1$ T\n*   $m_l$ is a small integer (for example, $m_l=1$).\n\nLet's calculate $\\langle H \\rangle$ for $m_l=1$:\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T}) $$\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV} $$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the formula:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\nwhere $h$ is the Planck constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nA convenient form of this relation is using the product $hc$ in units of eVÂ·nm:\n$$ hc \\approx 1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm} $$\n\nThe given wavelength is $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu m$. We need to convert this to nanometers:\n$$ \\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu m \\times \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{nm}}{1 \\, \\mu m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm} $$\n\nNow, we can calculate $\\Delta E$:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV} $$\n\n(Note: This wavelength, 486.1 nm, corresponds to the blue-green Balmer-beta line of the hydrogen spectrum, which is the transition from the $n=4$ to the $n=2$ energy level).\n\n### 4. Comparing the Magnitudes\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic Coupling Energy: $\\langle H \\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n*   Transition Energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nTo see the relationship between them, let's find their ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\langle H \\rangle} = \\frac{2.55 \\, \\text{eV}}{5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 44000 \\approx 4.4 \\times 10^4 $$\n\nThis result shows that the transition energy $\\Delta E$ is more than four orders of magnitude larger than the paramagnetic coupling energy $\\langle H \\rangle$. In other words, the paramagnetic coupling energy is significantly smaller than the transition energy.\n\nThis relationship is expressed as:\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle \\ll \\Delta E $$\n\n### 5. Final Answer Selection\n\nBased on the comparison, the correct option is the one that indicates $\\langle H \\rangle$ is much, much less than $\\Delta E$.\n\n*   A) $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle >\\Delta E$ (Incorrect)\n*   B) $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\gg\\Delta E$ (Incorrect)\n*   C) $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E$ (Correct)\n*   D) $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle =\\Delta E$ (Incorrect)\n\n<<<C>>>"
