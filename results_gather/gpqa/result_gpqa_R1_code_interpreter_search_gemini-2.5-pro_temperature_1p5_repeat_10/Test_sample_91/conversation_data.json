    "Here's a step-by-step calculation to determine the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe given compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nFirst, we need to count the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms to determine the molecular formula.\n*   **(CH3)2C=**: 1 central carbon + 2 carbons in methyl groups = 3 C; 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n*   **=CH-**: 1 C; 1 H.\n*   **-CH2-**: 1 C; 2 H.\n*   **-CH(CH3)-**: 1 chain carbon + 1 methyl carbon = 2 C; 1 chain H + 3 methyl H = 4 H.\n*   **-CH2-**: 1 C; 2 H.\n*   **-CH=**: 1 C; 1 H.\n*   **=C(CH3)2**: 1 central carbon + 2 carbons in methyl groups = 3 C; 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   Total Carbons (C) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n*   Total Hydrogens (H) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n12 C(solid, graphite) + 11 H2(gas) → C12H22(gas)\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break the reactants into individual gaseous atoms:\n12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n\nUsing the given data:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.\n*   Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol (This is the energy to break one mole of H2 into 2 moles of H atoms).\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization (ΔH_atom):\nΔH_atom = (12 mol × ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 mol × BE(H-H))\nΔH_atom = (12 × 1000 kJ) + (11 × 100 kJ)\nΔH_atom = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ\nΔH_atom = **13100 kJ**\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product Molecule**\n\nWe need to count the number of each type of bond in the C12H22 molecule.\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly shows two double bonds: (CH3)2**C=C**H- and -C**H=C**(CH3)2. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: The molecule is acyclic. For any acyclic hydrocarbon, the total number of carbon-carbon bonds (single, double, triple) is n-1, where n is the number of carbon atoms. Here, n=12, so there are 11 C-C bonds in total. Since 2 are double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\nNow, calculate the total bond energy of the molecule (ΔH_bonds), which is the energy released when the molecule is formed from its gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol.\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol.\n\nTotal bond energy (ΔH_bonds):\nΔH_bonds = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is calculated using the following relationship:\nΔHf = (Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of the product)\nΔHf = ΔH_atom - ΔH_bonds\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔHf = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Check the Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the given options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 1900 kJ/g\nC) 11.44 kJ/g\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nOur calculated value in kJ/mol (1900) does not match option A. Option B has the correct numerical value but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). Option D is the total bond energy, not the enthalpy of formation.\nLet's convert our result to kJ/g to check option C.\n\nMolar Mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nΔHf in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.445 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n```python\n# Molecular formula: C12H22\n# Number of C atoms\nnum_C = 12\n# Number of H atoms\nnum_H = 22\n# Number of H2 molecules\nnum_H2 = num_H / 2\n\n# Given values\nenthalpy_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_H_H = 100   # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_C = 200   # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_eq_C = 300 # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_H = 400   # kJ/mol\n\n# Calculate enthalpy of atomization of reactants\nenthalpy_atomization_reactants = (num_C * enthalpy_atom_C) + (num_H2 * bond_energy_H_H)\n\n# Count bonds in C12H22\nnum_C_H_bonds = 22\nnum_C_eq_C_bonds = 2\nnum_C_C_bonds = 9 # Total C-C bonds in acyclic C12 is 11. 11 - 2 (double bonds) = 9\n\n# Calculate total bond energy of the molecule\ntotal_bond_energy_molecule = (num_C_C_bonds * bond_energy_C_C) + \\\n                               (num_C_eq_C_bonds * bond_energy_C_eq_C) + \\\n                               (num_C_H_bonds * bond_energy_C_H)\n\n# Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nenthalpy_of_formation_mol = enthalpy_atomization_reactants - total_bond_energy_molecule\n\n# Calculate molar mass using integer values as implied by the problem style\nmolar_mass_C12H22_int = (num_C * 12) + (num_H * 1)\n\n# Calculate enthalpy of formation in kJ/g\nenthalpy_of_formation_g = enthalpy_of_formation_mol / molar_mass_C12H22_int\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {enthalpy_of_formation_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {round(enthalpy_of_formation_g, 2)}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The calculation proceeds as follows:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Count Bonds:**\n*   The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n*   Counting the atoms:\n    *   Carbon (C): 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 12 C atoms.\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 H atoms.\n*   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n*   Counting the bonds within the molecule:\n    *   **C-H bonds**: The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds**: There are two double bonds, so **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds**: For a non-cyclic molecule with 'n' carbon atoms, there are a total of (n-1) carbon-carbon linkages. Here, n=12, so there are 12-1 = 11 total C-C linkages. Since 2 are double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants (ΔH_atom)**\nThe formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\nWe need to calculate the energy required to break the reactants into individual gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H2 bonds: 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   Total enthalpy of atomization = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product (ΔH_bonds)**\nThis is the energy released when forming one mole of the product from its gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Total bond energy of the molecule = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when forming the product's bonds.\n*   ΔHf = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of product)\n*   ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Convert to kJ/g to Match the Options**\nThe calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. The options are given in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. Option B has the right number but wrong units. Let's check Option C by converting our answer to kJ/g.\n*   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.445 kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches Option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
