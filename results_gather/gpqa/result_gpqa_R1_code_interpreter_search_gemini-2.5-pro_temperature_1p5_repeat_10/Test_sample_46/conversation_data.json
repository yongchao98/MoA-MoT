    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. A secondary amine (-NHR) would show only one band in this region.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch**. This frequency is typical for an **ester**. Amides usually absorb at a lower frequency (around 1650-1680 cm⁻¹).\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This triplet-quartet pattern is the classic signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The triplet (t) corresponds to the 3 protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) being split by the adjacent 2 protons of the methylene group. The quartet (q) corresponds to the 2 protons of the methylene group (-CH₂) being split by the adjacent 3 protons of the methyl group. The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet (bs) integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to factors like chemical exchange and nitrogen's quadrupolar moment.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, is a tell-tale sign of a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent to each other, and the same is true for the protons on the other side. The upfield doublet at ~7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-donating amine group, while the downfield doublet at ~8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    1.  We have a benzene ring.\n    2.  It is para-disubstituted (from the two doublets in the NMR).\n    3.  One substituent is a primary amine, -NH₂ (from IR and NMR).\n    4.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester group, -COOCH₂CH₃ (from IR and the ethyl pattern in the NMR).\n    5.  Combining these fragments gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the ethyl group would be part of a propionate group (-COCH₂CH₃). The quartet for the -CH₂- group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is an amide, not an ester, which contradicts the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. It is also a secondary amine, which contradicts the two N-H bands in the IR.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is an amide (wrong IR C=O frequency) and it is meta-disubstituted, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
