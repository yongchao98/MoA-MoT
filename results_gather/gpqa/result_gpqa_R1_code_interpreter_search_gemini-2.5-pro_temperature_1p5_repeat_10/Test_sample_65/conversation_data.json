    "The user is asking about the fundamental symmetries that must be respected by the operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Let's analyze each symmetry:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model is a relativistic quantum field theory, meaning it is invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). SMEFT is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model that preserves this fundamental principle. All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are constructed to be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry**: Poincare symmetry is a broader spacetime symmetry that includes Lorentz transformations as well as spacetime translations. It is the fundamental symmetry of special relativity. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a foundational assumption in the construction of SMEFT. Therefore, Poincare symmetry must be respected.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is the combination of Charge conjugation (C) and Parity inversion (P). The Standard Model itself is known to violate CP symmetry, which is a necessary condition to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. SMEFT provides a framework to parameterize not only the CP violation present in the Standard Model but also potential new sources of CP violation from physics at higher energy scales. Many SMEFT operators can have complex Wilson coefficients, which explicitly violate CP symmetry. Thus, CP is **not** a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is the combination of Charge conjugation, Parity inversion, and Time reversal (T). The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT-invariant. Since SMEFT is formulated as a local and Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe symmetries that are assumed to be conserved in the construction of the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. CP symmetry, on the other hand, is generally violated.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
