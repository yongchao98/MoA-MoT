    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe core of the problem is to compare two phenomena that cause a change in a star's observed brightness:\n*   **Rotational Modulation:** A star with a non-uniform surface brightness (due to starspots) will appear to change in brightness as it rotates. In this case, one hemisphere is dimmer than the other.\n*   **Exoplanet Transit:** A planet passing in front of its star blocks a small fraction of the starlight, causing a dip in brightness.\n\nThe question asks for the size of a hypothetical planet (relative to the star) that would produce a transit dip of the same magnitude as the brightness variation caused by the starspots.\n\n**2. Formulate the Brightness Variation due to Starspots**\nThe brightness (or more accurately, the flux `F`) of a star is related to its temperature `T` by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, `F ∝ T⁴`.\n\n*   Let `F_max` be the flux we observe when the clean, unspotted hemisphere is facing us. This represents the star's maximum brightness. We can normalize this to `F_max = 1`. The temperature of this face is the star's effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n\n*   Let `F_min` be the flux we observe when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. This hemisphere has a fraction `f_spot = 0.20` of its surface covered by cooler spots.\n    *   The temperature of the spots is `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average of the flux from the hot part and the cool part.\n    *   Flux from the hot part (80% of the area): `(1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴`\n    *   Flux from the cool spotty part (20% of the area): `f_spot * T_spot⁴`\n\nThe total flux `F_min`, relative to `F_max`, is:\n`F_min / F_max = (1 - f_spot) * (T_eff⁴ / T_eff⁴) + f_spot * (T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴)`\n`F_min / F_max = (1 - f_spot) + f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴`\n\nThe \"amplitude signal\" or the relative change in brightness is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux, divided by the maximum flux.\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\nSubstituting the expression for `F_min / F_max`:\n`Amplitude = 1 - [(1 - f_spot) + f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n`Amplitude = 1 - 1 + f_spot - f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴`\n`Amplitude = f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\n**3. Calculate the Numerical Value of the Spot Variation Amplitude**\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   `f_spot = 0.20`\n*   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   `T_spot = 5000 K`\n\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * 0.51775`\n`Amplitude ≈ 0.10355`\n\nSo, the star's brightness varies by about 10.36% due to the spots.\n\n**4. Formulate the Brightness Variation due to an Exoplanet Transit**\nWhen an exoplanet transits a star (that is assumed to have no spots for this part of the calculation), it blocks an amount of light proportional to its area relative to the star's area. The depth of this transit dip is given by:\n`Transit Depth = (Area_planet / Area_star_disk) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\nwhere `R_pl` is the planet's radius and `R_star` is the star's radius.\n\n**5. Equate the Two Effects and Solve for the Planet's Radius**\nThe problem states that the transit signal should have the same amplitude as the spot signal.\n`Transit Depth = Amplitude`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355`\n\nTo find the relative radius, we take the square root of this value:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is very close to 0.32.\n\nTo confirm with a calculation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given parameters\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in K\nT_spot = 5000.0 # Temperature of the spots in K\nf_spot = 0.20   # Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the amplitude of brightness variation due to spots.\n# The relative flux drop is given by Amplitude = f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4]\namplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# Step 2: The transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet is given by (R_pl / R_star)^2.\n# We set this equal to the calculated amplitude.\n# (R_pl / R_star)^2 = amplitude\n\n# Step 3: Solve for the relative radius R_pl / R_star.\nr_pl_r_star = np.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"The amplitude of brightness variation is: {amplitude:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The required relative radius of the exoplanet (R_pl / R_star) is: {r_pl_r_star:.4f}\")\n\n```\nExecuting the code gives:\n```text\nThe amplitude of brightness variation is: 0.1036\nThe required relative radius of the exoplanet (R_pl / R_star) is: 0.3218\n```\n\nThe calculated value of `~0.32` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires comparing two scenarios that cause a dip in a star's observed brightness: rotational modulation due to starspots and a planetary transit.\n\n### **1. Calculate the Brightness Variation from Starspots**\n\nThe flux (F) emitted by a star is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (T), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴). We are interested in the relative change in flux as the star rotates.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the bright, unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. We can normalize its flux to 1, with a corresponding temperature of `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere's flux is a combination of the hot, unspotted part and the cooler, spotted part.\n    *   Area of spots = 20% or `f_spot = 0.20`\n    *   Area of the hot photosphere = 80% or `1 - f_spot = 0.80`\n    *   Temperature of spots `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n\nThe total relative flux from the spotted face is the weighted average of the flux from its parts, compared to the unspotted face:\n\n`F_min / F_max = (1 - f_spot) * (T_eff / T_eff)⁴ + f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴`\n`F_min / F_max = (0.80) + (0.20) * (5000 / 6000)⁴`\n`F_min / F_max = 0.80 + 0.20 * (5/6)⁴`\n`F_min / F_max ≈ 0.80 + 0.20 * (0.48225)`\n`F_min / F_max ≈ 0.80 + 0.09645 = 0.89645`\n\nThe amplitude of the variation is the relative drop in flux:\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n`Amplitude ≈ 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355`\n\nSo, the brightness of the star drops by about 10.36% when the spotted hemisphere rotates into view.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Size**\n\nAn exoplanet transiting its star blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. This transit depth must be equal to the amplitude calculated above.\n\n`Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)`\n`Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nWe set the transit depth equal to the spot-induced amplitude:\n\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`\n\nTo find the relative radius (`R_pl / R_star`), we take the square root of this value:\n\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nA hypothetical exoplanet with a radius of about 0.32 times the radius of its star would produce a transit signal with the same amplitude as the rotational modulation caused by the described starspots. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
