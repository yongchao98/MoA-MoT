    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` approaches a circle of radius `a` as the number of sides `N` tends to infinity. The apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius `a`. The light source is monochromatic with wavelength `λ` and is incident normally on the aperture. The diffraction pattern observed in the far-field is known as the Airy pattern.\n\nThe intensity distribution of the Airy pattern is given by:\nI(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²\n\nWhere:\n*   `θ` is the angle from the central axis.\n*   `I₀` is the intensity at the center (θ = 0).\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n\nThe intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator `J₁(k * a * sinθ)` is zero, provided the denominator is non-zero. Let `zₘ` be the m-th root (or zero) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. The condition for the m-th minimum is:\n`k * a * sinθₘ = zₘ`\n\nSubstituting `k = 2π / λ`:\n`(2π / λ) * a * sinθₘ = zₘ`\n\nWe can solve for `sinθₘ`:\n`sinθₘ = (zₘ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation (`sinθ ≈ θ`), so the angular position of the m-th minimum is:\n`θₘ = (zₘ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)] - [(z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)]`\n`Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nThe first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function `J₁(x)` are approximately:\n*   z₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   z₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nNow, we can calculate the coefficient `(z₂ - z₁) / (2π)`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function J1(x)\nz1 = 3.83170597\nz2 = 7.01558667\n\n# Calculate the difference between the roots\ndelta_z = z2 - z1\n\n# Calculate the coefficient for the angular distance\ncoefficient = delta_z / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(coefficient)\n```\nThe calculated coefficient is approximately 0.5067. Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is:\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a (This is the approximate location of the first minimum, `θ₁`)\nB) 1.220 λ /a (This is related to `θ₁` using the diameter `D=2a`, but applied to radius `a` making it incorrect)\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067 λ / a` is closest to `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` will approach a circle of radius `a` as the number of sides `N` tends to infinity. The apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of the limiting circle.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture of radius `a`. This is a classic problem in optics, leading to the Airy diffraction pattern.\n\nThe intensity distribution in the far-field (Fraunhofer) region for a circular aperture is given by:\nI(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²\n\nWhere:\n*   `θ` is the angular position from the central axis.\n*   `I₀` is the maximum intensity at the center of the pattern.\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   `k` is the wave number, defined as `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the monochromatic light.\n\nThe minima (dark rings) of the diffraction pattern occur where the intensity `I(θ)` is zero. This happens when the numerator `J₁(k * a * sinθ)` is zero, as long as the denominator is non-zero (which is true for θ ≠ 0).\n\nThe angular positions of the minima are therefore found by setting the argument of the Bessel function equal to its roots (zeros). Let `zₘ` be the m-th non-zero root of `J₁(x)`.\nThe condition for the m-th minimum is:\n`k * a * sin(θₘ) = zₘ`\n\nSubstituting `k = 2π / λ`:\n`(2π / λ) * a * sin(θₘ) = zₘ`\n\nWe are given that the angles are small, so we can use the approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n`(2π / λ) * a * θₘ = zₘ`\n\nSolving for the angular position of the m-th minimum, `θₘ`:\n`θₘ = (zₘ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which corresponds to `m=1` and `m=2`.\n*   Angular position of the first minimum (`m=1`): `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n*   Angular position of the second minimum (`m=2`): `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance between them is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n`Δθ = [(z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)] - [(z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)]`\n`Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nTo find the numerical value, we need the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. These are well-known values:\n*   `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the expression for `Δθ`. The calculation was performed using the Python script:\n`coefficient = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π)`\nThe output of the script was `0.506730351619884`.\n\nTherefore, the angular distance is:\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a (This is approximately `θ₁ = z₁/(2π) * (λ/a)`)\nB) 1.220 λ /a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067 * (λ / a)` is best approximated by `0.506 * (λ / a)`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
