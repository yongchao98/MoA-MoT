    "This is a classic particle physics problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in a relativistic framework.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** We have a single positive pion (π⁺) at rest.\n    *   **Final State:** We have a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν_μ) moving in opposite directions.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the total momentum of the final products must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n        *   `p_μ = p_ν = p` (where p is the magnitude of the momentum)\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n        *   `E_initial = E_final`\n        *   The initial energy is the rest mass energy of the stationary pion: `E_initial = m_π * c²`.\n        *   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino: `E_final = E_μ + E_ν`.\n        *   Therefore: `m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν`\n\n3.  **Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   The total energy `E` of a particle is related to its rest mass `m` and momentum `p` by the equation: `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\n\n    *   **For the muon (μ⁺):**\n        *   `E_μ² = (p_μ*c)² + (m_μ*c²)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²`\n\n    *   **For the neutrino (ν_μ):**\n        *   Neutrinos are considered massless (or have negligible mass) in this context. So, we set `m_ν = 0`.\n        *   `E_ν² = (p_ν*c)² + (0)²` => `E_ν = p_ν*c = p*c`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Energies:**\n    *   We have a system of equations. Let's use the given mass values in units of MeV (effectively setting c=1 for calculation, which is common practice in particle physics).\n        *   (1) `139.6 = E_μ + E_ν`\n        *   (2) `E_μ² = p² + (105.7)²`\n        *   (3) `E_ν = p`\n\n    *   From (1), we can express `E_ν` as `E_ν = 139.6 - E_μ`.\n    *   Since `E_ν = p`, we have `p = 139.6 - E_μ`.\n\n    *   Now substitute this expression for `p` into equation (2):\n        *   `E_μ² = (139.6 - E_μ)² + (105.7)²`\n\n    *   Expand the squared term:\n        *   `E_μ² = (139.6² - 2 * 139.6 * E_μ + E_μ²) + 105.7²`\n\n    *   Cancel `E_μ²` from both sides:\n        *   `0 = 139.6² - 279.2 * E_μ + 105.7²`\n\n    *   Rearrange to solve for `E_μ`:\n        *   `279.2 * E_μ = 139.6² + 105.7²`\n        *   `E_μ = (139.6² + 105.7²) / 279.2`\n\n5.  **Calculate Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n    *   Kinetic energy is defined as `KE = E - m*c²` (Total Energy - Rest Mass Energy).\n    *   Once we find `E_μ`, we can find `KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ`.\n    *   We can also find `E_ν` using `E_ν = 139.6 - E_μ`.\n    *   Since the neutrino is massless, its entire energy is kinetic energy: `KE_ν = E_ν`.\n\nThis algebraic calculation can be performed efficiently and accurately using a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Rest masses in MeV/c^2 (we can treat them as energy in MeV for calculations)\nm_pi = 139.6\nm_mu = 105.7\n# m_nu is assumed to be 0\n\n# The decay is Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n# From conservation of energy and momentum, we derived the total energy of the muon:\n# E_mu = (m_pi^2 + m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)\nE_mu = (m_pi**2 + m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy.\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\n# The total energy of the neutrino is found by conservation of energy.\n# E_pi = E_mu + E_nu\nE_nu = m_pi - E_mu\n\n# For a massless neutrino, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places, matching the options.\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n\nBased on the calculation, the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately 29.8 MeV (when rounding 29.78).

    "The problem involves the two-body decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν_μ). We can solve this using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in special relativity.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   Particle: Pion (π⁺)\n*   Status: At rest\n*   Total Initial Energy (E_initial): Rest mass energy of the pion, E_initial = m_π * c²\n*   Total Initial Momentum (p_initial): 0\n\n**2. Final State:**\n*   Particles: Muon (μ⁺) and Neutrino (ν_μ)\n*   Status: Moving\n*   Total Final Energy (E_final): E_μ + E_ν (where E_μ and E_ν are the total energies of the muon and neutrino, respectively)\n*   Total Final Momentum (p_final): **p_μ** + **p_ν** (vector sum)\n\n**3. Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    `p_initial = p_final`\n    `0 = **p_μ** + **p_ν**`\n    This implies that the muon and the neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    Let `p` be the magnitude of the momentum for both particles: `p = |**p_μ**| = |**p_ν**|`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν`\n\n**4. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is given by `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\n\n*   For the muon (μ⁺): `E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²`\n*   For the neutrino (ν_μ): Neutrinos are considered to have zero (or negligible) rest mass. So, `m_ν ≈ 0`.\n    `E_ν² = (p*c)² + (0)²` => `E_ν = p*c`\n\n**5. Solving for the Energies:**\nWe will use units of MeV, where `c=1`. So the equations become:\n1.  `m_π = E_μ + E_ν`\n2.  `E_μ² = p² + m_μ²`\n3.  `E_ν = p`\n\nFrom (1), we have `E_ν = m_π - E_μ`.\nSubstitute this into (3): `p = m_π - E_μ`.\nNow substitute this expression for `p` into (2):\n`E_μ² = (m_π - E_μ)² + m_μ²`\n`E_μ² = m_π² - 2*m_π*E_μ + E_μ² + m_μ²`\n\nCancel `E_μ²` from both sides:\n`0 = m_π² - 2*m_π*E_μ + m_μ²`\n\nRearrange to solve for the total energy of the muon (`E_μ`):\n`2*m_π*E_μ = m_π² + m_μ²`\n`E_μ = (m_π² + m_μ²) / (2*m_π)`\n\n**6. Calculation:**\nGiven:\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (`m_π`) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (`m_μ`) = 105.7 MeV\n\n*   **Total Energy of the Muon (E_μ):**\n    `E_μ = (139.6² + 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6)`\n    `E_μ = (19488.16 + 11172.49) / 279.2`\n    `E_μ = 30660.65 / 279.2`\n    `E_μ ≈ 109.82 MeV`\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n    Kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy (`KE = E - m*c²`).\n    `KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ`\n    `KE_μ = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV`\n    `KE_μ = 4.12 MeV`\n\n*   **Total Energy of the Neutrino (E_ν):**\n    From the conservation of energy (`m_π = E_μ + E_ν`):\n    `E_ν = m_π - E_μ`\n    `E_ν = 139.6 MeV - 109.82 MeV`\n    `E_ν = 29.78 MeV`\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    Since the neutrino is treated as massless, its rest mass energy is zero. Therefore, its entire energy is kinetic energy.\n    `KE_ν = E_ν`\n    `KE_ν = 29.78 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are **4.12 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
