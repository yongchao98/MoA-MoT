    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both unknown compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integral ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integral ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Analyze the structure and expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, 5) are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** corresponding to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 singlets in total (one for 2H Ar, one for 12H Me).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 4 and 6) are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        These will produce **three singlets** with an integral ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 4 singlets in total (one for 2H Ar, three for Me with a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        These will produce **two singlets** with an integral ratio of 6:6, which simplifies to 1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 3 singlets in total (one for 2H Ar, two for Me with a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent and will produce **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Ethyl Protons:** The problem states that the signals in the aliphatic region are all singlets. An ethyl group produces a quartet (for the CH2) and a triplet (for the CH3) due to spin-spin coupling. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This also eliminates option C.\n\n**3. Analyze the spectra of the proposed mixtures (in a 1:1 ratio).**\n\nWe are looking for a combination that gives:\n*   Aromatic: 2 singlets (ratio 1:1)\n*   Aliphatic: 3 singlets (ratio 2:1:1)\n\nSince all three remaining tetramethylbenzene isomers have one singlet for their 2 aromatic protons, any 1:1 mixture of two different isomers will produce two aromatic singlets, each integrating to 2H, giving the required 1:1 ratio. The deciding factor will be the signals from the methyl groups.\n\n*   **Mixture A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: One singlet (12H)\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: Two singlets (6H each)\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This mixture will show three singlets in the aliphatic region with integrals corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   **Integral Ratio:** 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This mixture perfectly matches the provided data.\n\n*   **Mixture B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: Two singlets (6H each)\n        *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This mixture would show up to five signals. Even with accidental overlap of the 6H signals, the ratio would be (6+6+6):3:3 or 18:3:3, which simplifies to 6:1:1. This does not match.\n\n*   **Mixture D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: One singlet (12H)\n        *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This mixture will show four singlets in the aliphatic region.\n    *   **Integral Ratio:** 12:6:3:3, which simplifies to 4:2:1:1. This does not match.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only combination that matches the experimental data (two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio) is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
