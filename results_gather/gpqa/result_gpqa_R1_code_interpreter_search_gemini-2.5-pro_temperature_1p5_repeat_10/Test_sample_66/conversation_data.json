    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of finding the two-electron system in a specific uncoupled state, given that it is initially in a specific coupled state.\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:** The system is in the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ (electron 1 is in a p orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$ (electron 2 is in a p orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$ (the total orbital angular momentum quantum number).\n    *   $m = -1$ (the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number).\n\n2.  **Identify the measurement and the final state:** A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. We want to find the probability of obtaining the eigenvalues:\n    *   For $L_{1z}$: $m_1\\hbar = -\\hbar \\implies m_1 = -1$.\n    *   For $L_{2z}$: $m_2\\hbar = -\\hbar \\implies m_2 = -1$.\n    This corresponds to projecting the initial state onto the final uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1>|l_2, m_2> = |1, -1>|1, -1>$. This is often written in the uncoupled basis as $|l_1, l_2, m_1, m_2> = |1, 1, -1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of the z-component of Angular Momentum:** The total z-component of the angular momentum operator is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with a total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$. This means any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum will yield the value $-1\\hbar$.\n    *   The desired final state after measurement, $|1, -1>|1, -1>$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$. Its total magnetic quantum number is $m' = m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$. A measurement of the total z-component for this state would yield $-2\\hbar$.\n\n    Since the operators for the individual components ($L_{1z}$, $L_{2z}$) commute with the total z-component operator ($L_z$), the total z-component of angular momentum is conserved during the measurement process. The initial state has $m = -1$, while the final state has $m' = -2$. Because $m \\neq m'$, it is impossible to transition from the initial state to this final state. Therefore, the probability must be zero.\n\n4.  **Formal Calculation using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** The probability is the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the final state:\n    $P = | < \\text{final state} | \\text{initial state} > |^2 = | <1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> |^2$\n\n    To calculate this, we express the initial coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ as a linear combination of uncoupled states $|1, 1, m_1, m_2>$ using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:\n    $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} <l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m> |l_1, l_2, m_1, m_2>$\n\n    For our state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, the sum is over $m_1$ and $m_2$ such that $m_1 + m_2 = m = -1$. The possible values for $m_1, m_2$ are $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. The pairs $(m_1, m_2)$ that satisfy the condition are $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$.\n    The expansion is:\n    $|1, 1, 2, -1> = <1, -1, 1, 0 | 2, -1> |1, 1, -1, 0> + <1, 0, 1, -1 | 2, -1> |1, 1, 0, -1>$\n\n    Looking up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling $1 \\otimes 1$ to get $l=2, m=-1$, we find:\n    *   $<1, -1, 1, 0 | 2, -1> = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n    *   $<1, 0, 1, -1 | 2, -1> = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n    So, the state is:\n    $|1, 1, 2, -1> = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |1, 1, -1, 0> + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |1, 1, 0, -1>$\n\n    The state $|1, 1, -1, -1>$ that we are looking for is not present in this expansion. Its coefficient is 0.\n    The probability is the square of the coefficient of the state $|1, 1, -1, -1>$ in the expansion of $|1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    $P = |<1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2 = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
