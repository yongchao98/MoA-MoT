    "This problem requires analyzing the products of an olefin metathesis reaction with a chiral starting material.\n\n1.  **Identify the reactant and the reaction:**\n    *   The reactant is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Its structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.\n    *   The carbon atom at position 3 (C3) is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a methyl group (-CH3), an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), and a vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n    *   The term \"racemic\" means the starting material is a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n    *   The catalyst is Grubbs catalyst, which facilitates olefin metathesis. For a single terminal alkene reactant (self-metathesis), the general reaction is:\n        2 R-CH=CH2  ->  R-CH=CH-R + CH2=CH2 (ethene)\n    *   The question asks for the number of possible products excluding ethene. So we are interested in the R-CH=CH-R products. In our case, the R group is the chiral sec-butyl group, -CH(CH3)CH2CH3. The product will be 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the possible reaction combinations:**\n    Since the starting material is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) enantiomers, there are three possible pairings in the self-metathesis reaction:\n    *   Reaction of two (R) molecules: (R) + (R)\n    *   Reaction of two (S) molecules: (S) + (S)\n    *   Reaction between an (R) and an (S) molecule: (R) + (S)\n\n3.  **Analyze the products from each combination:**\n    The product molecule, 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene, has two chiral centers (C3 and C6) and a new double bond (C4=C5), which can have either E (trans) or Z (cis) geometry. We need to analyze the stereochemistry of the products from each reaction pathway.\n\n    *   **(R) + (R) reaction:**\n        (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene + (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene -> (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n        This product has two chiral centers with the same configuration. It is chiral (it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n        The new double bond can be E or Z, leading to two different products which are diastereomers:\n        1.  (E)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n        2.  (Z)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n\n    *   **(S) + (S) reaction:**\n        (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene + (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene -> (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n        This product is also chiral. The products are the enantiomers of those formed in the (R) + (R) reaction. Since enantiomers are distinct compounds, we get two more products:\n        3.  (E)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral, enantiomer of product 1)\n        4.  (Z)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral, enantiomer of product 2)\n\n    *   **(R) + (S) reaction (cross-metathesis):**\n        (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene + (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene -> (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n        This product has two chiral centers with opposite configurations. We need to check if these molecules are meso (achiral despite having chiral centers).\n        - Let's analyze the Z-isomer: (Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. In this molecule, the two sec-butyl groups are on the same side of the double bond. It possesses an internal plane of symmetry that bisects the C=C double bond. The (R) half is a mirror image of the (S) half. Therefore, this is a meso compound.\n          5.  (Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso, achiral)\n        - Let's analyze the E-isomer: (E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. In this molecule, the two sec-butyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. It does not have a plane of symmetry, but it has a center of inversion (i) at the midpoint of the C=C bond. Inversion of the (R) center at C3 through this point maps onto the (S) center at C6. Molecules with a center of inversion are achiral. Therefore, this is also a meso compound.\n          6.  (E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso, achiral)\n        These two meso compounds are diastereomers of each other and of the four chiral products listed above.\n\n4.  **Count the total number of products:**\n    Summing up all the distinct products formed:\n    *   2 chiral products from the (R)+(R) reaction.\n    *   2 chiral products from the (S)+(S) reaction (these are the enantiomers of the first two).\n    *   2 achiral (meso) products from the (R)+(S) reaction.\n\n    The total number of possible products is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<D>>>"
