    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data (Mass Spectrometry, IR Spectroscopy, and ¹H NMR) to deduce the structure of an unknown compound from a given list of options.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes of its constituent atoms.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of 100:32 (approximately 3:1) is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom. (Naturally occurring chlorine is a mixture of two isotopes: ³⁵Cl (~75% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (~25% abundance)).\n\nLet's verify the molecular formula and weight for the candidates. All four options (Phenyl chloroformate, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) have the same chemical formula: **C₇H₅ClO₂**.\n\nThe molecular weight calculation (using the most common isotopes, C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35) is:\n(7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = **156 g/mol**.\n\nThis matches the M+ peak. The presence of the ³⁷Cl isotope would give a molecular weight of 158, matching the M+2 peak. Therefore, the mass spectrometry data is consistent with all four options, confirming the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is a result of extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Specifically, its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\nThe combination of these two peaks is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** An acid chloride. Would lack the broad O-H stretch. Eliminated.\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** A carboxylic acid. Consistent with IR data.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** A carboxylic acid. Consistent with IR data.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** A phenol (-OH) and an aldehyde (-CHO). A phenolic O-H is typically less broad (e.g., 3500-3200 cm⁻¹), and an aldehyde lacks the specific broadness down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This option is unlikely. Eliminated.\n\nBased on the IR data, the compound is either 2-chlorobenzoic acid or 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum provides information about the different types of protons and their neighboring environment.\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). It is a singlet (s) because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with, and it integrates to one proton (1H). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The signals at **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** correspond to the protons on the benzene ring.\n    *   The key information here is the pattern: two doublets, each integrating to two protons.\n    *   This simple, symmetrical pattern arises from a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The two protons adjacent to one substituent are equivalent to each other, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options based on this pattern:\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted ring. It has no plane of symmetry, meaning all four aromatic protons are chemically unique. This would lead to a more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets of 2H each.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted ring. It possesses the exact symmetry required to produce two doublets for the four aromatic protons. The protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons adjacent to the chlorine atom appear slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm). This structure perfectly matches the NMR data.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy synthesizing the information from all three spectroscopic techniques:\n1.  **MS** confirms the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n2.  **IR** identifies the compound as a carboxylic acid.\n3.  **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and reveals the substitution pattern on the aromatic ring to be para (1,4-).\n\nThe only structure that fits all the evidence is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
