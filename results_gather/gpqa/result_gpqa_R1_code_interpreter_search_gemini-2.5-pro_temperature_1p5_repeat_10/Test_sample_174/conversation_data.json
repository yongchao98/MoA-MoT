    "An oscillating spheroid charge distribution with a symmetry axis along the z-axis can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The electric dipole moment vector, **p**, oscillates along the z-axis. The physics of radiation from such a dipole is a standard topic in classical electromagnetism.\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n\n`dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `K` is a constant that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment, the frequency of oscillation, and physical constants.\n*   `θ` is the angle between the direction of observation and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\n\nThe question states that the maximum radiated power is `A`. The maximum value of the function `sin²(θ)` occurs when `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis), because `sin(90°) = 1`.\n\nSo, the maximum power per unit solid angle is:\n`A = (dP/dΩ)_max = K * sin²(90°) = K * (1)² = K`\n\nWe are asked to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. Let's calculate the power at this angle:\n\n`(dP/dΩ) at θ=30° = K * sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`. Therefore:\n`(dP/dΩ) at θ=30° = K * (1/2)² = K / 4`\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power `A` is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the maximum power:\n`Fraction = [(dP/dΩ) at θ=30°] / A = (K/4) / K = 1/4`\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe function `f(λ, θ)` represents the radiated power per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`. The constant `K` in the formula above is not just a number; it contains the dependence on the frequency (and thus wavelength) of the oscillation. The full formula for `dP/dΩ` is:\n\n`dP/dΩ = (μ₀ * p₀² * ω⁴) / (32 * π² * c) * sin²(θ)`\n\nHere, `ω` is the angular frequency of the oscillation. The relationship between angular frequency `ω`, the speed of light `c`, and the wavelength `λ` is:\n\n`ω = 2π * (frequency) = 2π * (c/λ)`\n\nFrom the formula for `dP/dΩ`, we can see that the radiated power is proportional to `ω⁴`:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\nSubstituting the expression for `ω` in terms of `λ`:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis strong dependence on wavelength is characteristic of dipole radiation and is famously responsible for Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue (shorter wavelengths like blue and violet are scattered much more strongly than longer wavelengths like red).\n\nTherefore, a possible form for the function `f` is one that is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the two results:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The radiated power is proportional to **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
