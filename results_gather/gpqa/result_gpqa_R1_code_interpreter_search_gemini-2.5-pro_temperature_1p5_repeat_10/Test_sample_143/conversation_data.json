    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance ($L$) of a meson resonance X.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula:** The mean decay distance of a moving particle is given by the formula:\n    $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$\n    where:\n    *   $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $\\beta = v/c$ is the particle's velocity as a fraction of the speed of light.\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   $\\tau$ is the proper lifetime of the particle (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n\n3.  **Break Down the Formula into Computable Parts:**\n    *   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The proper lifetime is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   **Relativistic factor ($\\gamma \\beta$):** The term $\\gamma \\beta c$ represents the product of the Lorentz factor, velocity, and the speed of light. In high-energy physics, it's often more convenient to express this in terms of energy and mass.\n        The total energy is $E = \\gamma m c^2$.\n        The relativistic momentum is $p = \\gamma \\beta m c$.\n        From these, we can derive that $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{p c}{m c^2} = \\frac{p}{m}$ (in units where c=1).\n        The relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n        Solving for momentum $p$: $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$.\n        Therefore, $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$.\n\n4.  **Combine the Formulas:** Substituting the expressions for $\\tau$ and $\\gamma \\beta$ back into the main formula for $L$:\n    $L = (\\gamma \\beta) \\cdot (c \\tau) = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}\\right)$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2}}{m_X} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    This formula is ideal because we are given all the values in units of energy (GeV and MeV), and the physical constant $\\hbar c$ has a well-known value in MeV·fm.\n\n5.  **List the Given Values and Constants:**\n    *   Energy $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Mass $m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Width $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   The constant $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV·fm}$ (where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m).\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** Now, we substitute the numerical values into the derived formula.

    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance ($L$) of the meson resonance X. This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Concepts and Formulas:**\n    *   **Mean Decay Distance:** The mean decay distance of a relativistic particle is given by $L = v \\cdot t_{lab}$, where $v$ is its velocity and $t_{lab}$ is its mean lifetime in the laboratory frame.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime in the lab frame ($t_{lab}$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau$, the lifetime in its own rest frame) due to time dilation: $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$, where $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Putting it together:** The formula for the mean decay distance becomes $L = v \\gamma \\tau$. It's often written as $L = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   **Lifetime and Decay Width:** The proper lifetime ($\\tau$) of a particle is related to its decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The Lorentz factor term, $\\beta \\gamma$, can be expressed in terms of the particle's total energy ($E$) and rest mass ($m$). The total energy is $E = \\gamma m c^2$, and the momentum is $p = \\gamma \\beta m c$. The fundamental relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. From these, we can derive the useful expression:\n        $\\beta \\gamma = \\frac{p c}{m c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:**\n    By substituting the expressions for $\\tau$ and $\\beta\\gamma$ into the decay distance formula, we get:\n    $L = (\\beta \\gamma) \\cdot (c \\tau) = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2} \\right) \\cdot \\left( c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} \\right)$\n    This can be rearranged into a more convenient form for calculation:\n    $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2 c^4}}{m_X c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    In particle physics, it's common to work in units where $c=1$, so mass and energy have the same units (e.g., MeV). The formula simplifies to:\n    $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2}}{m_X} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n4.  **Gather the Given Values and Constants:**\n    *   Total energy $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Rest mass $m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Decay width $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Physical constant $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV·fm}$ (where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m)\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    To ensure accuracy, we can use a short Python script to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given values and constants\nE_X = 8000.0      # Energy in MeV\nm_X = 1200.0      # Mass in MeV\nGamma_X = 320.0   # Width in MeV\nhbar_c = 197.327  # h-bar * c in MeV*fm\n\n# Calculate the relativistic factor term (beta*gamma)\n# This term is dimensionless\nbeta_gamma = math.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X**2) / m_X\n\n# Calculate the mean proper decay length (c*tau)\nc_tau = hbar_c / Gamma_X # in fm\n\n# Calculate the mean decay distance L in femtometers (fm)\nL_fm = beta_gamma * c_tau\n\n# Convert the final result to meters (1 fm = 1e-15 m)\nL_meters = L_fm * 1e-15\n\nprint(f\"{L_meters:.4e}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n4.0645e-15\n</execute_code>\n6.  **Interpret the Result and Compare with Options:**\n    The calculation yields a mean decay distance of approximately $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n\n    Now, let's compare this with the provided choices:\n    A) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n    B) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n    C) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n    D) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n\n    Our calculated value, $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m, is extremely close to option A. The minor difference (about 0.02%) is likely due to slight variations in the precision of the physical constant $\\hbar c$ used to formulate the question. The other options are incorrect either by the leading digit or by an order of magnitude.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculation steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The problem asks for the mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall the relevant physics principles:**\n    *   The mean lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, $\\tau$) is related to its decay width ($\\Gamma$) through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   Due to relativistic time dilation, a particle moving with a Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ has a longer mean lifetime in the lab frame: $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$.\n    *   The distance traveled in the lab frame is the velocity ($v$) multiplied by the lab lifetime: $L = v \\cdot t_{lab} = v \\gamma \\tau$.\n    *   It is convenient to use the dimensionless velocity $\\beta = v/c$, so the formula becomes $L = \\beta c \\gamma \\tau$.\n\n3.  **Formulate a practical calculation strategy:**\n    *   The term $\\beta\\gamma$ can be expressed using the particle's total energy ($E$) and rest mass ($m$). The relationship is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$ and $pc = \\beta \\gamma mc^2$. Combining these gives $\\beta \\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$.\n    *   Substituting the expressions for $\\tau$ and $\\beta\\gamma$ into the decay distance formula:\n        $L = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2} \\right) \\cdot c \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} \\right)$\n    *   Rearranging for easier calculation with particle physics units (where mass and energy are often given in MeV or GeV), we use the combined constant $\\hbar c$:\n        $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2}}{m_X} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n        (This is assuming we work in units where c=1, so E, m, and $\\Gamma$ are all in energy units).\n\n4.  **Gather the numerical values:**\n    *   Production Energy $E_{X}=8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Mass $m_{X}=1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Width $\\Gamma_{X}=320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Physical constant $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV·fm}$ (note: 1 femtometer = $10^{-15}$ meters).\n\n5.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    *   The term $\\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2}}{m_X} = \\frac{\\sqrt{8000^2 - 1200^2}}{1200} \\approx 6.591$\n    *   The term $\\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV·fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 0.6166 \\text{ fm}$\n    *   $L \\approx 6.591 \\times 0.6166 \\text{ fm} \\approx 4.0645 \\text{ fm}$\n\n6.  **Convert to meters and compare with options:**\n    *   The result is $L \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n    *   This value matches option A ($4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m) very closely. The small difference (about 0.02%) is due to the specific precision used for the physical constant $\\hbar c$ when the question was authored. The other options are incorrect by a significant margin.\n\nThe previous code execution confirmed this calculation, yielding `4.0645e-15`. This result strongly supports option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
