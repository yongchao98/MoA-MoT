    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to determine the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). The question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is the ratio M1 / M2.\n\n2.  **Gather the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial velocity amplitude of star A (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial velocity amplitude of star B (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial velocity amplitude of star A (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial velocity amplitude of star B (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Identify the Relevant Physics Principle:** The total mass (M = m1 + m2) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is related to its orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K1, K2) by the following formula, which is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n\n    M = (P / (2 * π * G)) * ((K1 + K2)^3 / sin³(i))\n\n    Where:\n    *   M is the total mass of the system.\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n4.  **Incorporate a Key Observation:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. For eclipses to occur, the orbital plane must be very close to our line of sight. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. For `i = 90°`, `sin(i) = 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) = 1`. This simplifies the mass formula significantly.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Simplified Mass Equation:** Assuming `sin(i) = 1`, the mass of a system is given by:\n\n    M = (P / (2 * π * G)) * (K1 + K2)³\n\n    This shows that the total mass M is directly proportional to the period P and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes.\n\n    M ∝ P * (K_total)³ where K_total = K1 + K2.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Velocity Amplitudes:**\n    *   For System 1: K_total_1 = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s.\n    *   For System 2: K_total_2 = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s.\n\n7.  **Set Up the Mass Ratio:** We need to find the ratio M1 / M2. Using the proportionality from step 5:\n\n    M1 / M2 = (P1 * (K_total_1)³) / (P2 * (K_total_2)³)\n\n    The constant terms (like 2, π, and G) cancel out when taking the ratio.\n\n8.  **Substitute the Values and Calculate:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K_total_1 = 15 km/s\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K_total_2 = 25 km/s\n\n    M1 / M2 = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³)\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n\n9.  **Convert to a Decimal and Compare with Options:**\n    *   M1 / M2 = 54 / 125 = 0.432\n\n    This value is approximately 0.4. Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) ~ 1.2\n    B) ~ 0.7\n    C) ~ 0.6\n    D) ~ 0.4\n\n    The calculated value of 0.432 is closest to option D.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's use a code interpreter for the final calculation.\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_tot = 10 + 5  # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2_tot = 15 + 10  # km/s\n\n# The total mass M is proportional to P * (K_tot)^3\n# We need to find the ratio M1 / M2\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the ratio (proportional to M1)\nM1_proportional = P1 * (K1_tot)**3\n\n# Calculate the denominator for the ratio (proportional to M2)\nM2_proportional = P2 * (K2_tot)**3\n\n# Calculate the final ratio\nratio = M1_proportional / M2_proportional\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation confirms that the ratio is 0.432, which is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>",
