    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial Conditions\n-   An atomic nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n-   Its rest mass is M, and its rest-mass energy is `M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Understand the Final State after Fission\n-   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n-   The fragment `m1` is more massive: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n-   The sum of the fragment rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Rest Masses and Energies of the Fragments\nFirst, we find the individual masses `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`.\n-   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation:\n    `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n-   Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we calculate their rest-mass energies:\n-   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * M * c^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n-   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * M * c^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation Laws\n\n#### Conservation of Energy\nThe total energy before and after the fission must be the same.\n-   Initial energy: `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`\n-   Final energy: `E_final = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`, where T1 and T2 are the kinetic energies of the fragments.\n\n`E_initial = E_final`\n`300 GeV = (198 GeV + T1) + (99 GeV + T2)`\n`300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1 + T2`\n\nThe total kinetic energy released is:\n`Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n#### Conservation of Momentum\nThe initial momentum is zero. The final momentum must also be zero.\n-   `p_initial = 0`\n-   `p_final = p1 + p2 = 0`\nThis implies that the fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n### 5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. We can express `(p*c)^2` in terms of kinetic energy `T` as `(p*c)^2 = T * (T + 2*m*c^2)`.\n\nSince the momenta `p1` and `p2` are equal in magnitude:\n`(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`\n`T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2)`\n\nSubstitute `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`:\n`T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)`\n`T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1_rel = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\nConverting to MeV: `T1_rel = 1.005 * 1000 MeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 6. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSince the momenta are equal:\n`p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_cla`\n`p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_cla`\n\n`2 * m1 * T1_cla = 2 * m2 * T2_cla`\n`m1 * T1_cla = m2 * T2_cla`\n`T1_cla / T2_cla = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_cla = 2 * T1_cla`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `T1_cla + T2_cla = 3 GeV`:\n`T1_cla + 2*T1_cla = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_cla = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cla = 1 GeV`\n\nConverting to MeV: `T1_cla = 1 * 1000 MeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 7. Find the Difference\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1_rel - T1_cla`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n```python\n# Constants and given values\nMc2 = 300.0  # GeV\n\n# Rest mass energies of the fragments in GeV\n# m1 = 0.66 * M, m2 = 0.33 * M\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\n\n# Total kinetic energy released (Q-value) in GeV\n# Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# Relativistic Calculation for T1\n# Solves 2*Mc2 * T1 = Q * (Q + 2*m2c2) for T1\nT1_rel_GeV = (Q * (Q + 2 * m2c2)) / (2 * Mc2)\n\n# Classical Calculation for T1\n# Solves T1 + T2 = Q and T1/T2 = m2/m1\nT1_cla_GeV = Q / 3.0\n\n# Difference in MeV\ndifference_MeV = (T1_rel_GeV - T1_cla_GeV) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"{difference_MeV}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n5.0\n</execute_code>\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5 \\text{ MeV}}$.\n<<<D>>>",

    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Define Variables and Extract Given Information\n*   Let `M` be the rest mass of the initial nucleus.\n*   The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n*   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Fragment 1 is the more massive one: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   `T1` is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`).\n*   The goal is to find the difference: `ΔT1 = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest Masses and Energies of the Fragments\nWe have a system of two equations to find `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute equation (1) into (2):\n`(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate their rest-mass energies using the initial energy `M * c^2 = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws\n**Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before equals the total energy after. The energy released as kinetic energy is called the Q-value.\n`E_initial = E_final`\n`M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n`300 GeV = (198 GeV + T1) + (99 GeV + T2)`\n`300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1 + T2`\n\nThe total kinetic energy of the fragments is:\n`Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe initial momentum was zero, so the final total momentum must also be zero.\n`P_initial = P_final = 0`\n`p1 + p2 = 0`\nThis means the fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n### 4. Calculate `T1` using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSince the momentum magnitudes are equal:\n`p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_cla`\n`p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_cla`\n\nTherefore, `2 * m1 * T1_cla = 2 * m2 * T2_cla`, which simplifies to `m1 * T1_cla = m2 * T2_cla`.\nThe ratio of kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of masses:\n`T1_cla / T2_cla = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\nSo, `T2_cla = 2 * T1_cla`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q = T1_cla + T2_cla = 3 GeV`:\n`T1_cla + 2*T1_cla = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_cla = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cla = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 5. Calculate `T1` using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. We can express `(p*c)^2` as:\n`(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\nSince the momentum magnitudes are equal, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n\nFrom total energy conservation, the sum of the total energies of the fragments equals the initial energy:\n`E1 + E2 = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\nUsing the difference of squares factorization `a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)` on the momentum equation:\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\nSubstitute the known values:\n`(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV)^2 - (99 GeV)^2`\n`(E1 - E2) * 300 = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n`E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`.\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations for `E1` and `E2`:\n1. `E1 + E2 = 300`\n2. `E1 - E2 = 98.01`\n\nAdd the two equations to solve for `E1`:\n`2*E1 = 300 + 98.01 = 398.01`\n`E1 = 398.01 / 2 = 199.005 GeV`.\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1_rel = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n`T1_rel = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\nFinally, calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for `T1`.\n`ΔT1 = T1_rel - T1_cla = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nTo ensure perfect precision and avoid floating-point errors, we can use a Python script with the `Fraction` module.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# All energies in GeV\n# Initial rest-mass energy\nE_initial = Fraction(300)\n\n# Calculate fragment rest-mass energies\nm1c2 = Fraction(66, 100) * E_initial\nm2c2 = Fraction(33, 100) * E_initial\n\n# Calculate total kinetic energy (Q-value)\nQ = E_initial - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# --- Classical Calculation for T1 ---\n# From m1*T1 = m2*T2 and T1+T2=Q, we get T1_cla = Q * (m2 / (m1+m2))\n# m2/(m1+m2) = (0.33*M)/(0.99*M) = 1/3\nT1_classical_GeV = Q / 3\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation for T1 ---\n# From (E1-E2)(E1+E2) = (m1c2)^2 - (m2c2)^2 and E1+E2 = E_initial,\n# we find E1 = (E_initial^2 + m1c2^2 - m2c2^2) / (2 * E_initial)\nE1_GeV = (E_initial**2 + m1c2**2 - m2c2**2) / (2 * E_initial)\nT1_relativistic_GeV = E1_GeV - m1c2\n\n# --- Difference ---\n# The difference in GeV\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic_GeV - T1_classical_GeV\n# Convert to MeV for the final answer\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\n# Print the final result as a floating-point number\nprint(float(difference_MeV))\n```\n<execute_code>\n5.0\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the exact difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Given Information\n*   The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of `M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   It is at rest, so its initial momentum is 0.\n\n### 2. Final State after Fission\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   The relationship between the masses is `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\nFirst, we solve for the individual masses in terms of `M`.\n*   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation:\n    `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n*   Then, find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Applying Conservation Laws\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial rest energy is converted into the rest energy and kinetic energy of the fragments. The difference in rest energy is released as kinetic energy, `Q`.\n    `Q = T1 + T2 = (M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    So, the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. This means the two fragments fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction.\n    `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n### 5. Calculating T1 with the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`. Since the momenta `p` are equal for both fragments:\n`p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_cla`\n`p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_cla`\nTherefore, `m1 * T1_cla = m2 * T2_cla`.\nThe kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses:\n`T1_cla / T2_cla = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\nThis gives us `T2_cla = 2 * T1_cla`.\n\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_cla + T2_cla = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cla + 2*T1_cla = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_cla = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cla = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 6. Calculating T1 with the Correct Relativistic Formula\nThe relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nSince `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\nWhere `E1` and `E2` are the *total* energies of the fragments (`E = T + m*c^2`).\n\nBy conservation of energy, the sum of the total energies is the initial energy of the nucleus:\n`E1 + E2 = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\nUsing the difference of squares `(a^2 - b^2) = (a - b)(a + b)` on the momentum equation:\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV)^2 - (99 GeV)^2`\n`(E1 - E2) * 300 = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n`E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a simple system of two equations:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01`\n\nAdding the two equations yields:\n`2*E1 = 398.01`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy minus the rest energy:\n`T1_rel = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n`T1_rel = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 7. Finding the Difference\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1_rel - T1_cla`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
