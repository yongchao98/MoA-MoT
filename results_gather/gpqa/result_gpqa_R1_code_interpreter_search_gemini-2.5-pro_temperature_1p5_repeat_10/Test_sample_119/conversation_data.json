    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the setup:**\n    *   **Uniform distribution of stars:** This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere in space.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The relationship is given by `plx = 1/d`. From this, we can also write `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Count stars in a thin shell of space:**\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer (Earth). Let the inner radius of the shell be `d` and the outer radius be `d + Δd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`ΔV`) can be approximated by its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n        `ΔV ≈ (Surface Area of sphere with radius d) × (thickness)`\n        `ΔV ≈ 4πd² * Δd`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in this shell:**\n    *   Since the stars are uniformly distributed with a density `ρ`, the number of stars (`ΔN`) in this volume `ΔV` is:\n        `ΔN = ρ * ΔV`\n        `ΔN = ρ * 4πd² * Δd`\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax (plx):**\n    *   The goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`ΔN/Δplx`) depends on `plx`. To do this, we need to substitute `d` and `Δd` with expressions involving `plx` and `Δplx`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between `Δd` and `Δplx`, we can use calculus. Taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   For small intervals, we can approximate `Δd` as:\n        `Δd ≈ |dd/d(plx)| * Δplx = (1/plx²) * Δplx`\n        (We take the absolute value because we are interested in the number of stars within a positive interval of distance or parallax, so the count must be positive).\n\n5.  **Substitute and simplify:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `Δd` into our equation for `ΔN`:\n        `ΔN ≈ ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * ( (1/plx²) * Δplx )`\n    *   Combine the terms involving `plx`:\n        `ΔN ≈ ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * Δplx`\n\n6.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `ΔN/Δplx`.\n    *   From the equation above, we can divide by `Δplx`:\n        `ΔN / Δplx ≈ ρ * 4π / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Determine the proportionality:**\n    *   In this final expression, `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are all constants. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the remaining term:\n        `(Number of stars per unit parallax) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Match with the given options:**\n    *   The result `~ 1/plx⁴` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
