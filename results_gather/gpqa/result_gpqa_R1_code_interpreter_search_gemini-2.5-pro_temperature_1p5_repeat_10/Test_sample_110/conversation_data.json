    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a ketone with an alpha-hydrogen, a strong and sterically hindered base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK), and an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate). This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** The base (t-BuOK) will deprotonate the ketone at its alpha-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   **Electrophile:** Ethyl acrylate is the Michael acceptor, an electrophile that gets attacked by the enolate.\n\n3.  **Formation of the enolate:**\n    *   The structure of the ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The carbonyl carbon is C1.\n    *   The alpha-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and one hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon.\n    *   Since C2 has no alpha-hydrogens, the base *must* deprotonate the alpha-hydrogen at C6. The bulky t-BuOK base will form the enolate at the less substituted C6 position, which is the only option here.\n\n       (Conceptual step, image not generated)\n\n4.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate formed at C6 will attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the CH₂ group of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   Subsequent protonation (typically during aqueous workup) of the intermediate enolate formed from the acrylate will yield the final product.\n\n5.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule consists of the original cyclohexanone ring with a `–CH₂–CH₂–COOEt` group attached to C6.\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, the ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone. Therefore, the parent chain is the ester, `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   We need to name this complex substituent. Numbering of the cyclohexyl ring starts at the point of attachment (the original C6 of the ketone) as C1' of the substituent.\n    *   Following the ring numbering to give the lowest locants to other groups:\n        *   C1' (original C6): attachment point, also has a methyl group.\n        *   C2' (original C1): has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   C3' (original C2): has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   The name of the substituent is therefore `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Combining everything, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a nitroalkane, a base (KOH), and an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. This is a nitro-Michael addition.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** The hydrogens on the carbon alpha to the nitro group (C1 of 1-nitropropane) are acidic. The base (KOH) deprotonates this carbon to form a carbanion (a nitronate anion), which is the nucleophile.\n    *   **Electrophile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃–CH=CH–CN), also known as crotononitrile, is the Michael acceptor.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The carbanion from 1-nitropropane, `[CH₃–CH₂–CH–NO₂]⁻`, attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. In CH₃(C4)–CH(C3,β)=CH(C2,α)–CN(C1), the β-carbon is C3.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the 1-nitropropane moiety and C3 of the but-2-enenitrile moiety.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water at C2 to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The product structure is formed by linking the two pieces: `(CH₃–CH₂–CH(NO₂))` and `(–CH(CH₃)–CH₂–CN)`.\n    *   The combined structure is: `CH₃–CH₂–CH(NO₂) – CH(CH₃) – CH₂–CN`.\n    *   To name this product, the nitrile group (–CN) is the principal functional group.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is six carbons long. Therefore, the parent name is `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        `C⁶H₃–C⁵H₂–C⁴H(NO₂) – C³H(CH₃) – C²H₂–C¹N`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   In alphabetical order, the name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing this with the given options, the correct choice is A.\n\nA) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\nB) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\nC) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\nD) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n\nThe calculated products for both A and B match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
