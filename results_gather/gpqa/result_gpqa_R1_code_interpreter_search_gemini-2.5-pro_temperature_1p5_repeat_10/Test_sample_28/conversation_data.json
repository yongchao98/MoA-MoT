    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Goal:** The main objective is to find a mutation that inactivates a gene responsible for producing an \"anti-nutritional compound.\" In simple terms, we need to find the mutation that is most likely to break the gene and stop it from making a functional protein.\n\n2.  **Understand the Basics of Gene Expression:**\n    *   A gene's DNA sequence is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA).\n    *   The mRNA is then translated into a protein.\n    *   Translation starts at a specific \"start codon\" (`ATG` in DNA, which becomes `AUG` in mRNA) and reads the sequence in groups of three letters called \"codons.\"\n    *   Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid, which are the building blocks of proteins.\n    *   Translation stops when it hits a \"stop codon\" (`TGA`, `TAA`, or `TAG` in DNA).\n    *   A protein's function depends entirely on its specific sequence of amino acids.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Different Types of Mutations:** To break a gene, we want the most disruptive mutation possible. Let's rank them by how likely they are to cause a total loss of function:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** This changes a regular codon into a STOP codon. This is highly disruptive because it cuts the protein short (truncation). A very short protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** This is caused by inserting or deleting a number of bases that is *not* a multiple of three (e.g., deleting 1 base, or inserting 2 bases). This shifts the entire \"reading frame\" of the codons. All the amino acids downstream from the mutation will be wrong, and usually, a new stop codon is encountered quickly. This is also highly disruptive and likely to be a knockout.\n    *   **In-frame Insertion/Deletion:** This is caused by inserting or deleting a number of bases that *is* a multiple of three (e.g., deleting 3 bases = 1 codon). This adds or removes one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. This *might* inactivate the protein if the changed region is critical, but it's not a guarantee.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** This changes a single codon so that it codes for a *different* amino acid. This might affect protein function, or it might not, depending on how important that specific amino acid was. It's less reliable for inactivation than the mutations above.\n    *   **Silent (or Synonymous) Mutation:** This changes a codon, but the new codon still codes for the *same* amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Mutant Sequence:** The key is to compare each mutant sequence to the intact gene, codon by codon. The first codon is `ATG` (Start/Methionine) in all of them. Let's look at what comes next.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n        *   Codon 1: `ATG` (Methionine)\n        *   Codon 2: `TTT` (Phenylalanine)\n        *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leucine)\n        *   Amino Acid Sequence starts: Met-Phe-Leu...\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...`\n        *   Codon 1: `ATG` (Met)\n        *   Codon 2: `TTC` (Phenylalanine - same as TTT, so this is a silent mutation).\n        *   Codon 3: `TAC` (Tyrosine - different from Leucine).\n        *   **Analysis:** This is a missense mutation. It changes one amino acid (Leu -> Tyr). The protein might still be functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...`\n        *   Codon 1: `ATG` (Met)\n        *   Codon 2: `TTC` (Phe - silent mutation).\n        *   Codon 3: `TAA` (**STOP codon**).\n        *   **Analysis:** This is a nonsense mutation. Translation will stop right here. The \"protein\" produced will only be two amino acids long (Met-Phe). This is definitely not the full, functional protein. This has the highest probability of eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTT...`\n        *   Comparing the full string to the intact one shows it's 3 bases longer, indicating an insertion of a full codon. There's also a base change.\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n        *   Mutant 3 can be aligned as: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...`\n        *   This represents a missense mutation (`CTC` -> `TAC`) and an in-frame insertion of a new codon (`GTC`, coding for Valine).\n        *   **Analysis:** An amino acid is changed, and another is added. The reading frame is not broken. This is disruptive, but less so than a premature stop codon. The protein might still have some function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...`\n        *   Comparing the full string to the intact one shows it's 3 bases shorter, indicating a deletion of a full codon. There's also a base change.\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n        *   Mutant 4 can be aligned as: `ATG TTT TAC GCT --- ACT...`\n        *   This represents a missense mutation (`CTC` -> `TAC`) and an in-frame deletion of one codon (`GGT`, which codes for Glycine).\n        *   **Analysis:** An amino acid is changed, and another is removed. The reading frame is not broken. Similar to Mutant 3, this is disruptive but not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene (the 3rd codon). This will truncate protein synthesis almost immediately, resulting in a tiny, non-functional dipeptide. This is the most reliable way to ensure the gene's product is eliminated. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to solve the farmer's problem. Mutant 2 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
