    "This problem requires calculating the final pH after mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The solution involves a series of neutralization reactions.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 mol of H+.\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates to give two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol OH⁻\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions.**\nFirst, the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2).\n*   Reaction: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n*   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n*   Since there are more moles of OH⁻, the H⁺ will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n*   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH⁻ → CH3COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n*   The weak acid (CH3COOH) is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n*   Excess moles of OH⁻ = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the pH of the final solution.**\nThe final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH⁻, a strong base, which will primarily determine the pH. The contribution from the hydrolysis of the produced acetate (CH3COO⁻) is negligible in the presence of a strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻ ions:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   At 25°C, pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles calculations\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500\nmoles_hcl = 0.2 * 0.400\nmoles_baoh2 = 0.3 * 0.300\n\n# Moles of acidic and basic species\nmoles_h_plus_strong = moles_hcl\nmoles_oh_minus_strong = 2 * moles_baoh2\n\n# Neutralization of strong acid and strong base\nmoles_oh_after_hcl_reaction = moles_oh_minus_strong - moles_h_plus_strong\n\n# Neutralization of remaining strong base with weak acid\nexcess_moles_oh = moles_oh_after_hcl_reaction - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Total volume of the solution in Liters\ntotal_volume_L = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\n\n# Concentration of excess hydroxide ions\nconcentration_oh = excess_moles_oh / total_volume_L\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(concentration_oh)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH=:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<D>>>",
    "The final solution is basic because the moles of hydroxide ions from the strong base exceed the moles of hydrogen ions from both the strong and weak acids.\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species:**\n    *   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n        `Volume × Molarity = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol`\n    *   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):** HCl completely dissociates.\n        `Volume × Molarity = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol H⁺`\n    *   **Total initial moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents):**\n        `Moles from HCl + Moles from CH3COOH = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol`\n    *   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):** Ba(OH)₂ provides two OH⁻ ions per formula unit.\n        `Volume × Molarity × 2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 = 0.180 mol OH⁻`\n\n2.  **Determine the excess reactant after neutralization:**\n    The strong base (OH⁻) will first neutralize the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) and then the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):** 0.180 mol\n    *   **Total moles of acid (H⁺):** 0.130 mol\n    *   Since there are more moles of base than acid, the final solution will be basic.\n    *   **Excess moles of OH⁻:** `Moles OH⁻ - Moles Acid = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol`\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentration of the excess hydroxide ions:**\n    *   **Total volume of the solution:**\n        `500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L`\n    *   **Concentration of OH⁻ ([OH⁻]):**\n        `[OH⁻] = Excess moles of OH⁻ / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M`\n\n4.  **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   **pOH:**\n        `pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38`\n    *   **pH:** The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is `pH + pOH = 14`.\n        `pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62`\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
