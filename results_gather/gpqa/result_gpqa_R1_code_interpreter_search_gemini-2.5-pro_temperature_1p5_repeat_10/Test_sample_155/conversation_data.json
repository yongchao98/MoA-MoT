    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a symmetrical trans-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs an epoxidation on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face. The epoxidation of a trans-alkene produces a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides. For (E)-oct-4-ene, this yields a 50:50 mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺):** This performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule on one of the protonated epoxide carbons. This attack occurs from the side opposite the C-O bond, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl groups relative to each other.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The combination of epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is a method for *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A key principle in stereochemistry is that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound (if the substituents allow for a plane of symmetry, which they do here since the alkene is symmetrical).\n    *   Let's follow the intermediates: The racemic mixture of epoxides ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) reacts with water.\n    *   Attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide at either C4 or C5 leads to inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon, producing the (4S,5R)-diol.\n    *   Attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide at either C4 or C5 produces the (4R,5S)-diol.\n    *   The (4R,5S)-diol and (4S,5R)-diol are the same molecule: meso-octane-4,5-diol, which is an achiral compound with an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a symmetrical cis-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene is the formation of a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's follow the intermediates: The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to the *cis*-alkene forms a *meso*-epoxide ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   Acid-catalyzed opening of this meso-epoxide involves water attacking either C4 or C5.\n    *   Attack at C4 (an R center) inverts it to S, yielding the (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 (an S center) inverts it to R, yielding the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Since attack at either carbon is equally likely, they are formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and thus will have different retention times and appear as separate peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show one peak for the meso-diol and a second, single peak for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R) + (4S,5S)).\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment inside the column.\n    *   In this chiral environment, enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times. Thus, enantiomers can be separated.\n    *   Diastereomers will also be separated.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
