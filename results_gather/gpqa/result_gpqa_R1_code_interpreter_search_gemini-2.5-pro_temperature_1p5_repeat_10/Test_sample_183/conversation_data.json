    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's draw its structure and number the benzene ring according to IUPAC rules, giving the principal functional group (ether) the lowest possible number.\n- Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n- Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n- Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3-pattern, which is often challenging to achieve via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) due to the directing effects of the groups.\n\n**2. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\nA common strategy for synthesizing ethers like this is the Williamson Ether Synthesis. This suggests the last step is the reaction of a phenoxide with an alkyl halide.\n- **Final Step:** Williamson Ether Synthesis. The precursor would be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. Reacting it with a base (like NaOH) and ethyl bromide (EtBr) would yield the final product.\n  - `2-tBu-3-NO2-phenol + NaOH/EtBr -> 2-tBu-1-OEt-3-NO2-benzene`\n\n- **Precursor to the Phenol:** Phenols are often synthesized from primary aromatic amines via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. The precursor to 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol would be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n  - `2-tBu-3-NO2-aniline --(NaNO2/HCl, then H3O+/Heat)--> 2-tBu-3-NO2-phenol`\n\n- **Precursor to the Aniline:** The intermediate, 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline, has an amino group, a tert-butyl group, and a nitro group. A common way to get an aniline is by reducing a nitro group. However, here we need to add a nitro group to an existing aniline. The precursor would be **2-tert-butylaniline**. We would then need to nitrate it at position 3.\n  - `2-tBu-aniline --(Nitration)--> 2-tBu-3-NO2-aniline`\n\n- **Precursor to 2-tert-butylaniline:** This can be made by reducing the corresponding nitro compound, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n  - `1-tBu-2-NO2-benzene --(Fe/HCl)--> 2-tBu-aniline`\n\n- **Precursor to 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene:** This can be formed by the nitration of **tert-butylbenzene**. Direct nitration gives a mixture of ortho and para products, with the para isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) being the major product due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group. To achieve a \"high-yield\" synthesis, a blocking group strategy is often employed, but we will first check the sequences as given.\n  - `tBu-benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 1-tBu-2-NO2-benzene` (ortho isomer needed)\n\n- **Precursor to tert-butylbenzene:** This is made from benzene via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n  - `Benzene --(tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3)--> tBu-benzene`\n\n**3. Assembling the Forward Synthesis and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on our retrosynthesis, the logical sequence of transformations is:\n*Alkylation -> Nitration -> Reduction -> Nitration -> Diazotization -> Hydrolysis -> Etherification*\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on this logical pathway.\n\n*   **Option A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. Step (iv), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), requires a primary amine, but the product after step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine.\n\n*   **Option B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. Step (vi) involves reacting a diazonium salt (from step v) with nitric acid (HNO3/H2SO4). This is not a standard reaction to achieve the desired product; hydrolysis (H3O+) is needed to form a phenol.\n\n*   **Option D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline (the product of step ii). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the lone pair on the nitrogen coordinates strongly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring.\n\n*   **Option C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**\n    Let's trace this sequence step-by-step:\n    i.   **tBuCl/AlCl3**: Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    ii.  **HNO3/H2SO4**: tert-butylbenzene is nitrated. We need the ortho isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. (This step has yield issues, but is plausible).\n    iii. **Fe/HCl**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    iv.  **HNO3/H2SO4**: 2-tert-butylaniline is nitrated. This is the most problematic step for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, as direct nitration of the corresponding anilinium ion heavily favors other isomers. However, for the synthesis to proceed, we must assume the formation of the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    v.   **NaNO2/HCl**: The primary amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    vi.  **H3O+, H2O/Heat**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    vii. **NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ether, yielding the final product **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThe sequence of steps (i) through (vii) is the only one that follows a chemically logical path to construct the target molecule from benzene, matching our retrosynthesis. The presence of the superfluous steps (viii) and (ix) at the end, and the known regiochemical issue in step (iv), indicate that the question is likely flawed. However, compared to the other options which contain definitive chemical impossibilities in their sequences, Option C represents the only plausible, albeit imperfect, pathway.\n\n<<<C>>>"
