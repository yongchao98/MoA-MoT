    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H NMR data:** Compound A shows two signals.\n    *   A triplet at 0.9 ppm with an integration of 6H. A triplet indicates a group adjacent to a -CH2- group. The 6H suggests two equivalent -CH3 groups. This points to two -CH2CH3 (ethyl) groups.\n    *   A quartet at 1.3 ppm with an integration of 4H. A quartet indicates a group adjacent to a -CH3 group. The 4H suggests two equivalent -CH2- groups. This also points to two -CH2CH3 (ethyl) groups.\n*   **Determine the structure:** The data (two equivalent ethyl groups, total 10 hydrogens) and the low chemical shifts (0.9 ppm and 1.3 ppm are in the alkane region) strongly suggest an alkane structure. The simplest symmetrical alkane with two ethyl groups is n-butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3).\n    *   Due to symmetry, the two -CH3 groups are equivalent, and the two -CH2- groups are equivalent.\n    *   The -CH3 groups (6H) are adjacent to a -CH2- group, giving a triplet.\n    *   The -CH2- groups (4H) are adjacent to both a -CH3 (3H) and another -CH2- (2H). The signal would be a multiplet, but it is often simplified as a quartet in introductory problems, especially since the coupling to the adjacent -CH3 is strong. The chemical shifts match perfectly for n-butane.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Compound A is n-butane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. This is a free-radical halogenation.\n*   **Product analysis:** There are two possible positions for bromination on n-butane: the primary carbons (C1, C4) and the secondary carbons (C2, C3).\n*   **Selectivity:** Free-radical bromination is highly selective for the most stable radical intermediate. The stability of radicals is tertiary > secondary > primary. Therefore, substitution at the secondary carbon is heavily favored.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The major product, Compound B, is 2-bromobutane (CH3-CH(Br)-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is an E2 elimination reaction.\n*   **Product analysis:** The base (OH-) can abstract a proton from either C1 or C3.\n    *   Abstraction from C1 leads to but-1-ene (Hofmann product).\n    *   Abstraction from C3 leads to but-2-ene (Zaitsev product).\n*   **Zaitsev's Rule:** Elimination reactions favor the formation of the more substituted (more stable) alkene. But-2-ene is disubstituted, while but-1-ene is monosubstituted. Thus, but-2-ene is the major product.\n*   **Isomerism:** The problem states that C has two geometrical isomers. But-2-ene exists as cis (Z) and trans (E) isomers.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Compound C is but-2-ene. The reaction uses the cis-isomer of C (cis-but-2-ene).\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound D**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition reaction.\n    *   **Dienophile:** The cis-isomer of C, which is cis-but-2-ene.\n    *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n*   **Analyzing the Diene:** The IUPAC name is unusual. Standard naming would prioritize the alcohol, making it a penta-2,4-dien-1-ol. However, let's deduce the structure from the given name. \"penta-1,3-diene\" suggests a C1=C2-C3=C4-C5 backbone. A \"1-ol\" means an -OH group is on C1. This leads to the structure HO-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH3. The reacting diene system involves C1 through C4. The substituents on the diene that will be on the final ring are an -OH group at C1 and a -CH3 group at C4. The (1E,3E) designation describes their stereochemistry.\n*   **Analyzing the Product:** The product of a Diels-Alder reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a cyclohexene ring.\n    *   The dienophile (cis-but-2-ene) provides two cis-oriented methyl groups. These will be on adjacent carbons (C5 and C6) of the product ring.\n    *   The diene provides the other four carbons of the ring (C1, C2, C3, C4), the double bond (C2=C3), the -OH group (at C1), and the third methyl group (at C4).\n    *   Thus, the product is a 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol. This eliminates options B and C, which have a different substitution pattern.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder Reaction:**\n    1.  **Diene Stereochemistry:** Normally, an (E,E)-diene gives a product where the substituents at C1 and C4 are trans. However, this leads to a product whose stereochemistry, (1S,4S), is not among the options. An important exception can occur when one substituent can form an intramolecular hydrogen bond, as the -OH group can here. This can lock the diene into a specific s-cis conformation that leads to the two substituents (OH and CH3) being **cis** in the final product. This cis relationship corresponds to the (1S, 4R) configuration given in options A and D.\n    2.  **Dienophile Stereochemistry:** The cis geometry of the dienophile (cis-but-2-ene) is retained, meaning the methyl groups at C5 and C6 are **cis** to each other in the product.\n    3.  **Endo/Exo Selectivity:** The final piece of stereochemistry is the relative orientation of the diene's substituents to the dienophile's substituents. This is determined by the transition state geometry (endo or exo).\n        *   **Endo Addition (kinetic product):** The substituents on the dienophile are oriented \"under\" the diene system. This would place all four substituents (OH, Me at C4, Me at C5, Me at C6) on the same side of the ring (all cis). This structure has the configuration **(1S, 4R, 5R, 6S)**. This is not among the options.\n        *   **Exo Addition (thermodynamic product):** The substituents on the dienophile are oriented \"away\" from the diene system. This places the dienophile's methyl groups (at C5 and C6) on the opposite side of the ring from the diene's substituents (OH at C1 and Me at C4). The resulting structure has the OH and C4-Me as cis (wedge), and the C5-Me and C6-Me as cis to each other but trans to the first pair (dash).\n*   **Assigning Configuration to the Exo Product:**\n    *   Structure: C1-OH (Wedge), C4-Me (Wedge), C5-Me (Dash), C6-Me (Dash).\n    *   Configuration at C1: S\n    *   Configuration at C4: R\n    *   Configuration at C5: S\n    *   Configuration at C6: R\n    *   The full configuration for the exo product is **(1S, 4R, 5S, 6R)**.\n\nThis configuration matches option D. Therefore, Compound D is the exo product of the reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
