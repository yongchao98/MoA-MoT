    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the structure of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine.**\n*   Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone with the formula C₆H₁₀O.\n*   The reaction of a ketone with bromine in the presence of an acid or base catalyst results in the substitution of a hydrogen atom on an α-carbon (a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group) with a bromine atom.\n*   Cyclohexanone has two equivalent α-carbons (C2 and C6). The reaction will place a bromine atom on one of these carbons.\n*   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide.**\n*   Product 1, 2-bromocyclohexanone, is an α-haloketone.\n*   When an α-haloketone with an α'-hydrogen (a hydrogen on the other α-carbon) is treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH), it undergoes a classic reaction called the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n*   The mechanism is as follows:\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes the acidic proton from the α'-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, opening the three-membered ring. The ring opens by breaking the bond between the carbonyl carbon and the more substituted α-carbon to form the more stable carbanion. In this case, breaking the C1-C6 bond results in a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylate group attached.\n    5.  An acidic workup (which is assumed) protonates the carboxylate to give a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n*   An alternative reaction, such as elimination to form cyclohex-2-enone, is less likely because the subsequent reaction with thionyl chloride is not a standard transformation for an enone. The Favorskii rearrangement pathway is consistent with the subsequent reaction steps.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.**\n*   This is the standard procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride reacts with the carboxylic acid group (-COOH), replacing the -OH with a -Cl. Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is converted to cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(O-t-Bu)₃H).**\n*   This is a mild and bulky reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than LiAlH₄ and will stop the reduction at the aldehyde stage without proceeding to the primary alcohol.\n*   Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is reduced to cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. Let's analyze its structure to determine the number of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms. This is equivalent to determining the number of signals we would see in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring with a -CHO (aldehyde) group attached. Let's number the carbons: C1 is the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group, C2/C5 are adjacent to C1, and C3/C4 are the remaining two carbons.\n\nThe molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C, H, and O atoms), the C1 carbon and its attached hydrogen, and bisects the C3-C4 bond. This symmetry makes certain atoms chemically equivalent.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen (H-a):** The hydrogen atom of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. This is one type of hydrogen.\n2.  **C1-Hydrogen (H-b):** The single hydrogen atom on C1 is also in a unique environment, being attached to the carbon that bears the aldehyde group. This is a second type of hydrogen.\n3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:**\n    *   Due to the plane of symmetry, the two hydrogens on C2 are equivalent to the two hydrogens on C5.\n    *   However, the two hydrogens on C2 itself are not equivalent. They are **diastereotopic**. One hydrogen is *cis* to the aldehyde group (in the average conformation), and the other is *trans*. They have different spatial relationships with the rest of the molecule and are therefore chemically distinct.\n    *   This gives us two more types of hydrogens: the two *cis* hydrogens (on C2 and C5) are one type, and the two *trans* hydrogens (on C2 and C5) are another type.\n4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:**\n    *   Similarly, due to the plane of symmetry, the two hydrogens on C3 are equivalent to the two hydrogens on C4.\n    *   The two hydrogens on C3 are also **diastereotopic**. Their chemical environments are different because of their spatial relationship to the chiral information propagating from the substituent at C1.\n    *   This gives us two final types of hydrogens: one set of two equivalent hydrogens (on C3 and C4) and another set of two equivalent hydrogens (on C3 and C4).\n\n**Summary of distinct hydrogen types:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton)\n*   Type 2: C1 H (1 proton)\n*   Type 3: C2/C5 *cis*-like H's (2 protons)\n*   Type 4: C2/C5 *trans*-like H's (2 protons)\n*   Type 5: C3/C4 *cis*-like H's (2 protons)\n*   Type 6: C3/C4 *trans*-like H's (2 protons)\n\nIn total, there are **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<C>>>"
