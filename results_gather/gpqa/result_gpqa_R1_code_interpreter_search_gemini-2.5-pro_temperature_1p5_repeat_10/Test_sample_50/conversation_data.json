    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Setup and the Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded conducting sphere is an equipotential surface with a potential of `V=0`.\n\nThis electrostatic problem can be simplified using the **method of images**. We can replace the conducting sphere and its induced surface charge with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition, which is that the potential on the surface of the sphere (`r=R`) is zero.\n\nThe standard results for the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (measured from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to `q`) are:\n*   **Image charge value:** `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe electric field and potential *outside* the sphere (`r > R`) are now correctly described by the superposition of the fields from the original point charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity (where the potential is zero) to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere, while the sphere is held at `V=0`.\n\n`U = W_ext = ∫_∞^d F_ext ⋅ dr`\n\nWhere `F_ext` is the external force required to move the charge, which is equal and opposite to the electrostatic force `F_e` exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n\n`F_ext = - F_e`\n\nThe force `F_e` exerted by the induced charges on the sphere on the charge `q` is, by the method of images, equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'` on `q`.\n\nLet's calculate this force when the charge `q` is at a generic distance `x` from the center (`x > R`):\n*   Force on `q` due to `q'`: `F_e(x)`\n*   Position of `q`: `x`\n*   Position of `q'(x)`: `b(x) = R^2/x`\n*   Value of `q'(x)`: `q'(x) = - (R/x) * q`\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'`: `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`\n\nThe force is attractive (towards the sphere):\n`F_e(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`\n`F_e(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F_e(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n`F_e(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) * (x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2)`\n`F_e(x) = - k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we can calculate the work done (potential energy `U`):\n`U = ∫_∞^d F_ext dx = ∫_∞^d -F_e(x) dx`\n`U = ∫_∞^d [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve this integral, we use a substitution:\nLet `u = x^2 - R^2`. Then `du = 2x dx`, so `x dx = du/2`.\n\n`U = k * q^2 * R ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2)`\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) ∫ u^-2 du`\n\nThe integral of `u^-2` is `-u^-1 = -1/u`.\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u]` (evaluated at the bounds corresponding to `x`)\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1 / (x^2 - R^2)] |_∞^d`\n\nNow, apply the limits:\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ (-1 / (d^2 - R^2)) - (-1 / (∞^2 - R^2)) ]`\nThe term with infinity goes to zero.\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1 / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 3. Alternative Method (Using Potential)\n\nThe interaction energy of a charge distribution is `U = (1/2) ∫ ρV dτ`. For our system of a point charge `q` and a conducting body (the sphere), the energy is:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_q + (1/2) ∫_sphere σV_sphere dA`\n\n*   `V_sphere = 0` (grounded sphere), so the second term is zero.\n*   `V_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` due to *all other charges* (i.e., the induced charges on the sphere). This self-energy of `q` is not included.\n*   This potential from the induced charges is, by the method of images, the same as the potential from the image charge `q'`.\n\nSo, `V_q = V_induced = V_from_q'`.\nThe distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b=R^2/d`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nThis matches option C.\n\nLet's quickly check the given options:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect, has `R^2`.\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect, missing `1/2` and has `d` instead of `R`.\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct.**\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect denominator and numerator.\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
