    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Starting Material (Substrate)\n\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n*   **Structure:** The name `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring where one atom of the three-membered ring is an oxygen. This is an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configuration is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S). Let's determine the orientation of the substituents based on this information. A common convention for fused rings is to assume the smaller ring (the epoxide) is on the 'top' face (beta, wedge).\n    *   **Epoxide Fusion:** The epoxide bridge (C1-O-C6) must be *cis*-fused to the cyclohexane ring. Let's assume the oxygen atom is 'up' (beta).\n    *   **Configuration at C1 (1R):** The groups attached to C1 are O, C6, C2, and a methyl group. According to Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules, the priority is O > C6 > C2 > -CH3. For a (1R) configuration, with the lowest priority group (-CH3) pointing away ('down' or alpha), the path from O → C6 → C2 must be clockwise. This holds if the C1-methyl group is 'down' (alpha).\n    *   **Configuration at C6 (6S):** The groups at C6 are O, C1, C5, and H. Priority: O > C1 > C5 > H. For a (6S) configuration, with the lowest priority group (H) pointing 'down' (alpha), the path O → C1 → C5 must be counter-clockwise. This is correct.\n    *   **Configuration at C3 (3R) and C4 (4R):** These stereocenters are on the cyclohexane ring. Their configuration is given. (3R) and (4R) define the specific spatial arrangement of the methyl groups at these positions. These configurations are fixed and will not change during the reaction.\n\n**Summary of Reactant Structure:**\n*   A cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across C1-C6.\n*   The epoxide oxygen is 'up' (beta).\n*   The methyl group at C1 is 'down' (alpha).\n*   The hydrogen at C6 is 'down' (alpha).\n*   The methyl groups at C3 and C4 have specific 'up' or 'down' orientations to satisfy the (3R) and (4R) configuration.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate) is a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n### 3. Determine the Regioselectivity and Stereoselectivity\n\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem states that the \"alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring\".\n    *   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**. The nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻) will attack C6.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The problem states that \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added\". This is characteristic of an Sₙ2-type reaction.\n    *   The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the leaving group (the C-O bond).\n    *   Since the C6-O bond is 'up' (beta), the incoming methyl nucleophile must attack from the 'down' (alpha) side.\n    *   This backside attack causes an **inversion of the stereocenter at C6**. The configuration at C6 was (6S), so it will invert.\n    *   The C1-O bond breaks, and the oxygen atom, which remains attached to C1, is protonated during aqueous workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n### 4. Determine the Product Structure and Name\n\n1.  **Connectivity:** The attack at C6 opens the epoxide to form a cyclohexanol. The original C1 now has an -OH group and a methyl group. The original C6 now has a new methyl group. The methyl groups at C3 and C4 are unchanged.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. The old C6 is now C2. We number the ring to give the lowest locants to the substituents. This results in methyl groups at C1, C2, C4, and C5.\n    *   The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethyl).\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configurations of the stereocenters that are not involved in the reaction remain unchanged. The configuration of the center that is attacked is inverted.\n    *   **Product C1 (from reactant C1):** The configuration is retained. It was (1R), so it remains **(1R)**.\n    *   **Product C4 (from reactant C4):** The configuration is retained. It was (4R), so it remains **(4R)**.\n    *   **Product C5 (from reactant C3):** The configuration is retained. It was (3R), so it remains **(5R)**.\n    *   **Product C2 (from reactant C6):** The configuration is inverted. It was (6S). We must determine the new R/S designation.\n        *   Reactant C6 groups and priorities: O > C1 > C5 > H. Configuration: (S).\n        *   Product C2 groups and priorities: C1(has OH) > C3 > -CH₃(new) > H. The priorities of the groups have changed.\n        *   Let's analyze the geometry. At C6, the H was 'down' (alpha). During the Sₙ2 attack, the new methyl group enters from the 'down' side, and the original H atom is pushed 'up' (beta). So at the new C2, we have the new methyl group 'down' and H 'up'.\n        *   To assign the configuration at C2: The highest priority group is C1. The lowest priority group is H. The H is pointing 'up' (towards the viewer, if the ring is flat). The path from C1 → C3 → -CH₃ is clockwise. Since the lowest priority group (H) is pointing towards us, we must reverse the result. Clockwise (R) → **(S)**.\n        *   So the configuration at C2 is **(2S)**.\n\n3.  **Final Product Name:** Combining the configurations, the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### 5. Compare with Options\n*   A) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect connectivity.\n*   B) **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** - **Matches our derived product.**\n*   C) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect connectivity and stereochemistry.\n*   D) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
