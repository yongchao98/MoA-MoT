    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate (nucleophile precursor), methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (Michael acceptor), and sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH) (base/solvent).\n*   **Step 1: Nucleophile Formation.** Sodium ethoxide is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate. The α-protons are acidic because the resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by resonance across two adjacent ester carbonyl groups.\n    *   `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt → Na⁺[⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂] + EtOH`\n    *   The nucleophile is the malonate anion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition.** The Michael acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The nucleophilic malonate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon (the carbon bonded to the p-tolyl group).\n    *   The attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond and a resonance-stabilized enolate intermediate: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH⁻-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Step 3: Protonation.** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent, ethanol, to yield the final neutral product (A).\n    *   `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH⁻-COOCH₃ + EtOH → p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n*   **Step 4: Naming the Product (A).** The structure is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`. To name this according to IUPAC rules as a tricarboxylate, we identify the main propane chain.\n    *   `C¹H(COOMe)₂ - C²H(p-tolyl) - C³H₂(COOMe)` is not the correct connectivity based on the reaction mechanism.\n    *   The correct structure derived is `p-tolyl-CH[CH(COOCH₃)₂]-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   Let's find the correct IUPAC name based on the options. The name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" corresponds to the structure `(MeOOC)₂-C¹H - C²H(p-tolyl) - C³H₂(COOMe)`. Let's map the atoms from the reaction to this structure.\n        *   The `CH(COOMe)₂` group comes from dimethyl malonate. Let's call this C1.\n        *   This C1 attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate, which is `CH(p-tolyl)`. Let's call this C2.\n        *   C2 is bonded to the α-carbon of the acrylate, which becomes `CH₂(COOMe)`. Let's call this C3.\n        *   The resulting structure is `(MeOOC)₂C¹H - C²H(p-tolyl) - C³H₂(COOMe)`. This perfectly matches the product derived from the mechanism.\n    *   Thus, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine (an enamine, the nucleophile), (E)-but-2-enenitrile (Michael acceptor), followed by workup with H₃O⁺. This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which is a type of Michael addition.\n*   **Step 1: Nucleophile and Acceptor.** The enamine is nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). The acceptor is `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`, and the β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition.** The α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a C-C bond and an intermediate containing an iminium ion on the cyclohexane ring and a carbanion α to the nitrile group.\n*   **Step 3: Protonation and Hydrolysis.** The carbanion is protonated (likely by the methanol solvent). Then, the addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group. Since the enamine was formed from cyclohexanone, it hydrolyzes back to cyclohexanone.\n*   **Step 4: Structure of the Product (B).** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2). The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile acceptor. The new bond is between C2 of the ring and C3 of the butene chain.\n    *   The side chain is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n    *   To name the compound, the nitrile is the principal functional group. The chain is a butanenitrile. The cyclohexanone is a substituent at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major product after acidic workup, not the enol form (`3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`).\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** An unknown reactant C and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Analysis (Retrosynthesis).** This is a Michael addition. The product is formed by adding a nucleophile to the Michael acceptor, MVK (`CH₂=CH-COCH₃`).\n*   **Step 1: Identify the bond formed.** The product is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` with a `-(CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃)` group at C2. This \"3-oxobutyl\" group is derived from MVK. A nucleophile must have attacked the β-carbon (`CH₂`) of MVK, which after protonation gives the `-CH₂CH₂COCH₃` group.\n*   **Step 2: Identify the nucleophile.** The nucleophile must therefore be the part of the molecule that is attached to this group, which is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring, attached via C2.\n*   **Step 3: Identify Reactant C.** The active nucleophile is the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`, formed by deprotonation of the highly acidic proton at C2 (located between two carbonyls) by the base (KOH). Therefore, the starting material **C must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing this with the given options, only option B matches all three results.\n\n<<<B>>>"
