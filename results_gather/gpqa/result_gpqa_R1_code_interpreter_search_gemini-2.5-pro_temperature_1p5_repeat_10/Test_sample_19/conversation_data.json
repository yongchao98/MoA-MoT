    "The user wants me to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Concept:** The \"impulse approximation\" simplifies a complex many-body problem (an interaction with a nucleus) into a simpler one. It assumes that the interaction happens with just one nucleon inside the nucleus, and that this nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle during the brief moment of interaction. The name \"impulse\" suggests a very short, sudden event where the interaction energy is much greater than the energies holding the nucleon in the nucleus.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each assumption:**\n    *   **Assumption 1: \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"** This is the foundation of the approximation. If the interaction involved multiple nucleons simultaneously (e.g., through meson-exchange currents), we could not simplify the problem to a single-nucleon interaction. This must be part of the correct answer. This is often called the \"one-body current\" assumption.\n    *   **Assumption 2: \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"** This deals with what happens before and after the main interaction. It assumes the incoming probe doesn't interact with other nucleons on its way in, and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) don't interact with the remaining nucleons on their way out (no \"final-state interactions\"). If these additional interactions occurred, the final measured energy and momentum would not reflect a clean, single-nucleon event, invalidating the simple picture. This is a crucial part of making the approximation experimentally verifiable and theoretically simple.\n    *   **Assumption 3: \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"** This assumption describes the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation, however, is about the nucleon's relationship with its *nuclear environment*. One can apply the impulse approximation in high-energy scattering experiments (like deep inelastic scattering) where the quarks are highly relativistic. Therefore, this assumption is not a general requirement for the impulse approximation. It might be a feature of a specific low-energy model, but it's not a defining characteristic of the impulse approximation itself.\n    *   **Assumption 4: \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"** This is the very essence of the \"impulse\" idea. The nucleon is bound to the nucleus by a potential. This assumption states that the interaction time is so short, and the energy/momentum transferred is so large, that the binding potential and the nucleon's slow motion within the nucleus can be ignored *during* the interaction. The nucleon is effectively \"frozen\" in its orbital at the moment of the high-energy collision and reacts as if it were free.\n\n3.  **Synthesize:**\n    *   Assumption 1 is required to isolate the interaction to a single entity.\n    *   Assumption 4 is required to treat that entity as \"free\" of the nuclear potential during the hit.\n    *   Assumption 2 is required to ensure that the initial and final states of the experiment are not complicated by other interactions, thus preserving the signature of a single, free-particle collision.\n    *   Assumption 3 is not required; it's about a different level of physics (sub-nucleonic structure) than what the impulse approximation primarily addresses (the nucleon's behavior within the nucleus).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The three necessary assumptions are 1, 2, and 4. This combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
