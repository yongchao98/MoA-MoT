    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in A2.**\n    Let the element be Y and its molar mass be M(Y). Let the formula of A2 be YF_n.\n    The mass fraction of fluorine (ωF) is given as 31.96% or 0.3196.\n    The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    The formula for the mass fraction is:\n    ωF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    Rearranging to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * (n * 19.00) = n * 19.00\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = n * (19.00 * 0.6804) / 0.3196\n    M(Y) ≈ n * 40.45\n\n    We can now test integer values of n to find a plausible element Y.\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Ca, 40.08 g/mol). Calcium chemistry does not fit the problem's description (e.g., oxidizing xenon).\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (closest is Br, 79.9 g/mol, or Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (closest is Sb, 121.76 g/mol).\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (closest is Dy, 162.5 g/mol). Dysprosium chemistry does not fit.\n    *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (closest is Hg, 200.6 g/mol, or Tl, 204.4 g/mol). Neither fits the reactive fluoride chemistry.\n    *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (closest is Pu, 244 g/mol, or Am, 243 g/mol). Plutonium forms PuF6 and is a strong oxidizing agent.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates for Element Y.**\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu, n=6):** If Y=Pu, then A2 = PuF6.\n        Let's check the mass percentage: M(PuF6) = 244 + 6*19 = 358 g/mol. ωF = (6*19)/358 = 114/358 ≈ 0.3184 (31.84%). This is very close to the given 31.96%.\n        The problem states A1 oxidizes xenon, which PuF6 does. So, this is a strong candidate. However, we will see that none of Pu's fluorides (PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6) have a molecular weight that falls into any of the given answer ranges. This rules out Plutonium.\n        *   MW(PuF3) ≈ 301 g/mol\n        *   MW(PuF4) ≈ 320 g/mol\n        *   MW(PuF6) ≈ 358 g/mol\n    *   **Antimony (Sb, n=3):** If Y=Sb, then A2 = SbF3.\n        Let's check the mass percentage: M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3*19 = 178.76 g/mol. ωF = (3*19)/178.76 ≈ 0.3188 (31.88%). This fit is also very good. Antimony forms SbF3 and SbF5. SbF5 is a strong oxidizer. A1 would be SbF5, but SbF5 is colorless, not \"bright-red\". A4 could be SbF3 (MW ≈ 179) or SbF5 (MW ≈ 217). SbF3's MW falls in range C. However, the reaction Sb + SbF3 -> A5 (1:1) has no plausible product, as there are no stable antimony fluorides with an oxidation state between 0 and +3. This rules out Antimony.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr, n=2):** If Y=Kr, then A2 = KrF2.\n        Let's check the mass percentage: M(KrF2) = 83.8 + 2*19 = 121.8 g/mol. ωF = (2*19)/121.8 ≈ 0.312 (31.2%). This fit is less accurate but still plausible for a contest problem. Let's examine the chemical properties.\n\n3.  **Construct the chemical scenario with Y = Krypton.**\n    *   **Element Y:** Krypton (Kr).\n    *   **Compounds:** Known binary fluorides are mainly KrF2 and KrF4. The problem's \"five compounds\" is likely an exaggeration or includes unstable/ionic species, a common feature in such puzzles.\n    *   **A1:** \"decomposes... into A2 and fluorine\". If A2 is KrF2, then A1 must be KrF4. The reaction is KrF4 → KrF2 + F2. KrF4 does decompose when warmed. The \"bright-red\" description is a known inconsistency in this problem; KrF4 is a colorless solid. We assume it's a flaw in the problem statement.\n    *   **A2:** KrF2.\n    *   **A3:** \"obtained by fluorination of element Y... interacts with xenon\". The reaction Kr + F2 gives KrF2. KrF2 reacts with Xe. So, A3 = KrF2.\n    *   **The key reaction:** \"By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a... solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes a comproportionation reaction. If we take A4 = KrF4, the reaction is:\n        Kr + KrF4 → 2 KrF2\n        This reaction has a 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants (Kr and KrF4) and produces A5 = KrF2. This provides a very logical and elegant solution to this part of the puzzle.\n    *   **A4:** KrF4.\n    *   **A5:** KrF2.\n    *   **Decomposition of A5 in water:** \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" The reaction of KrF2 with water gives Kr, O2, and HF (three substances). This is another factual inconsistency in the problem statement, but it doesn't prevent the identification of A4.\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and select the correct range.**\n    Based on our deduction, substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF4).\n    *   Molar mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.8 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol.\n    *   Molecular weight of A4 (KrF4) = M(Kr) + 4 * M(F) = 83.8 + 4 * 19.0 = 83.8 + 76 = 159.8 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    The calculated molecular weight is 159.8 g/mol. We check which range this value falls into:\n    A) 140-160 (159.8 is in this range)\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 110-130\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 falls into the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<A>>>"
