    "This is a common colloquialism used by chemists, particularly those in synthetic organic chemistry who rely heavily on purification techniques. Let's break down the phrase and the context.\n\n*   **The Context:** A synthetic organic chemist's job involves running a chemical reaction to create a desired compound. The resulting mixture almost always contains the desired product, unreacted starting materials, byproducts, and reagents. The crucial next step is to purify the desired compound from this mixture.\n*   **The Problem:** \"My compounds are on top of each other\" is a phrase used to describe a failure in a separation or purification technique.\n*   **The Technique:** The most common purification technique in a synthetic organic chemistry lab is **chromatography** (e.g., Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) for analysis, or column chromatography for bulk separation). Chromatography separates compounds based on their physical properties, most importantly their **polarity**.\n*   **How it Works:** In chromatography, a mixture is applied to a stationary phase (like silica gel), and a mobile phase (a solvent) is passed over it.\n    *   Less polar compounds interact weakly with the polar stationary phase and are carried along quickly by the mobile phase.\n    *   More polar compounds interact strongly with the polar stationary phase and move more slowly.\n*   **What \"On Top of Each Other\" Means:** When visualizing the separation (for example, on a TLC plate), the different compounds appear as separate \"spots\" at different heights. If two compounds have very **similar polarities**, they will move at nearly the same rate through the chromatography setup. On a TLC plate, this means their spots will be very close together or merge into a single, larger spot. They are literally \"on top of each other.\" This makes them extremely difficult or impossible to separate using that chromatographic system.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n*   A) **Similar optical rotations:** This is a property used for characterization, not typically separation (though specialized chiral chromatography exists). One wouldn't typically use the phrase \"on top of each other\" to describe this.\n*   C) **Non-covalent interactions:** While these interactions are the *underlying reason* for properties like polarity, the phrase describes the *observable outcome* of a failed separation, not the fundamental forces themselves. The similarity in polarity is the direct cause of the separation issue.\n*   D) **Similar boiling points:** This would make separation by distillation difficult. While it's a valid separation problem, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more strongly and frequently associated with the overlapping spots or peaks in chromatography, not the fractions from a distillation.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is almost certainly referring to a failed chromatographic separation due to the compounds having very similar polarities.\n\n<<<B>>>"
