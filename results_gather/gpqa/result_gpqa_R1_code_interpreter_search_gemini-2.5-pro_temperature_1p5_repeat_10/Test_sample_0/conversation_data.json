    "Here's the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty or \"spread\" in its energy. This relationship is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n2.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) must be greater than or equal to a constant value, ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    \n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    \n    In this context, Δt is the lifetime of the state (τ), and ΔE is the inherent uncertainty in its energy level, often called the natural linewidth or decay width (Γ). For an order-of-magnitude calculation, the relationship is often simplified to:\n    \n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Identify the Lifetimes and Calculate Energy Uncertainties:**\n    *   State 1 has a lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ seconds.\n    *   State 2 has a lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ seconds.\n    \n    The state with the *shorter* lifetime will have the *larger* energy uncertainty. Therefore, state 1 will be \"broader\" in energy than state 2.\n    \n    To calculate the energy uncertainty in electron volts (eV), we need the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in eV·s.\n    \n    ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n    \n    Now, let's calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state:\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n4.  **Condition for \"Clearly Resolved\":** For two energy levels to be clearly distinguished or resolved, the difference in their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than the width of the energy levels. A common criterion (analogous to the Rayleigh criterion in optics) is that the separation must be at least as large as the width of the broader level.\n    \n    In this case, ΔE₁ is the larger uncertainty (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV). Therefore, to resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them must satisfy:\n    \n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n    |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:** We need to find the option that is greater than approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV (This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is even smaller)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV (This is also smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV (This is 1000 times larger than ~10⁻⁷ eV, so it is definitely greater than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The only energy difference large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\nHere is a Python script to formalize the calculation.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using the formula Delta_E = h_bar / tau\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Lifetime of state 1 (τ1): {tau1:.1e} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Lifetime of state 2 (τ2): {tau2:.1e} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\n\n# The minimum energy difference required for resolution must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties.\nrequired_energy_difference = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\nprint(f\"\\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than the larger uncertainty, which is {required_energy_difference:.3e} eV.\")\n\n# Check the given options\noptions = {\n    'A': 1e-9,\n    'B': 1e-11,\n    'C': 1e-8,\n    'D': 1e-4\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {option}) {value:.1e} eV is a possible energy difference.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option}) {value:.1e} eV is NOT a possible energy difference.\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem is based on the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states that the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (ΔE) is inversely proportional to its lifetime (Δt or τ). The relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ τ ≈ ħ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nThis uncertainty, ΔE, represents the natural linewidth or the \"fuzziness\" of the energy level. For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be clearly distinguished or \"resolved,\" the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the uncertainty associated with the levels. A common criterion is that the energy difference must be larger than the larger of the two energy uncertainties.\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:**\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n2.  **Determine the condition for resolution:**\n    To resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy uncertainty.\n    *   Required energy difference: |E1 - E2| > ΔE₁\n    *   |E1 - E2| > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n3.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    We need to find the option that is greater than ~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV (Less than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV (Less than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV (Less than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV (Greater than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly option D provides an energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two states, given the broader linewidth of the state with the 10⁻⁹ second lifetime.\n\n<<<D>>>"
