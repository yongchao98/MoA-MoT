    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the initial state and the dilution process.**\n    *   We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   We dilute this by adding 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   First, calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution, which is the solution we will be titrating.\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = Volume × Concentration = (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) × 0.05 mol/L = 0.020 L × 0.05 M = 0.001 moles.\n    *   Total volume after dilution = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L.\n    *   Concentration of diluted CH₃COOH = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.040 L = 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **Analyze the titration reaction and the equivalence point.**\n    *   The reaction is a weak acid (CH₃COOH) being titrated by a strong base (NaOH).\n    *   Reaction: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n    *   At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 moles.\n    *   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to reach equivalence = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n    *   \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.\n    *   This is the buffer region of the titration curve, where we have a mixture of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   At this point, 25% of the acid has become the conjugate base, and 75% remains as the acid.\n    *   The ratio of [Conjugate Base] / [Acid] is [CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n    *   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n    *   First, we need the pKa from the given Ka.\n        *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n        *   pKa = -log(Ka)\n    *   Then, we plug the values into the equation:\n        *   pH = pKa + log(1/3) = pKa - log(3)\n    *   Let's perform this calculation.\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the CH₃COOH has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n    *   We have 0.001 moles of CH₃COO⁻ in the solution.\n    *   The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the diluted acid plus the volume of NaOH added.\n        *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻):\n        *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions.\n        *   Reaction: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   To find the pH, we first need to find the pOH by calculating the [OH⁻] produced from this hydrolysis. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka, where Kw (the ion product of water) is 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C.\n    *   Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the equilibrium concentration of OH⁻.\n        *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, we can simplify this to Kb ≈ x² / 0.02.\n    *   Solve for x, which is [OH⁻].\n    *   Calculate pOH = -log[OH⁻].\n    *   Calculate pH = 14.00 - pOH.\n\n5.  **Perform the calculations using a script for precision.**\n    *   The steps above involve several calculations.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning behind the calculations:\n\n**1. Initial State and Dilution**\n\n*   First, we determine the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted.\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles = 0.05 mol/L × (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 mol\n*   Total volume after adding 20.00 cm³ of water:\n    *   Total Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L\n*   Concentration of the diluted acetic acid (the solution being titrated):\n    *   Concentration = Moles / Total Volume\n    *   Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   25% titration means that 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid and its conjugate base.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n*   Calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of [conjugate base] to [acid] is:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   The equivalence point is reached when the moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid (0.001 mol).\n*   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed:\n    *   Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   At this point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution:\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate:\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Use an ICE table to find the [OH⁻] at equilibrium (let [OH⁻] = x):\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Calculate pOH:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n*   Calculate pH:\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<D>>>"
