    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon that does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be CxHy. The mass percentage of hydrogen is given by `(y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H)) * 100%`.\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the formula becomes `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This value is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 â‰ˆ 0.142857`). Let's assume the mass percentage is 1/7.\n        *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n        *   `7y = 12x + y`\n        *   `6y = 12x`\n        *   `y = 2x`\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula `CnH2n` is either an alkene or a cycloalkane. Since Z is saturated, it must be a **cycloalkane**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X on a platinum catalyst. This type of reaction often involves hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (like Z) or aromatic.\n    *   The complete hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means any non-saturated component in Y must hydrogenate to Z. The most common stable product of dehydrogenation on Pt is an aromatic ring.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y.\n    *   Putting this together: Y is an equimolar mixture of the cycloalkane Z and a corresponding aromatic compound which, upon hydrogenation, also yields Z.\n    *   The simplest and most classic example of this system involves a six-membered ring. Let's assume Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**, which is a common solvent.\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound would be **benzene (C6H6)**. Upon hydrogenation (`C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12`), benzene gives cyclohexane.\n    *   So, we can hypothesize:\n        *   **Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**\n        *   **Mixture Y = Equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane (C6H12) and Benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   This hypothesis fits all the conditions for Y and Z.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   The reaction is `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane + Benzene`.\n    *   Since this is a 1:1 reaction producing a 1:1 mixture, we can deduce the elemental composition by balancing the atoms.\n        *   Reactants: A (CxHy) + B (CzHw)\n        *   Products: C6H12 + C6H6 = C12H18\n        *   Therefore, `A + B` must contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The fact that hydrogenation of mixture X also yields only Z (cyclohexane) implies that both A and B must have the same carbon skeleton as cyclohexane, i._e._, a six-membered ring.\n    *   So, both A and B are C6 compounds. Their formulas must be `C6Ha` and `C6Hb`.\n        *   `a + b = 18`\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and/or B must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X.\n\n4.  **Identify the components of Mixture X.**\n    *   We need to find two non-conjugated, unsaturated C6 ring compounds, C6Ha and C6Hb, such that `a + b = 18`.\n    *   Let's list the possibilities for unsaturated C6 ring compounds:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One double bond. Not conjugated. This is a candidate for A or B.\n        *   **Cyclohexa-1,3-diene (C6H8)**: Two double bonds. They are conjugated. This is ruled out by the problem statement.\n        *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**: Two double bonds. They are separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated. This is a candidate.\n    *   Let's try to form a pair (A, B) from these candidates.\n        *   If we take A = Cyclohexene (C6H10), we need B to be a C6H(18-10) = C6H8 compound. The only non-conjugated option is Cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n    *   So, Mixture X consists of:\n        *   **A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)**\n        *   **B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**\n    *   This pair fits all conditions: equimolar, both decolorize bromine water, no conjugated bonds, and their combined atom count matches the products. The reaction is a hydrogen transfer: the diene (C6H8) is oxidized to benzene (C6H6) by losing 2H, and the monoene (C6H10) is reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12) by gaining 2H.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Number of H atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n    *   Number of H atoms in Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
