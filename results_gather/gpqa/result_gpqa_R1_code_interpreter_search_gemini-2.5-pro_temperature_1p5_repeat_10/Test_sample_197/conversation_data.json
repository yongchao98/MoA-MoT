    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This fraction is often denoted as α₂.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:**\n    The solution contains a central metal ion, Co²⁺, and a ligand, SCN⁻. They form a series of complexes. The cobalt-containing species are:\n    *   Free cobalt ion: Co²⁺\n    *   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)]⁺\n    *   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₂] (the species of interest)\n    *   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n    *   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\n2.  **Define the equilibrium reactions and stability constants (β):**\n    The formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (β):\n    *   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺  ; β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n    *   Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]  ; β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n    *   Co²⁺ + 3 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ; β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n    *   Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n3.  **Express the total cobalt concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all species containing cobalt:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n4.  **Express concentrations of complexes in terms of [Co²⁺]:**\n    Using the stability constant definitions, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺] and the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻]:\n    *   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n5.  **Formulate the distribution coefficient (α):**\n    The fraction (or percentage) of any given species is its concentration divided by the total concentration c(Co). We are interested in α₂ for the [Co(SCN)₂] complex.\n    α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\n    Substitute the expressions from steps 3 and 4:\n    α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    The [Co²⁺] term is common to all terms in the numerator and denominator, so it can be canceled out:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n6.  **Use the given concentrations:**\n    The problem states the concentration of thiocyanate [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10⁻² M. Since the ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times higher than the metal ion concentration (0.01 M), it is a reasonable approximation to use [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M as the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand. The fraction α is independent of the total metal concentration under this assumption.\n\n7.  **Calculate the numerical value:**\n    We will now substitute the given values into the formula for α₂. Let L = [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.\n\n    *   **Denominator (D):**\n        D = 1 + β₁L + β₂L² + β₃L³ + β₄L⁴\n        D = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\n        D = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\n        D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.40 + 0.063 + 0.0016\n        D = 2.3646\n\n    *   **Numerator (N):**\n        N = β₂L²\n        N = 40 × (0.1)²\n        N = 40 × 0.01\n        N = 0.40\n\n    *   **Fraction (α₂):**\n        α₂ = N / D = 0.40 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    *   **Percentage:**\n        Percentage = α₂ × 100% = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThe following Python code confirms this calculation:\n```python\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Ligand concentration\nL = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the polynomial sum in the denominator\ndenominator = 1 + beta1*L + beta2*(L**2) + beta3*(L**3) + beta4*(L**4)\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the alpha_2 term\nnumerator_alpha2 = beta2 * (L**2)\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha2 = numerator_alpha2 / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_alpha2 = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: {percentage_alpha2:.1f}%\")\n```\n> The percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: 16.9%\n\nThe calculation shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], is 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem requires us to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt species in the solution.\n\n1.  **Define the system:**\n    *   Central ion: Co²⁺\n    *   Ligand: SCN⁻\n    *   Total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M\n    *   Total thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n\n2.  **Identify the species and stability constants (β):**\n    The stepwise formation of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes and their overall stability constants are:\n    *   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺`      (β₁)\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]`      (β₂)\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 3 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻`    (β₃)\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`  (β₄)\n\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n3.  **Formulate the fraction (α₂) of the desired complex:**\n    The fraction of a specific complex, say `[Co(SCN)ₙ]⁽²⁻ⁿ⁾`, denoted as αₙ, is given by its concentration divided by the total metal concentration. We are interested in α₂ for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex.\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\n    Using the definitions of the stability constants, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion `[Co²⁺]` and free ligand `[SCN⁻]` concentrations:\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n    Substituting these into the expression for `c(Co)`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n    Now, substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` and `c(Co)` into the formula for α₂:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the value:**\n    The problem gives `[SCN⁻]` as 0.1 M. Since the ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the metal ion concentration (0.01 M), we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` as equal to the total ligand concentration, 0.1 M.\n\n    Given values:\n    *   `β₁=9`\n    *   `β₂=40`\n    *   `β₃=63`\n    *   `β₄=16`\n    *   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1` M\n\n    Let's calculate the terms in the denominator first:\n    *   1\n    *   `β₁[SCN⁻]` = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n    Sum of denominator terms = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n    The numerator is `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`.\n\n    Now, calculate α₂:\n    `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n    To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\n    Percentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
