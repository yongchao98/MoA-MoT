    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness is a key indicator.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for a carboxylic acid (usually around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to identifying the specific structure lies in the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the signals described.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four proposed structures are saturated alkanoic acids, consistent with this information.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern tells us that a single proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** means it's coupled to **one** neighboring proton (n+1 = 2, so n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** means it's coupled to **two** neighboring protons (n+1 = 3, so n=2).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** means it's coupled to **three** neighboring protons (n+1 = 4, so n=3).\n    Therefore, the proton giving the `dtq` signal must be adjacent to a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern means a single proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** means it's coupled to **one** neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** means it's coupled to **two** neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** means it's coupled to another, different group of **two** neighboring protons (n=2).\n    Therefore, the proton giving the `dtt` signal must be adjacent to a CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n### 3. Evaluating Each Candidate Structure\n\nLet's assume the condensed formulas represent a linear carbon chain where groups in parentheses are branches on the preceding carbon. We will number the carbons starting from the COOH group as C1.\n\n**A) `CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH` -> 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   `H(3)` is coupled to `H(2)` (2H), `H(4)` (1H), and its methyl group (3H). This gives a **dtq**.\n*   `H(4)` is coupled to `H(3)` (1H), `H(5)` (3H), and its methyl group (3H). This gives a `dqq` (doublet of quartets of quartets).\n*   This structure has a `dtq` but **no `dtt`**.\n\n**B) `CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH` -> 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n*   `H(3)` is coupled to `H(2)` (1H), `H(4)` (2H), and its methyl group (3H). This gives a **dtq**.\n*   No other proton would give a `dtt` pattern.\n*   This structure has a `dtq` but **no `dtt`**.\n\n**C) `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH` -> 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\nLet's draw this structure and analyze the protons on the main chain.\n`CH₃(5)-CH(4)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Proton H(3):** This proton is on carbon 3. Its neighbors are:\n    *   The two `H(2)` protons on C2 (gives a **triplet**).\n    *   The one `H(4)` proton on C4 (gives a **doublet**).\n    *   The two protons of the `CH₂` group on its own ethyl side chain (gives a **triplet**).\n    *   The multiplicity for `H(3)` is therefore a doublet of triplets of triplets (**dtt**).\n*   **Proton H(4):** This proton is on carbon 4. Its neighbors are:\n    *   The one `H(3)` proton on C3 (gives a **doublet**).\n    *   The two protons of the `CH₂` group on its own ethyl side chain (gives a **triplet**).\n    *   The three `H(5)` protons of the terminal methyl group (gives a **quartet**).\n    *   The multiplicity for `H(4)` is therefore a doublet of triplets of quartets (**dtq**).\n*   This structure has **both a `dtt` and a `dtq`** signal, matching the experimental data.\n\n**D) `CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH` -> 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₂CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n*   `H(3)` is coupled to `H(2)` (1H), `H(4)` (2H), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl group (2H). This gives a **dtt**.\n*   `H(2)` is coupled to `H(3)` (1H) and the `CH₂` of its ethyl group (2H). This gives a `dt` (doublet of triplets).\n*   This structure has a `dtt` but **no `dtq`**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option C, **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, will produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
