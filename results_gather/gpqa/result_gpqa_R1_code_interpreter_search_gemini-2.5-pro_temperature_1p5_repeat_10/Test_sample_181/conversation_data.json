    "This question asks for the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation for space-charge-limited current (SCLC) is valid. Let's analyze the assumptions behind the derivation of this equation step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Nature of the Current (SCLC):** The term \"space-charge-limited current\" implies that the current is limited by the cloud of charge (space charge) injected into the semiconductor, not by the injection process itself or the intrinsic properties of the material.\n\n2.  **Carrier Type:** The standard Mott-Gurney model considers the simplest case where only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) is injected and is mobile within the device. Therefore, it applies to a **single-carrier device**. This immediately invalidates option B, which specifies a two-carrier device.\n\n3.  **Carrier Traps:** The equation $ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$ is the simplest form of the SCLC model. It assumes an ideal insulator or semiconductor with no electronic states (traps) within the bandgap that could capture and immobilize the injected carriers. If traps were present, the current would be significantly lower, and the voltage dependence would change, a scenario described by the trap-limited SCLC models. Thus, the Mott-Gurney law in its basic form is valid for a **trap-free** device.\n\n4.  **Contact Type (Carrier Injection):** For the current to be limited by the space charge and not by the contact's ability to supply carriers, the contact must be able to inject carriers freely into the device. This means there should be no significant energy barrier for carrier injection. Such a contact is known as an **Ohmic contact** or a \"perfectly injecting contact\". Mathematically, this boundary condition is expressed as the electric field being zero at the injecting electrode (E(x=0) = 0). A Schottky contact (option D) has an inherent energy barrier and would lead to injection-limited current (e.g., thermionic emission), not space-charge-limited current. Therefore, the device must have an Ohmic contact, or equivalently, **no carrier injection barrier**.\n\n5.  **Transport Mechanism (Drift vs. Diffusion):** The total current in a semiconductor is the sum of drift current (due to the electric field) and diffusion current (due to carrier concentration gradients). The derivation of the Mott-Gurney equation considers only the drift current component and assumes that the **diffusion current is negligible**. This is a valid approximation when the applied voltage is sufficiently high, making the field-driven drift the dominant transport mechanism.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This statement is incorrect because SCLC is fundamentally a **drift current**. The drift current is not negligible; it *is* the current.\n\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because the model assumes a **single-carrier** device.\n\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement correctly combines all the key assumptions:\n    *   \"trap-free\": Correct.\n    *   \"single-carrier device\": Correct.\n    *   \"no carrier injection barrier\": Correct (this is the definition of a perfect Ohmic contact for SCLC).\n    *   \"negligible diffusion current\": Correct.\n\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because a **Schottky contact** would limit the injection of carriers, violating the core assumption of SCLC.\n\nTherefore, statement C provides the most accurate and complete description of the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
