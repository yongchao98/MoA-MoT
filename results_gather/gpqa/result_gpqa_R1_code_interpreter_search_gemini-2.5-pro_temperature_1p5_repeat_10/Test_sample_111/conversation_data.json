    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector\nThe given state `|α>` is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. Let's call the unnormalized state `|ψ>`.\n`|ψ> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`\n\nTo normalize it, we need to find its inner product with itself, `<ψ|ψ>`, and divide by its square root. The dual state `bra` is `<ψ| = (1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down|`.\n\nThe inner product is:\n`<ψ|ψ> = [(1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down|] * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n`<ψ|ψ> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)`\nUsing the formula `(a+bi)(a-bi) = a² + b²`:\n`<ψ|ψ> = (1² + 1²) + (2² + 1²) = (1 + 1) + (4 + 1) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant `N` is `1/sqrt(<ψ|ψ>)`, so `N = 1/√7`.\nThe normalized state `|α>` is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn matrix representation, where `|up> = [[1], [0]]` and `|down> = [[0], [1]]`, the state vector is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n\n### 2. Define the Operator A\nThe problem states that the operator A has matrix elements `Aij` where `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j` and `Aij = 0` if `i = j`. For a 2-state system (spin up/down), this is a 2x2 matrix:\n`A = [[A11, A12], [A21, A22]] = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]`\nWe can write this as `A = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`, which is `(hbar/2) * σ_x`, where `σ_x` is the Pauli-X matrix.\n\n### 3. Find the Eigenvalues and Eigenstates of A\nWe need to solve the eigenvalue equation `A|v> = λ|v>`.\nThe characteristic equation is `det(A - λI) = 0`.\n`det( [[-λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]] ) = (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues: `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   **For λ₁ = +hbar/2**:\n    `(hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [[a], [b]] = (hbar/2) * [[a], [b]]`\n    `[[b], [a]] = [[a], [b]]` => `a = b`.\n    The eigenvector is proportional to `[[1], [1]]`. Normalizing it gives:\n    `|v₁> = (1/sqrt(1²+1²)) * [[1], [1]] = (1/√2) * [[1], [1]]`\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -hbar/2**:\n    `(hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [[a], [b]] = -(hbar/2) * [[a], [b]]`\n    `[[b], [a]] = -[[a], [b]]` => `b = -a`.\n    The eigenvector is proportional to `[[1], [-1]]`. Normalizing it gives:\n    `|v₂> = (1/sqrt(1²+(-1)²)) * [[1], [-1]] = (1/√2) * [[1], [-1]]`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Measurement Probabilities\nThe probability `P(λi)` of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|vi>` is given by the formula `P(λi) = |<vi|α>|²`.\n\n*   **Probability for λ₁ = +hbar/2 (state |v₁>):**\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/√2) * [1, 1] * (1/√7) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)]`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14`\n    `P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   **Probability for λ₂ = -hbar/2 (state |v₂>):**\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/√2) * [1, -1] * (1/√7) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)]`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14`\n    `P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately **0.64** and **0.36**. As a check, `9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1`.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Average Value of A\nThe average value (or expectation value) `<A>` can be calculated in two ways.\n1.  `<A> = Σ P(λi) * λi`\n2.  `<A> = <α|A|α>`\n\nUsing the first method is simpler now that we have the probabilities and eigenvalues:\n`<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂`\n`<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (4/14) = (hbar/2) * (2/7)`\n`<A> = hbar / 7`\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is `hbar / 7`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
