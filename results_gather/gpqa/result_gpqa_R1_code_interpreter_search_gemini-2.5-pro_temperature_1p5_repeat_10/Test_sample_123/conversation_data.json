    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand Particle Decay:** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial number `N₀` after a time `t` is described by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)`, where `T` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the frame of reference where time `t` is measured.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The particle has a proper mean lifetime, `τ`, which is its lifetime in its own rest frame. For an observer in the lab frame (the detector's frame), this lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. The dilated lifetime, `T_lab`, is given by `T_lab = γ * τ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Survival Probability:** A particle created at the center of the detector travels a distance `L` (the radius of the detector) to reach the inner wall. The time taken for this travel in the lab frame is `t_lab = L / v`, where `v` is the particle's velocity. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`, so we can approximate `t_lab ≈ L / c`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Equation:** The fraction of particles that survive the journey to the detector wall is `N/N₀`. We can substitute the expressions for `t_lab` and `T_lab` into the decay law:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / T_lab) = exp(-(L/c) / (γ * τ))`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-L / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n5.  **Analyze the Given Scenarios:** The problem provides two scenarios. The quantity `L / (c * τ)` is a constant value for this specific particle and experimental setup, as `L` (detector radius), `c` (speed of light), and `τ` (proper lifetime) do not change.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Fraction of survivors, `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n        *   The equation is: `1/3 = exp(-L / (20 * c * τ))`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Fraction of survivors, `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₂` is unknown.\n        *   The equation is: `2/3 = exp(-L / (γ₂ * c * τ))`\n\n6.  **Solve for `γ₂`:** We can solve this system of two equations. First, let's take the natural logarithm of both equations to eliminate the exponential function.\n\n    *   From Scenario 1:\n        `ln(1/3) = -L / (20 * c * τ)`\n        `-ln(3) = -L / (20 * c * τ)`\n        `ln(3) = L / (20 * c * τ)`\n        Let's isolate the constant term `L / (c * τ)`:\n        `L / (c * τ) = 20 * ln(3)`  (Equation A)\n\n    *   From Scenario 2:\n        `ln(2/3) = -L / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n        `-ln(3/2) = -L / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n        `ln(3/2) = L / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n        Isolating the same constant term:\n        `L / (c * τ) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`  (Equation B)\n\n7.  **Equate and Calculate:** Since both Equation A and Equation B are equal to `L / (c * τ)`, we can set them equal to each other:\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Now, we solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value for gamma_2 based on the derived formula\n# gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_output>\n54.18958983196924\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculation shows that `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value `54.19` is extremely close to the value given in option D.\n    A) 40\n    B) 68\n    C) 28\n    D) 54\n\nTherefore, the correct Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem involves the relativistic effect of time dilation on decaying particles.\n\n1.  **Particle Decay and Time Dilation:**\n    The fraction of particles `N/N₀` that survive after a time `t` in a given reference frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-t / T_lab)`\n    Where `T_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle as measured in the laboratory frame. This lab-frame lifetime is dilated from the particle's proper lifetime (`τ`) due to its high velocity, according to the formula:\n    `T_lab = γ * τ`\n    Here, `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n2.  **Time of Flight:**\n    The particles travel from the center of the spherical detector to its inner wall, a distance `L` equal to the radius (30 meters). Since they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities (`v ≈ c`), the time of flight in the lab frame is:\n    `t ≈ L / c`\n\n3.  **Survival Equation:**\n    Substituting the expressions for `t` and `T_lab` into the decay law, we get the survival fraction:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(L/c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-L / (γ * c * τ))`\n    The term `L / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup.\n\n4.  **Applying the Two Scenarios:**\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:** A fraction of `1/3` of the particles survives when the Lorentz factor is `γ₁ = 20`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-L / (20 * c * τ))`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:** We want to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which `2/3` of the particles survive.\n        `2/3 = exp(-L / (γ₂ * c * τ))`\n\n5.  **Solving for `γ₂`:**\n    We can solve this system of equations by first taking the natural logarithm of both equations to eliminate the exponential term.\n\n    From Scenario 1:\n    `ln(1/3) = -L / (20 * c * τ)`\n    `-ln(3) = -L / (20 * c * τ)`\n    `ln(3) = L / (20 * c * τ)`\n    Let's find the value of the constant `L/(c*τ)`:\n    `L / (c * τ) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    From Scenario 2:\n    `ln(2/3) = -L / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -L / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n    `ln(3/2) = L / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\n    Now, we can substitute the expression for `L/(c*τ)` from the first scenario into the second one:\n    `ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n    Finally, we solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis calculated value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<D>>>"
