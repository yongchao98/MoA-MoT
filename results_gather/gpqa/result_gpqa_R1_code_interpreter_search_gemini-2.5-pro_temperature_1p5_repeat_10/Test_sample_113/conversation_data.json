    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n    1.  **Identify the reaction:** This is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one).\n    2.  **Reactants:**\n        *   Butan-2-one (CH₃-CO-CH₂-CH₃) is the ketone substrate.\n        *   NaCN (sodium cyanide) provides the nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻).\n    3.  **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic CN⁻ attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    4.  **Role of Reagent A:** This alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the final product, a hydroxyl group (-OH). This requires a source of protons (H⁺). An acidic workup, represented by H₃O⁺, provides the necessary protons. The overall reaction is the addition of HCN across the C=O bond. Using NaCN requires a subsequent or concurrent source of protons.\n    5.  **Evaluating the options for A:**\n        *   H₃O⁺: Represents an acid source (like aqueous HCl or H₂SO₄), which is required to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. This is a suitable choice.\n        *   NaHSO₃: Sodium bisulfite is another nucleophile that adds to ketones, but it would form a different product (a bisulfite addition product), not a cyanohydrin.\n    6.  **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be H₃O⁺.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n    1.  **Identify the reaction:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    2.  **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires harsh conditions, typically heating with a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄). The nitrile is protonated, water attacks, and after several steps, the carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion are formed.\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous base (like NaOH). This initially forms a carboxylate salt (R-COO⁻) and ammonia. An acidic workup is then required to protonate the carboxylate to get the final carboxylic acid (R-COOH).\n    3.  **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis in water. The product is a carboxylic acid.\n    4.  **Evaluating the options for B:**\n        *   HCl: A strong acid, which is a standard reagent for the direct hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n        *   CH₃COOH: Acetic acid is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid under typical conditions.\n    5.  **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B must be a strong acid like HCl.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   This combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
