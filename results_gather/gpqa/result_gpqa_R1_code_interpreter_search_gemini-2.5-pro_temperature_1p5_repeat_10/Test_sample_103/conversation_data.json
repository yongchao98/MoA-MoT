    "This problem requires us to relate the observed periodic wavelength shift of a star to the orbital period of a planet orbiting it.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift of light from a star. The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along the line of sight. The maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$) corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n    $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$\n    For the two systems, we can write the ratio of their radial velocity amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Amplitude ($K$):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the amplitude of the host star's radial velocity is given by:\n    $K = \\frac{2\\pi a_s \\sin(i)}{T}$\n    where:\n    *   $T$ is the orbital period (same for the planet and the star).\n    *   $a_s$ is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the system's barycenter.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight ($i=90^\\circ$ for an edge-on system).\n\n3.  **Barycenter Relation:** The star and planet orbit a common center of mass. Their distances to the barycenter ($a_s$ for the star, $a_p$ for the planet) are related to their masses ($M_s$ for the star, $m_p$ for the planet) by:\n    $M_s a_s = m_p a_p$\n    The semi-major axis of the planet's orbit around the star is $a = a_s + a_p$. Since exoplanets are much less massive than their host stars ($m_p \\ll M_s$), the barycenter is very close to the star's center, and we can approximate the planet's orbital semi-major axis as $a \\approx a_p$.\n    This gives us $a_s \\approx \\frac{m_p}{M_s} a$.\n\n4.  **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law connects the orbital period ($T$) and the semi-major axis ($a$) of the planet:\n    $T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_s + m_p)} a^3$\n    Again, since $m_p \\ll M_s$, we can simplify this to:\n    $T^2 \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M_s} a^3$\n    From this, we can express $a$ in terms of $T$ and $M_s$:\n    $a \\propto (M_s T^2)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Combining the Equations:** Now, we substitute the expressions for $a_s$ and $a$ into the formula for $K$:\n    *   $K \\propto \\frac{a_s}{T}$ (assuming inclination $i$ is the same for both systems, which is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise).\n    *   $a_s \\propto \\frac{m_p}{M_s} a$\n    *   $a \\propto (M_s T^2)^{1/3}$\n\n    Combining these proportionalities:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{T} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{m_p}{M_s}\\right) \\cdot (M_s T^2)^{1/3}$\n    $K \\propto \\frac{m_p}{M_s} \\cdot \\frac{M_s^{1/3} T^{2/3}}{T}$\n    $K \\propto \\frac{m_p}{M_s^{2/3}} T^{-1/3}$\n\n6.  **Solving for the Period Ratio:** The problem states that the stars have the same mass ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$) and the planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$). Therefore, the terms involving mass are constant for both systems. The relation simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n    We can write this as a ratio for our two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    Now, we substitute the known ratio of the K-amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides:\n    $\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n    $\\frac{343}{125} = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, which is $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. We take the reciprocal:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    ```python\n    # Calculate the numerical value of the ratio T2/T1.\n    ratio = 125 / 343\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n    <execute_code>\n    <<<\n    >>>\n    0.3644314868804665\n    >>>\n    <<<\n    The calculated ratio is approximately 0.364. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
