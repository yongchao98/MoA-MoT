    "*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for what should be a single proton (an alpha-proton). The peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals sum to the expected value of 1H, with a roughly 1:1 ratio. Spin-spin coupling has been ruled out. This strongly suggests that the proton exists in two different, but structurally similar, chemical environments. The two species are present in roughly equal amounts and are stable enough on the NMR timescale (i.e., they do not interconvert rapidly) to be observed as separate signals.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The LC-MS analysis confirms the presence of two distinct chemical species, as they separate into two peaks on the liquid chromatography (LC) column. The fact that they separate even at elevated temperature indicates a significant energy barrier to interconversion. The mass spectrometry (MS) data is crucial: both peaks give the exact same mass spectrum, which corresponds to the expected molecule. This tells us two things:\n    1.  The two species are **isomers** (same chemical formula, same mass).\n    2.  The observations are not due to a contaminant like a precursor or a side product from an incomplete reaction, as those would almost certainly have different masses.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **D) Contaminated with a precursor:** This is ruled out by the MS data, as a precursor would have a different molecular weight.\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This implies a side reaction where, for example, two amino acids were added where only one was intended. This would result in a product with a higher mass and is therefore ruled out by the MS data.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. A standard ¹H NMR experiment is achiral, so a mixture of enantiomers would produce a single set of peaks, indistinguishable from a pure enantiomer. Similarly, standard LC (with an achiral column) would not separate enantiomers; they would elute as a single peak. Therefore, this option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties. Because they are chemically distinct, they would give different signals in an NMR spectrum. An alpha-proton in one diastereoisomer would be in a different chemical environment from the same proton in the other diastereoisomer, leading to two separate peaks. Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography. This explanation perfectly fits all the observations: two NMR peaks, two LC peaks, and the same mass. A common cause of this phenomenon in peptides is cis/trans isomerism of the amide bond preceding a proline residue. These cis/trans isomers are a type of diastereomer (or more specifically, rotamers with a high barrier to interconversion) and are well-known to cause peak doubling in NMR and can often be separated by LC. Another possibility is epimerization at one of the chiral centers during synthesis, which would also produce a diastereomer.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of two separable isomers of the same mass that give distinct NMR signals points unequivocally to a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
