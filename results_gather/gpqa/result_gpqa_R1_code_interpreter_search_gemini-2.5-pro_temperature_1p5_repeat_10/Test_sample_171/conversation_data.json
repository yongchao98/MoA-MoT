    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct equation:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. Since the stars are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we can use the Boltzmann equation to relate the number of atoms in different energy states to the temperature.\n\n2.  **Write Down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms `N_j` in an excited state `j` to the number of atoms `N_i` in a lower state `i`:\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k_B * T))`\n    Where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the levels (which we can assume are constant for the specific transition in the iron atom).\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the Equation to Both Stars:** Let's define the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state population as `R = N_excited / N_ground`. We can write this for each star:\n    *   For star_1 with temperature `T_1`:\n        `R_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1))`\n        (Here, `C` represents the constant ratio of statistical weights, `g_j / g_i`).\n    *   For star_2 with temperature `T_2`:\n        `R_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2))`\n\n4.  **Use the Information from the Problem:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This means the ratio `R` for star_1 is twice the ratio `R` for star_2.\n    `R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\n5.  **Set Up the Equation:** Substitute the expressions for `R_1` and `R_2` into this relationship:\n    `C * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)) = 2 * [ C * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2)) ]`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Equation:**\n    *   The constant `C` (the ratio of statistical weights) cancels out from both sides:\n        `exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2))`\n    *   To solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        `ln[exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2))]`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n        `-ΔE / (k_B * T_1) = ln(2) + [-ΔE / (k_B * T_2)]`\n    *   Rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n        `ΔE / (k_B * T_2) - ΔE / (k_B * T_1) = ln(2)`\n    *   Factor out the common term `ΔE / k_B`:\n        `(ΔE / k_B) * [1/T_2 - 1/T_1] = ln(2)`\n\n7.  **Incorporate the Given Values:** The problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. We know the Boltzmann constant is `k_B ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`. Let's calculate the ratio:\n    `ΔE / k_B ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n    The problem is set up so that this pre-factor is equal to 1.\n\n8.  **Finalize the Equation:** Substitute `ΔE / k_B = 1` back into our equation:\n    `1 * [1/T_2 - 1/T_1] = ln(2)`\n    *   Combine the fractions inside the brackets:\n        `(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) = ln(2)`\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** This final derived equation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
