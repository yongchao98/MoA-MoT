    "I need to determine which stars from the list are observable by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory.\n\nFirst, let's establish the criteria for a star to be observable by both instruments.\n\n**1. Location (Declination):**\nA star must be visible from both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\n*   The Paranal Observatory is in Chile, at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South.\n*   The W. M. Keck Observatory is in Hawaii, at a latitude of approximately 19.8° North.\nDisregarding specific pointing limits means we consider a star visible if it ever rises above the horizon.\n*   For Keck (Lat ~ +20°), the observable declination (DEC) is `DEC > Lat - 90°`, so `DEC > -70°`.\n*   For Paranal (Lat ~ -25°), the observable declination is `DEC < Lat + 90°`, so `DEC < +65°`.\nTherefore, for a star to be visible from both locations, its declination must be in the range: **-70° < DEC < +65°**.\n\n**2. Brightness (Apparent Magnitude):**\nA star must be bright enough for both spectrographs. The limits are:\n*   ESPRESSO: apparent V magnitude (m_V) < 17\n*   HIRES: apparent V magnitude (m_V) < 16\nThe stricter limit is from HIRES. Therefore, for a star to be observable by both, its apparent magnitude must be **m_V < 16**.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each star against these two criteria. I will use the formula relating apparent magnitude (m_V), absolute magnitude (M_V), distance (d), and interstellar absorption (A_V):\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10 pc) + A_V`\nwhere `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n---\n### Star by Star Analysis\n\n**Star 1**\n*   **Location:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the required range (-70° < DEC < +65°), as it is too far south to be seen from Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 2**\n*   **Location:** DEC = +55°. This is within the required range (-70° < DEC < +65°).\n*   **Brightness:** The apparent V magnitude is given as m_V = 16.5 mag. This does not satisfy the brightness criterion of m_V < 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 3**\n*   **Location:** DEC = +48°. This is within the required range (-70° < DEC < +65°).\n*   **Brightness:** The problem states \"apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag\". Apparent magnitude is the brightness as observed from Earth, which already includes the effects of distance and absorption. Since m_V = 15.5 mag, it satisfies the brightness criterion of m_V < 16. The extra information about E(B-V) does not alter the given apparent magnitude.\n*   **Conclusion:** Observable by both.\n\n**Star 4**\n*   **Location:** DEC = -48°. This is within the required range (-70° < DEC < +65°).\n*   **Brightness:** We need to calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   M_V = 15.5 mag\n    *   d = 10 pc\n    *   A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n    *   This does not satisfy the brightness criterion of m_V < 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 5**\n*   **Location:** DEC = +60°. This is within the required range (-70° < DEC < +65°).\n*   **Brightness:** We need to calculate the apparent magnitude. No absorption is mentioned, so A_V = 0.\n    *   M_V = 16.5 mag\n    *   d = 5 pc\n    *   m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 * log10(0.5) = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag.\n    *   m_V ≈ 15.0 mag. This satisfies the brightness criterion of m_V < 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** Observable by both.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Star 1: No (Location)\n*   Star 2: No (Brightness)\n*   **Star 3: Yes**\n*   Star 4: No (Brightness)\n*   **Star 5: Yes**\n\nThe stars that can be detected with both spectrographs are Star3 and Star5. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
