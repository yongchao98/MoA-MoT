    "*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n    1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet (s) integrating to 3 protons in this region (~2.0-2.2 ppm) is highly characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (CH₃-COO-). All four options contain an acetate group, so this is consistent.\n\n    2.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet (d) integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (CH₃-) that is coupled to a single adjacent proton (-CH-). This points towards a CH₃-CH= structure.\n\n    3.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:** These signals are in the vinylic region (5-8 ppm), indicating protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n        *   The signal at **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)** is for a single proton. The multiplicity, a doublet of quartets (dq), means it is coupled to two different sets of protons: one single proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This fits perfectly with a proton on a double bond that is adjacent to another vinylic proton and a methyl group: `CH₃-CH=`. This proton is the one at the `-CH=` part.\n        *   The signal at **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)** is for the other single vinylic proton. It is a doublet, meaning it's coupled to only one other proton (the one at 5.5 ppm). The high chemical shift (7.0 ppm) is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom from the acetate group (`=CH-O-`).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Putting the pieces together: we have an acetate group (CH₃COO-), and a `CH₃-CH=CH-` group. This forms a propenyl acetate structure: `CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    This eliminates the butenyl acetate options (C and D), as their fragmentation patterns would be different and they would have 10 protons, not 8 as indicated by the integration (3+3+1+1=8).\n\n*   **Determining Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n    The key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J value) between the two vinylic protons (the ones at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm).\n    *   **Trans coupling (³J_trans):** Protons on opposite sides of the double bond typically have a large coupling constant, usually in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis coupling (³J_cis):** Protons on the same side of the double bond typically have a smaller coupling constant, usually in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    The provided J value for the doublet at 7.0 ppm is **16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the typical range for a trans configuration.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data (proton count, chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and coupling constant) is fully consistent with the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
