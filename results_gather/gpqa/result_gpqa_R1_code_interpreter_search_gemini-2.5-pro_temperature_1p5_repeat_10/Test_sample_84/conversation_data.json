Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which can be expressed as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. The Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet orbiting a star is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from the star and the energy it radiates away. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_eff_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   `T_eff_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n**3. Form the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nWe need to calculate the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_eff_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂), and they orbit the same star (so T_eff_star and R_star are the same for both). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a₁)) * (2 * a₂ / R_star))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the square root of the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**4. Relate Observational Data to the Semi-Major Axis**\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) for each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (its wobble), known as the RV amplitude (K), by the formula:\nΔλ / λ₀ = K / c  =>  K = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe RV amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit viewed edge-on (inclination i ≈ 90°, which is a valid assumption since transits are detected) is given by:\nK = M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))\nwhere:\n*   `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n*   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\nK² = M_p² * (G / (a * M_star))\na = (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star)\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\nNow we can form the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (K₂² * M_star)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (K₁² * M_star)]\n\nThe terms `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**6. Calculate the Individual Ratios**\n*   **Ratio of Planet Masses (M_p₂ / M_p₁):**\n    M_p₁ = 7 Earth masses\n    M_p₂ = 5 Earth masses\n    M_p₂ / M_p₁ = 5 / 7\n\n*   **Ratio of RV Amplitudes (K₁ / K₂):**\n    Since K is directly proportional to Δλ (K = c * Δλ / λ₀), the ratio K₁ / K₂ is equal to the ratio Δλ₁ / Δλ₂.\n    Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**7. Substitute the Ratios and Calculate a₂ / a₁**\na₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n**8. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\nNow, substitute this back into our temperature ratio formula:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784) = 15 / 28\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Data ---\n# Planet 1\nMp1 = 7.0  # Earth masses\nd_lambda1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\n\n# Planet 2\nMp2 = 5.0  # Earth masses\nd_lambda2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes (K) is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n# K1 / K2 = d_lambda1 / d_lambda2\nratio_K = d_lambda1 / d_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of the planet masses.\n# Mp2 / Mp1\nratio_Mp = Mp2 / Mp1\n\n# The ratio of the semi-major axes 'a' is given by:\n# a2 / a1 = (Mp2 / Mp1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\nratio_a = (ratio_Mp**2) * (ratio_K**2)\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the square root of the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n# Teq1 / Teq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nratio_Teq = math.sqrt(ratio_a)\n\nprint(f\"{ratio_Teq:.4f}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
