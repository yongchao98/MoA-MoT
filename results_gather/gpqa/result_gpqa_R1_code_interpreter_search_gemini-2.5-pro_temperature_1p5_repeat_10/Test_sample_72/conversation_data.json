    "This problem requires us to calculate two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds: their relative speed and the total energy of the system.\n\n**1. Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThe two astronauts are moving in the same direction (positive x-direction) in a given reference frame.\n-   Velocity of the first astronaut, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n-   Velocity of the second astronaut, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nTo find the speed of the first astronaut relative to the second, we use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for relative velocity:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts. The total energy of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ and velocity $v$ is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n**For the first astronaut:**\n-   Rest mass, $m_{0,1} = 2m$\n-   Velocity, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n\nFirst, we calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$:\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\nNow, we calculate the energy of the first astronaut, $E_1$:\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_{0,1} c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**For the second astronaut:**\n-   Rest mass, $m_{0,2} = 3m$\n-   Velocity, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nFirst, we calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n\nNow, we calculate the energy of the second astronaut, $E_2$:\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_{0,2} c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}) \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy of the System:**\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated values are:\n-   Relative speed, $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n-   Total energy, $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThese values correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
