    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Verify the Molecular Formula**\n\nFirst, let's confirm that all the proposed compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Tetramethylbenzene (C6H2(CH3)4):** The benzene ring core is C6. Adding four methyl groups (CH3) and removing four hydrogens (H) results in C6H(6-4) + C4H(4*3) = C6H2 + C4H12 = **C10H14**. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, and 1,2,3,4-) fit this formula.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2):** The benzene ring core is C6. Adding two ethyl groups (C2H5) and removing two hydrogens (H) results in C6H(6-2) + C4H(2*5) = C6H4 + C4H10 = **C10H14**. This compound also fits the formula.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number and type of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric (para substitution).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons (at positions 2, 3, 5, 6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Within each ethyl group, the two methylene (-CH2-) protons are split by the three methyl (-CH3) protons, resulting in a **quartet** (4H total). The three methyl protons are split by the two methylene protons, resulting in a **triplet** (6H total).\n    *   *Conclusion:* Since the experimental spectrum shows only singlets in the alkyl region, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This rules out option D.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric (possesses a center of inversion and two mirror planes).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** (12H).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 2 singlets in total.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes pairs of protons and methyl groups equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H). (Although they are ortho-coupled, in such a symmetrical environment, they often appear as a singlet).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other, but different from the C1/C4 pair. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H (ratio 1:1).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 3 singlets in total.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to the C2 symmetry. This produces **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H). The methyl groups at C2 and C5 are unique and lie on the axis of symmetry, making them inequivalent to each other and to the other methyls. This results in **three singlets** with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 4 singlets in total.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Spectrum of the 1:1 Mixture**\n\nThe experimental spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n1.  **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n2.  **Alkyl Region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's test the remaining options (A, B, C).\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) produce a single 2H aromatic singlet. A 1:1 mixture of any two of these will result in two aromatic singlets (assuming different chemical shifts), each corresponding to 2H. The integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which simplifies to 1:1. Therefore, the aromatic region data is consistent with any combination of these three isomers.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region Check (The Deciding Factor):** We need to find a combination of alkyl signals that results in three singlets with a 2:1:1 relative integration. For a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio on an integral of 24 means the actual proton counts for the three signals must be:\n    *   Signal 1: (2 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n    So we are looking for a combination that produces three singlets with integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n    Let's combine the predicted alkyl signals for each pair:\n\n    *   **A) Prehnitene + Isodurene:**\n        *   Prehnitene: Two singlets (6H, 6H)\n        *   Isodurene: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n        *   Combined: This would give between 3 to 5 signals depending on overlaps, but the integrals (6, 6, 6, 3, 3) cannot be combined to give (12, 6, 6). So, this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) Durene + Isodurene:**\n        *   Durene: One singlet (12H)\n        *   Isodurene: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n        *   Combined: This gives four singlets with integrals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This is not three signals. So, this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) Durene + Prehnitene:**\n        *   Durene: **One singlet (12H)**\n        *   Prehnitene: **Two singlets (6H, 6H)**\n        *   Combined: This mixture gives exactly **three singlets** with integrals of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. This corresponds to the required 2:1:1 ratio. This is a perfect match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene).\n\n<<<C>>>"
