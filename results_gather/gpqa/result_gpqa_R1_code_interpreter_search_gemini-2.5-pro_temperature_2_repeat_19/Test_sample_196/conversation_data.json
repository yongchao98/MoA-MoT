  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the provided IR and ¹H NMR data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O bond stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of C=C bonds within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A very downfield, broad singlet for one proton is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a para (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   **Alkyl group analysis (0.9 to 2.9 ppm):**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to multiple different protons. It's next to the -CH₃ at 0.9 ppm and the -CH- at 2.9 ppm.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1H, in the benzylic region (attached to the aromatic ring), indicates a methine group (-CH-). It's coupled to the -CH₃ at 1.4 ppm and the -CH₂- at 1.7 ppm.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** Based on the coupling patterns, we can assemble the substituent: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n        *   **Conclusion from NMR:** The compound is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining the analyses, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option B.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (P) and hydriodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction:** This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to perform the complete reduction of several oxygen-containing functional groups, including carboxylic acids, to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically, a carboxylic acid (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Transformation:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, will undergo the reduction of its carboxylic acid group.\n        *   The **-COOH** group at position 1 will be converted to a **-CH₃** group.\n        *   The **sec-butyl** group at position 4 is already an alkyl group and will remain unchanged.\n    *   **Final Product:** The final product will be **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This is the structure we predicted as the final product.\n    *   B) **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:** This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   C) **2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid:** This is an incorrect structure.\n    *   D) **1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** This has an isobutyl group, not a sec-butyl group. The NMR data clearly distinguished the sec-butyl structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
