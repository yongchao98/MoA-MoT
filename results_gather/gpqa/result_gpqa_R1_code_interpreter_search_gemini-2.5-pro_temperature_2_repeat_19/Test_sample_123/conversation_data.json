    "*   **Initial Setup and Physical Principles**\n\n    1.  **Particle Decay:** The problem involves unstable particles that decay over time. The number of particles N(t) remaining at time t from an initial sample N₀ follows an exponential decay law: N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ_lab), where τ_lab is the mean lifetime of the particles in the laboratory frame.\n    2.  **Survival Probability:** The fraction of particles that survive after a time t is N(t)/N₀, which is the survival probability P(t) = exp(-t/τ_lab).\n    3.  **Time Dilation:** The particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds. Due to special relativity, their internal \"clocks\" run slower from the perspective of the lab observer. Their mean lifetime in the lab frame (τ_lab) is dilated compared to their lifetime in their own rest frame (τ₀). The relationship is given by τ_lab = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n    4.  **Travel Time:** The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center of the detector to its inner wall is t_travel = R/v. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity v is extremely close to the speed of light, c. Therefore, we can approximate the travel time as t_travel ≈ R/c.\n    5.  **Putting it Together:** The probability of a particle reaching the detector wall is the probability that it survives for the duration of its travel time.\n        P_survival = exp(-t_travel / τ_lab) = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))\n        Let's define a constant k = R / (c * τ₀). This constant combines the detector size and the intrinsic properties of the particle. The equation simplifies to:\n        P_survival = exp(-k / γ)\n\n*   **Step 1: Using the initial conditions to find the constant 'k'.**\n\n    We are given the following initial information:\n    *   Radius of the detector, R = 30 meters.\n    *   Initial Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20.\n    *   Fraction of particles reaching the detector (survival probability), P₁ = 1/3.\n\n    Plugging these values into our survival probability equation:\n    1/3 = exp(-k / 20)\n\n    To solve for k, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -k / 20\n    -ln(3) = -k / 20\n    k = 20 * ln(3)\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculating the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) for the desired survival probability.**\n\n    Now, we want to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂, that results in a survival probability of P₂ = 2/3. We use the same equation and the value of k we just found:\n    P₂ = exp(-k / γ₂)\n    2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)\n\n    Again, we take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for γ₂:\n    ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n    -ln(3/2) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n    ln(1.5) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to isolate γ₂:\n    γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\n\n*   **Step 3: Numerical Calculation**\n\n    To get the final numerical answer, we can compute the value of the expression.\n\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Calculate gamma_2 using the derived formula\n    # gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\n    gamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n    print(gamma_2)\n    ```\n\n    The calculation yields approximately 54.19. This value is extremely close to one of the multiple-choice options.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    The Lorentz factor needed to have about two-thirds of the particles reaching the detector inner walls is approximately 54.\n\n<<<D>>>"
