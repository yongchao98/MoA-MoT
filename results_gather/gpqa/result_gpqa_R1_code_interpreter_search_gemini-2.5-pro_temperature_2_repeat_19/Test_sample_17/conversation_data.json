    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Abundance Notation**\n\nThe notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of two elements, X and Y, in a star relative to the same ratio in the Sun. The formula is:\n\n`[X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y)_star - log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun`\n\nwhere:\n- `n_X` and `n_Y` are the number densities (number of atoms per unit volume) of elements X and Y.\n- The subscript \"star\" refers to the star in question (Star_1 or Star_2).\n- The subscript \"sun\" refers to our Sun.\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. This can be interpreted as the ratio of their silicon abundances relative to a common reference element, typically Hydrogen (H). We are looking for the value of:\n\n`Ratio = (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`\n\n### **2. Calculating the Silicon Abundance for Star_1**\n\nWe are given the following information for Star_1:\n- `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`\n- `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`\n\nWe can use the property of logarithmic abundances: `[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]`. Rearranging this gives `[A/H] = [A/B] + [B/H]`.\n\nLet's find the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio for Star_1, `[Si/H]_1`:\n`[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\nNow, let's convert this back to a linear ratio using the definition of `[X/Y]`:\n`[Si/H]_1 = log10(n_Si / n_H)_1 - log10(n_Si / n_H)_sun = 0.3`\n`log10(n_Si / n_H)_1 = 0.3 + log10(n_Si / n_H)_sun`\nTaking the antilog (10 to the power of each side):\n`(n_Si / n_H)_1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun`\n\n### **3. Calculating the Silicon Abundance for Star_2**\n\nWe are given the following information for Star_2:\n- `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`\n- `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`\n\nWe again use the property `[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]` to find `[Si/H]_2`.\nHere, A = Mg and B = Si.\n`[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2`\n`0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2`\n`[Si/H]_2 = -0.3`\n\nNow, let's convert this to a linear ratio:\n`[Si/H]_2 = log10(n_Si / n_H)_2 - log10(n_Si / n_H)_sun = -0.3`\n`log10(n_Si / n_H)_2 = -0.3 + log10(n_Si / n_H)_sun`\nTaking the antilog:\n`(n_Si / n_H)_2 = 10^-0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun`\n\n### **4. Calculating the Final Ratio**\n\nNow we can compute the ratio of the silicon abundances of the two stars:\n\n`Ratio = (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`\n`Ratio = [10^0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun] / [10^-0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun]`\n\nThe solar abundance term `(n_Si / n_H)_sun` cancels out:\n`Ratio = 10^0.3 / 10^-0.3`\n`Ratio = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3))`\n`Ratio = 10^0.6`\n\nTo get the numerical value, we can use a calculator. The other information given in the problem (stellar masses and the absolute solar abundances of Mg and Fe) is extraneous and not needed for this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the final ratio which is 10 to the power of 0.6\nratio = 10**0.6\nprint(ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 3.98. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~1.2\nB) ~3.9\nC) ~12.6\nD) ~0.8\n\nThe calculated value of ~3.98 is closest to 3.9.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Abundance Notation**\n\nThe notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element X to element Y in a star, compared to the same ratio in the Sun. The formula is:\n`[X/Y] = log10(N_X/N_Y)_star - log10(N_X/N_Y)_Sun`\n\nA key property derived from this is `[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]`. A special case is when C is Hydrogen (H):\n`[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]`\n\n**2. Determine the Silicon Abundance for Star 1 ([Si/H]₁) **\n\nWe are given for Star 1:\n- `[Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3`\n- `[Fe/H]₁ = 0.0`\n\nUsing the property `[A/H] = [A/B] + [B/H]`:\n`[Si/H]₁ = [Si/Fe]₁ + [Fe/H]₁`\n`[Si/H]₁ = 0.3 + 0.0 = 0.3`\n\n**3. Determine the Silicon Abundance for Star 2 ([Si/H]₂) **\n\nWe are given for Star 2:\n- `[Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3`\n- `[Mg/H]₂ = 0.0`\n\nUsing the property `[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]`:\n`[Mg/Si]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Si/H]₂`\n`0.3 = 0.0 - [Si/H]₂`\n`[Si/H]₂ = -0.3`\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms, which means the ratio of their abundances relative to Hydrogen: `(N_Si/N_H)₁ / (N_Si/N_H)₂`.\n\nLet's convert the logarithmic abundances (`[Si/H]`) back to linear ratios. From the definition:\n`[Si/H]₁ = log10(N_Si/N_H)₁ - log10(N_Si/N_H)_Sun = 0.3`\n`=> log10(N_Si/N_H)₁ = 0.3 + log10(N_Si/N_H)_Sun`\n`=> (N_Si/N_H)₁ = 10^0.3 * (N_Si/N_H)_Sun`\n\nAnd for Star 2:\n`[Si/H]₂ = log10(N_Si/N_H)₂ - log10(N_Si/N_H)_Sun = -0.3`\n`=> log10(N_Si/N_H)₂ = -0.3 + log10(N_Si/N_H)_Sun`\n`=> (N_Si/N_H)₂ = 10^-0.3 * (N_Si/N_H)_Sun`\n\nNow we can compute the final ratio:\n`Ratio = (N_Si/N_H)₁ / (N_Si/N_H)₂`\n`Ratio = (10^0.3 * (N_Si/N_H)_Sun) / (10^-0.3 * (N_Si/N_H)_Sun)`\n\nThe solar abundance term cancels out:\n`Ratio = 10^0.3 / 10^-0.3 = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) = 10^0.6`\n\nThe calculation gives:\n`10^0.6 ≈ 3.98`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. Note that the masses of the stars and the absolute abundances of Mg and Fe in the Sun are extra information not needed to solve the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>"
