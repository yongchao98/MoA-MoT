As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the phenotypes of the single mutants:**\n    *   Wild-type (control) has 100% resistance.\n    *   `g1` (G1 knockout): 75% resistance. This means gene G1 is responsible for about 25% of the plant's resistance.\n    *   `g2` (G2 knockout): 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function completely eliminates resistance. This indicates that G2 plays an essential, non-redundant role in the resistance pathway.\n    *   `g3` (G3 knockout): 50% resistance. This means gene G3 is responsible for about 50% of the plant's resistance.\n\n2.  **Analyze the phenotypes of the double mutants to understand gene interactions (epistasis):**\n    *   `g1g2`: 0% resistance. The phenotype of the double mutant is the same as the `g2` single mutant. When the phenotype of one mutation (g2) masks the phenotype of another mutation (g1), the masking gene (G2) is said to be **epistatic** to the masked gene (G1). This suggests that G2 acts downstream of G1, or more likely in this context, G2 is the central component of the pathway which G1 contributes to.\n    *   `g2g3`: 0% resistance. Similarly, the phenotype of the double mutant is the same as the `g2` single mutant. This means G2 is also **epistatic** to G3.\n    *   `g1g3`: 10% resistance. This phenotype is different from both `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%). If the effects of G1 and G3 were simply additive, we would expect a resistance of 100% - (loss from g1) - (loss from g3) = 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%. However, the observed resistance is only 10%. The loss of resistance in the double mutant (90%) is greater than the sum of the individual losses (25% + 50% = 75%). This synergistic interaction is a hallmark of **gene redundancy**, where two genes perform similar or parallel functions, and losing both has a much more severe effect than losing either one alone.\n\n3.  **Identify the transcription factor (TF):**\n    *   The problem states at least one gene is a TF acting upstream.\n    *   Gene G2's knockout results in a complete loss of function, and it is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This is the classic profile for a master regulator, such as a transcription factor that is required to turn on the entire resistance response (including potentially activating G1 and G3, among other genes).\n    *   G1 and G3 are less likely to be the primary TF, as their individual knockouts have partial effects. If G1 or G3 were the TF for the whole pathway, their knockout phenotype would be as severe as G2's.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the options based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: This is plausible and strongly supported.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. The experiment only measures one trait (resistance), so we cannot make a conclusion about pleiotropy.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This is false. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Plausible and strongly supported.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: This is correct. The synergistic effect of the `g1g3` double mutant points directly to redundancy.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: As noted before, this is false based on the standard definition of epistasis. However, the first two claims in this option are strongly supported by the data. Among all options, this one contains the most correct information derived directly from the experimental results. It's likely that this third clause is an error in the question.\n\n    *   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Unlikely. Its phenotype is the mildest.\n        *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: This part is true. However, the initial premise about G1 is weak.\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Plausible and strongly supported.\n        *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a specific molecular mechanism that could explain redundancy, but it cannot be concluded from this genetic data alone.\n        *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: This is false. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption B provides the most accurate description of the gene functions and interactions. The conclusions that \"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" are the strongest and most direct interpretations of the provided data. Despite the inaccuracy of the final clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\"), this option is the best fit overall.\n\n<<<B>>>"
