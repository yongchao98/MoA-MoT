    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the gas treatment process to identify the products of the decomposition.**\n    1.  The mixture of gases is first passed through a tube with anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂, which is a strong desiccant that absorbs water. The mass of this tube increased by 3.60 g. This means the mass of water (H₂O) produced is 3.60 g.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n    2.  Next, the remaining gases are passed through a Ca(OH)₂ solution. This solution absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The mass of this tube did not change, which implies that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition of the salts.\n\n    3.  Then, the gases are passed through a tube with red-hot copper. Copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g. This increase is equal to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n        *   The gas must have been O₂. Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol atoms / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n    4.  Finally, 2.24 liters of a remaining gas C were collected at standard temperature and pressure (STP). At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n        *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the identity of Gas C and the total composition of the gas mixture.**\n    *   The total mass of the initial salts was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Total Mass = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   7.20 g = 4.40 g + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   We can now find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass(Gas C) = Mass(Gas C) / Moles(Gas C) = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is unreactive towards Ca(OH)₂ and hot copper is most certainly Nitrogen (N₂).\n\n*   **Step 3: Summarize the decomposition products.**\n    *   H₂O: 0.2 mol\n    *   O₂: 0.025 mol\n    *   N₂: 0.1 mol\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the salts A and B.**\n    *   The products are H₂O, N₂, and O₂. This indicates the salts are composed of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. Since they are salts that decompose upon heating, ammonium salts of oxyanions are likely candidates.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that the salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n        *   Decomposition of ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n        *   Decomposition of ammonium nitrate (strong heating): 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n    *   The mixture of salts A and B is equimolar. Let 'n' be the moles of each salt.\n        *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01 + 4*1.01 + 14.01 + 2*16.00 = 64.04 g/mol.\n        *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01 + 4*1.01 + 14.01 + 3*16.00 = 80.05 g/mol.\n    *   The total mass of the mixture is 7.20 g:\n        *   n * M(NH₄NO₂) + n * M(NH₄NO₃) = 7.20 g\n        *   n * (64.04 + 80.05) = 7.20 g\n        *   n * (144.09) = 7.20 g\n        *   n = 7.20 / 144.09 ≈ 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, we have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃. Let's see if this produces the correct amount of gas.\n        *   From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂:\n            *   N₂ produced = 0.05 mol\n            *   H₂O produced = 2 * 0.05 mol = 0.1 mol\n        *   From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃:\n            *   Using the 2:2:1:4 ratio for the reaction 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O:\n            *   N₂ produced = (2/2) * 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n            *   O₂ produced = (1/2) * 0.05 mol = 0.025 mol\n            *   H₂O produced = (4/2) * 0.05 mol = 0.1 mol\n    *   Total products:\n        *   Total N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.1 mol. (Matches our finding)\n        *   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol. (Matches our finding)\n        *   Total H₂O = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol. (Matches our finding)\n    *   The hypothesis is correct. The salts A and B are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n    *   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>"
