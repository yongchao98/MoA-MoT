    "**1. Deconstruct the Product from NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the provided NMR spectra of the product to determine its structure.\n\n*   **Product Molecular Formula:** The reaction is an isomerization of compound X (C11H12O). Therefore, the product also has the formula C11H12O.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** For C11H12O, DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6. This high DoU suggests the presence of at least one aromatic ring.\n\n**13C NMR Analysis:**\n*   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically a ketone, likely conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. This accounts for one DoU.\n*   **δ 21.3 and δ 28.4 (1C each, s):** These are aliphatic carbons. Given they are associated with 3H singlets in the 1H NMR, they must be methyl groups attached to quaternary carbons (or non-protonated carbons like a carbonyl). δ 21.3 is typical for a methyl group attached to a benzene ring (like in toluene), and δ 28.4 is plausible for an acetyl methyl group (-CO-CH3) in a conjugated system.\n*   **Aromatic/Alkene Region (δ 126-145):** There are 6 signals corresponding to 8 carbons in this region: δ 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C). This region accounts for the remaining 5 DoU (e.g., a benzene ring = 4 DoU, plus a C=C bond = 1 DoU).\n\n**1H NMR Analysis:**\n*   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s):** These are two methyl groups that are singlets, meaning they are not adjacent to any protons. This supports the assignment of one as an acetyl methyl (`-CO-CH3`) and the other as a methyl group on an aromatic ring (`Ar-CH3`).\n*   **Aromatic/Alkene Region (δ 6.75-7.71):** This region contains 6 protons in total.\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d):** These two doublets, each integrating to one proton, are characteristic of two protons on a disubstituted double bond (`-CH=CH-`) that are coupled to each other.\n\n**Assembling the Product Structure:**\nBased on the fragments identified from the NMR data, we can assemble the product structure:\n1.  A ketone group: `-C(=O)-`\n2.  A *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n3.  A disubstituted double bond: `-CH=CH-`\n4.  Two methyl groups, existing as singlets.\n\nTo satisfy the singlet nature of the two methyls, one must be on the aromatic ring, making it a *p*-tolyl group (`p-CH3-C6H4-`), and the other must be part of an acetyl group (`-CO-CH3`). The remaining `-CH=CH-` fragment must link the *p*-tolyl group and the acetyl group. This leads to only one plausible structure:\n\n**Product:** (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one (also known as p-methylbenzalacetone)\n`CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`\n\nThis structure has the formula C11H12O and perfectly matches all the structural features deduced from the NMR spectra. (Note: \"Theoretical\" NMR values may differ slightly from standard experimental values, but the pattern of signals is the key).\n\n**2. Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization of X to the product, catalyzed by DABCO (a non-nucleophilic base) at high temperature. This suggests a base-catalyzed rearrangement. Let's examine how each option could rearrange. The starting materials are all vinyl oxiranes (allylic epoxides), which are known to rearrange to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. A common pathway is base-catalyzed elimination to form an allylic alcohol, which then tautomerizes to the more stable ketone.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** `Ph-CH=C(CH3)-[epoxide]`. Rearrangement of this would likely lead to `4-phenyl-3-methylbut-3-en-2-one`. This product would have only one vinyl proton (a singlet), which contradicts the product NMR data (showing two vinyl protons as doublets).\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** `p-tolyl-CH=CH-[epoxide]`. Specifically, `p-tolyl-CH=CH-CH-O-CH2`.\n    A plausible mechanism is the base (DABCO) abstracting an acidic proton from the carbon of the epoxide ring that is alpha to the vinyl group. This initiates an elimination reaction to form an enol, which tautomerizes to a ketone.\n    `p-tolyl-CH=CH-CH-O-CH2` --(base)--> `p-tolyl-CH=CH-C(OH)=CH2` (enol) --(tautomerization)--> `p-tolyl-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3` (ketone).\n    This process directly yields the product structure we identified from the NMR data.\n*   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** `Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)-CH(CH3)`. Rearrangement of this would lead to a product like `1-phenylpent-1-en-3-one` (`Ph-CH=CH-CO-CH2CH3`) or `4-phenylpent-3-en-2-one` (`Ph-CH2-CH=C(CH3)COCH3`). Neither of these has two methyl singlets. For example, `1-phenylpent-1-en-3-one` has no methyl singlets at all (it has a triplet and a quartet for the ethyl group). So this is incorrect.\n*   **D) 2-styrylepoxide:** This is commonly `2-phenylethenyl-oxirane`. Its formula is C10H10O, which does not match the given formula of C11H12O for compound X.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly starting material B, **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**, rearranges under the given conditions to form the product, **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**, whose structure is consistent with the provided 1H and 13C NMR spectra.\n\n<<<B>>>"
