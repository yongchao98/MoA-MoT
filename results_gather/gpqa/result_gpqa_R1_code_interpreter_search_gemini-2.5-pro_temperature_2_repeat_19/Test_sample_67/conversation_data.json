    "An analytical step-by-step derivation of the solution is provided below.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The system is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin angular momentum is represented by the operator `S`.\n    *   The magnetic moment `μ` is proportional to the spin: `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The problem defines the magnetic moment's z-component as `mu = γ*Sz`, implying we should focus on the spin operator `S`.\n    *   Initially, there's a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction, `B_initial = B k̂`.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state.\n    *   The Hamiltonian for this initial configuration is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B_initial = - (γS) ⋅ (B k̂) = -γB S_z`.\n    *   The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   The lowest energy state is `E_up`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z⟩`.\n    *   Therefore, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **Understand the Dynamics (t > 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction: `B_new = B ĵ`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B_new = - (γS) ⋅ (B ĵ) = -γB S_y`.\n    *   The state of the system will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`.\n    *   `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n    *   The problem is thus reduced to finding the expectation value `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩` and identifying its oscillation frequency.\n\n4.  **Method 1: Direct Calculation using Matrix Mechanics**\n    *   In the `S_z` basis, `|+z⟩ = [[1], [0]]` and `S_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    *   The spin-y operator is `S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   The Hamiltonian is `H = -γB S_y = -γB(ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   The time evolution operator `U(t) = e^(-iHt/ħ)` is:\n        `U(t) = exp[-i(-γB(ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]])t/ħ]`\n        `U(t) = exp[i(γBt/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]]`\n    *   Let `θ = γBt/2`. The expression is `exp[iθ * σ_y]`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli-Y matrix. Using the identity `exp[ia * σ_k] = cos(a)I + i sin(a)σ_k`:\n        `U(t) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)σ_y = cos(θ)[[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(θ)[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n        `U(t) = [[cos(θ), sin(θ)], [-sin(θ), cos(θ)]]`\n    *   Now, we find the state `|ψ(t)⟩`:\n        `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩ = [[cos(θ), sin(θ)], [-sin(θ), cos(θ)]] * [[1], [0]] = [[cos(θ)], [-sin(θ)]]`\n    *   Next, we calculate `⟨S_z(t)⟩`:\n        `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`\n        `⟨ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose: `[cos(θ), -sin(θ)]`\n        `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = [cos(θ), -sin(θ)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(θ)], [-sin(θ)]]`\n        `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos(θ), -sin(θ)] * [[cos(θ)], [sin(θ)]]`\n        `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * (cos²(θ) - sin²(θ))`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n        `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(2θ)`\n    *   Substitute `θ = γBt/2` back in:\n        `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   Finally, the expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component is:\n        `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   This is an oscillation of the form `A cos(ωt)`. By comparison, the angular frequency of oscillation `ω` is `γB`.\n\n5.  **Method 2: Larmor Precession (Conceptual approach)**\n    *   The time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` in a magnetic field `B` is given by the torque equation `d⟨S⟩/dt = ⟨μ⟩ × B`.\n    *   Since `⟨μ⟩ = γ⟨S⟩`, we have `d⟨S⟩/dt = γ⟨S⟩ × B`.\n    *   This equation describes the precession of the vector `⟨S⟩` around the magnetic field vector `B` at an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n    *   The angular velocity vector of precession is `ω = -γB`. The frequency (magnitude) is `ω_L = |γB|`.\n    *   In our case, for `t>0`, the magnetic field `B` is along the Y-axis. The initial spin `⟨S⟩` is along the Z-axis.\n    *   Therefore, the spin vector `⟨S⟩` will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane.\n    *   The z-component `⟨S_z(t)⟩` will vary sinusoidally as the projection of the precessing vector onto the Z-axis. The frequency of this variation is the Larmor frequency.\n    *   `ω = γB`.\n    *   This confirms the result from the detailed calculation. The oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    Both methods consistently show that the expectation value `⟨μ_z(t)⟩` oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\n    A) γB/√2\n    B) γB\n    C) γB/2\n    D) √2γB\n\n    The correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
