    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Starting Material:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The name `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons (C1 and C6).\n    *   It is substituted with methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry at the chiral centers is given as 1R, 3R, 4R, 6S.\n*   **Reagent:** Me2CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate). This is a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of a \"soft\" nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n### 2. Determine the Regioselectivity\nThe problem states a key rule for this reaction: *\"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"*\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by atoms C1, C6, and O(7).\n*   Carbon C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a tertiary carbon center.\n*   Carbon C6 does not have a methyl group (it has two bonds to other ring carbons and two bonds to H and O), making it a secondary carbon center.\n*   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon.\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group from Me2CuLi will attack carbon C6.\n\n### 3. Determine the Stereochemistry\nThe problem provides another key rule: *\"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"*\n*   This is a characteristic feature of an SN2 (bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) reaction mechanism.\n*   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the C6 carbon from the side opposite the C-O bond (backside attack).\n*   This attack breaks the C6-O bond and inverts the stereocenter at C6.\n*   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4) are not directly involved in the reaction and will remain unchanged. After an implicit acidic workup, the oxygen atom at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n### 4. Determine the Structure and Name of the Product\n*   The reaction opens the epoxide ring, resulting in a cyclohexanol derivative.\n*   The substituents in the product are:\n    *   An -OH group at the position of old C1.\n    *   A methyl group at the position of old C1.\n    *   A newly added methyl group at the position of old C6.\n    *   A methyl group at the position of old C3.\n    *   A methyl group at the position of old C4.\n*   The product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol. To name it according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1 (new numbering). We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   New C1 = old C1 (has -OH and -Me)\n    *   Path A (numbering clockwise): Substituents at 1-Me, old C2, old C3-Me, old C4-Me, old C5, old C6-Me. Locants: 1,3,4,6.\n    *   Path B (numbering counter-clockwise): Substituents at 1-Me, old C6-Me, old C5, old C4-Me, old C3-Me, old C2. Locants: 1,2,4,5.\n    *   The set of locants (1,2,4,5) is lower than (1,3,4,6). Thus, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n    *   This eliminates options A and B.\n\n### 5. Determine the Absolute Configuration (R/S) of the Product\nWe can deduce the configuration of each stereocenter in the product based on the configuration of the starting material.\n*   **Mapping of Stereocenters:**\n    *   Product C1 corresponds to starting material C1.\n    *   Product C2 corresponds to starting material C6.\n    *   Product C4 corresponds to starting material C4.\n    *   Product C5 corresponds to starting material C3.\n*   **Applying the Stereochemistry Rules:**\n    *   The configuration at **C1** is retained. It was **R** in the starting material, so it is **R** in the product.\n    *   The configuration at **C4** is retained. It was **R** in the starting material, so it is **R** in the product.\n    *   The configuration at old **C3** (now **C5**) is retained. It was **R** in the starting material, so it is **R** in the product.\n    *   The configuration at old **C6** (now **C2**) is inverted. It was **S** in the starting material, so it becomes **R** in the product.\n*   **Final Product Configuration:** Combining these gives the absolute configuration of the product as (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
