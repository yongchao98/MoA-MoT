    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the physical system and the method of images:**\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere has its electric potential fixed at zero (V=0). This problem is most easily solved using the \"method of images\".\n\nIn this method, we replace the conducting sphere with a fictional \"image charge\" `q'` located at a specific point `d'` inside the original sphere's volume. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface where the sphere used to be is zero, thus satisfying the boundary condition of the grounded sphere.\n\n**2. Determine the image charge and its position:**\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `d'` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n*   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the external charge `q`.\n\n**3. Calculate the potential energy:**\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` during this process is due to the attraction from the induced charges on the surface of the sphere. Using the method of images, this force is simply the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nHowever, a simpler way to calculate the energy is to use the formula for electrostatic energy of a system of charges and conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * Î£(q_i * V_i)`\nwhere `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\nIn our system, we have the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere. The induced charge on the sphere is effectively represented by `q'`.\nThe total energy is the work done on the charge `q` as it is brought from infinity. This work is given by:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nHere, `V_induced` is the potential at the final position of charge `q` (at distance `d` from the center) created by the induced charge distribution on the sphere. The factor of `1/2` is crucial and appears because the induced charge on the conductor is built up from zero as the charge `q` is brought in from infinity.\n\nUsing the method of images, the potential `V_induced` is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\nThe distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `d'`) is `r = d - d'`.\n\n`r = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n\nNow, calculate the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` due to `q'`:\n`V_induced = k * q' / r`\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\nThe `d` in the denominator of `q'` and the `d` in the denominator of `r` cancel out.\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nFinally, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Compare with the given options:**\nThe derived expression for the potential energy is `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur result matches option C exactly. The energy is negative, which makes physical sense as the charge `q` is attracted to the grounded sphere.\n\n<<<C>>>"
