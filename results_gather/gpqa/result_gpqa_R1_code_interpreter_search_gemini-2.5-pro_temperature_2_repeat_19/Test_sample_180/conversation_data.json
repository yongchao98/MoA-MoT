    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's question:**\n    *   **Core Scenario:** The pp-III branch of solar fusion stopped 8.5 minutes ago.\n    *   **Timing:** 8.5 minutes is the light-travel time from the Sun to Earth. This means the effects are just reaching us now. This detail confirms we should analyze the consequences of the pp-III branch stopping, but the time value itself doesn't enter the calculation.\n    *   **Constraint:** \"all other reactions remained as they were\". This is a simplifying assumption. I will take it to mean that the fluxes from all other neutrino sources (pp-I, pp-II, CNO cycle) remain at their standard levels.\n    *   **The Goal:** Calculate the approximate ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands: Flux(700-800 keV) / Flux(800-900 keV).\n\n2.  **Identify Neutrino Sources by Energy:**\n    I need to know which solar fusion reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy ranges.\n    *   **pp-chain:**\n        *   `p + p -> d + e+ + νe` (pp): Continuous spectrum up to 420 keV. **(Doesn't contribute to either band)**\n        *   `⁷Be + e- -> ⁷Li + νe` (⁷Be): Line spectrum, mainly at **861 keV**. Some at 384 keV. The 861 keV line is crucial.\n        *   `⁸B -> ⁸Be* + e+ + νe` (⁸B): Continuous spectrum up to ~15 MeV. This source contributes to both bands in the standard model.\n    *   **CNO cycle:**\n        *   `¹³N -> ¹³C + e+ + νe`: Continuous spectrum up to 1.20 MeV. **(Contributes to both bands)**\n        *   `¹⁵O -> ¹⁵N + e+ + νe`: Continuous spectrum up to 1.73 MeV. **(Contributes to both bands)**\n\n3.  **Apply the Hypothetical Scenario:**\n    *   The pp-III branch is the one that produces ⁸B.\n    *   \"pp-III branch ... stopped\" means the flux of **⁸B neutrinos becomes zero**.\n    *   Based on the constraint \"all other reactions remained as they were\", the fluxes from ⁷Be and the CNO cycle are unchanged.\n\n4.  **Determine the Sources for Each Band in the New Scenario:**\n    *   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   The only remaining sources in this range are the continuous spectra from the CNO cycle (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O` neutrinos).\n    *   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   The sources are the continuous spectra from the CNO cycle PLUS the monoenergetic line from `⁷Be` neutrinos at 861 keV.\n\n5.  **Estimate the Flux Magnitudes:**\n    To find the ratio, I need the approximate fluxes from these sources. I will use standard values from solar models.\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** This band contains the extremely strong ⁷Be line at 861 keV. The total flux of this line is F(⁷Be) ≈ 5.0 x 10⁹ neutrinos / (cm²·s). The contribution from the continuous CNO spectrum in this small 100 keV window is many orders of magnitude smaller and therefore negligible.\n        *   *So, Flux(Band 2) ≈ F(⁷Be) ≈ 5 x 10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹.*\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** This flux comes entirely from CNO neutrinos. The total CNO flux (sum of ¹³N and ¹⁵O) is F(CNO) ≈ 5.2 x 10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹. This total flux is spread across a wide energy range (up to ~1.7 MeV). We need to find the fraction that falls within our 100 keV window.\n        *   This requires a formal calculation, but for an \"approximate\" answer, we can make a reasoned estimate. The ratio of the total fluxes is F(CNO)/F(⁷Be) ≈ (5.2 x 10⁸) / (5 x 10⁹) ≈ 0.1.\n        *   Now, we need to estimate what fraction of the total CNO flux lies in the 700-800 keV band. The CNO spectra are continuous and broad. A 100 keV band out of a total range of >1 MeV will only contain a small fraction of the total neutrinos. A reasonable order-of-magnitude guess is that about 10% of the CNO flux might fall in this somewhat central region of its spectrum.\n        *   *So, Flux(Band 1) ≈ 10% of F(CNO) ≈ 0.1 * (5.2 x 10⁸) ≈ 5.2 x 10⁷ cm⁻²s⁻¹.*\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    Ratio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)\n    Ratio ≈ (5.2 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹)\n    Ratio ≈ 1.04 x 10⁻²\n    Ratio ≈ 0.01\n\n7.  **Final Check using a Python script:**\n    To confirm the estimate, I'll use a python script to perform a more precise calculation based on published solar neutrino spectral shapes and total fluxes. This will give a better estimate for the fraction of CNO flux in Band 1.\n\n    ```python\n    import numpy as np\n    from scipy.interpolate import interp1d\n    from scipy.integrate import quad\n\n    # These data points represent the general shape of the CNO neutrino spectra, derived from public plots.\n    # Energy in MeV, Shape is proportional to differential flux.\n    E_N = np.array([0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2]) # 13N\n    F_N_shape = np.array([0, 5.5e7, 7.5e7, 7.0e7, 4.0e7, 1.5e7, 0])\n\n    E_O = np.array([0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.73]) # 15O\n    F_O_shape = np.array([0, 4.5e7, 6.0e7, 5.5e7, 5.0e7, 4.0e7, 2.5e7, 1.2e7, 0.3e7, 0])\n\n    # Total integrated fluxes from the Standard Solar Model (in cm^-2 s^-1)\n    F_total_N = 2.96e8 # Total 13N flux\n    F_total_O = 2.23e8 # Total 15O flux\n    F_total_Be = 5.00e9 # Total 7Be flux\n\n    # Create interpolation functions for the shapes\n    interp_N_shape = interp1d(E_N, F_N_shape, kind='cubic', bounds_error=False, fill_value=0)\n    interp_O_shape = interp1d(E_O, F_O_shape, kind='cubic', bounds_error=False, fill_value=0)\n\n    # Integrate the shape functions to get normalization constants\n    integral_N_shape, _ = quad(interp_N_shape, 0, 1.2)\n    integral_O_shape, _ = quad(interp_O_shape, 0, 1.73)\n\n    # Define normalized differential flux functions that integrate to the correct total flux\n    def flux_N(E):\n        return interp_N_shape(E) * (F_total_N / integral_N_shape)\n\n    def flux_O(E):\n        return interp_O_shape(E) * (F_total_O / integral_O_shape)\n\n    def flux_CNO(E):\n        val_N = flux_N(E)\n        val_O = flux_O(E)\n        return val_N + val_O\n\n    # In the hypothetical scenario, 8B flux is zero.\n\n    # Flux in band 1 (700-800 keV -> 0.7-0.8 MeV) is from CNO neutrinos\n    flux_band1, _ = quad(flux_CNO, 0.7, 0.8)\n\n    # Flux in band 2 (800-900 keV -> 0.8-0.9 MeV) is dominated by the 7Be line\n    # We add the small CNO background for completeness\n    cno_flux_band2, _ = quad(flux_CNO, 0.8, 0.9)\n    flux_band2 = F_total_Be + cno_flux_band2\n\n    # Calculate the final ratio\n    ratio = flux_band1 / flux_band2\n    print(f\"{ratio=}\")\n    ```\n\n    <execute_code>\n    ```python\n    import numpy as np\n    from scipy.interpolate import interp1d\n    from scipy.integrate import quad\n\n    # These data points represent the general shape of the CNO neutrino spectra, derived from public plots.\n    # Energy in MeV, Shape is proportional to differential flux.\n    E_N = np.array([0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2]) # 13N\n    F_N_shape = np.array([0, 5.5e7, 7.5e7, 7.0e7, 4.0e7, 1.5e7, 0])\n\n    E_O = np.array([0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.73]) # 15O\n    F_O_shape = np.array([0, 4.5e7, 6.0e7, 5.5e7, 5.0e7, 4.0e7, 2.5e7, 1.2e7, 0.3e7, 0])\n\n    # Total integrated fluxes from the Standard Solar Model (in cm^-2 s^-1)\n    F_total_N = 2.96e8 # Total 13N flux\n    F_total_O = 2.23e8 # Total 15O flux\n    F_total_Be = 5.00e9 # Total 7Be flux\n\n    # Create interpolation functions for the shapes\n    interp_N_shape = interp1d(E_N, F_N_shape, kind='cubic', bounds_error=False, fill_value=0)\n    interp_O_shape = interp1d(E_O, F_O_shape, kind='cubic', bounds_error=False, fill_value=0)\n\n    # Integrate the shape functions to get normalization constants\n    integral_N_shape, _ = quad(interp_N_shape, 0, 1.2)\n    integral_O_shape, _ = quad(interp_O_shape, 0, 1.73)\n\n    # Define normalized differential flux functions that integrate to the correct total flux\n    def flux_N(E):\n        # The quad function may pass negative values near the boundary, which can cause issues with cubic interpolation\n        if hasattr(E, \"__len__\"):\n            E[E < 0] = 0\n        elif E < 0:\n            E = 0\n        return interp_N_shape(E) * (F_total_N / integral_N_shape)\n\n    def flux_O(E):\n        if hasattr(E, \"__len__\"):\n            E[E < 0] = 0\n        elif E < 0:\n            E = 0\n        return interp_O_shape(E) * (F_total_O / integral_O_shape)\n\n    def flux_CNO(E):\n        val_N = flux_N(E)\n        val_O = flux_O(E)\n        return val_N + val_O\n\n    # In the hypothetical scenario, 8B flux is zero.\n\n    # Flux in band 1 (700-800 keV -> 0.7-0.8 MeV) is from CNO neutrinos\n    flux_band1, _ = quad(flux_CNO, 0.7, 0.8)\n\n    # Flux in band 2 (800-900 keV -> 0.8-0.9 MeV) is dominated by the 7Be line\n    # We add the small CNO background for completeness\n    cno_flux_band2, _ = quad(flux_CNO, 0.8, 0.9)\n    flux_band2 = F_total_Be + cno_flux_band2\n\n    # Calculate the final ratio\n    ratio = flux_band1 / flux_band2\n    print(f\"{ratio=}\")\n    ```\n    </execute_code>\n    \n    <results>\n    ```text\n    ratio=0.009494391629554366\n    ```\n    </results>\n\n    The script returns a ratio of approximately 0.0095.
