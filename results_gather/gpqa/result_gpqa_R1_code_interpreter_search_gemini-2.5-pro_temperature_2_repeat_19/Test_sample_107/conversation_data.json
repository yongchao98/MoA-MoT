    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Identify the Physical Quantities to Compare**\n\nWe need to compare two energy values:\n1.  **The paramagnetic coupling energy, $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$**: This is the energy shift due to the interaction of the atom's orbital magnetic moment with the external magnetic field $\\vec{B}$. This is also known as the Zeeman effect energy.\n2.  **The transition energy, $\\Delta E$**: This is the energy difference between two electronic states in the Hydrogen atom, corresponding to the emission or absorption of a photon with a specific wavelength $\\lambda$.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Expression for the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the interaction of a magnetic dipole moment $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ with a magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is:\n$H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the electron mass.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian gives:\n$H = -\\left(-\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}\\right) \\cdot \\vec{B} = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}\\cdot\\vec{B}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The dot product becomes:\n$\\vec{L}\\cdot\\vec{B} = L_z B$\n\nThe energy is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$. The eigenvalues of the operator $L_z$ are quantized and given by $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Therefore, the energy shift is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e B}{2m_e}\\left\\langle L_z\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B$\n\nThe term $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is a fundamental physical constant known as the **Bohr magneton**, $\\mu_B$.\n$\\mu_B = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$\n\nSo, the final expression for the paramagnetic coupling energy is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n\n### **3. Formulate the Expression for the Transition Energy $\\Delta E$**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Numerical Values**\n\nWe are given:\n*   $B = 1 \\text{ T}$\n*   $m$ is small (we can use $m=1$ for an order-of-magnitude calculation, as other small integer values will not change the result significantly).\n*   $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nLet's calculate both energies using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# --- Part 1: Calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy <H> ---\n\n# Bohr magneton (mu_B) in J/T\nmu_B = const.value('Bohr magneton')\n\n# Magnetic field in Tesla\nB = 1.0\n\n# Orbital magnetic quantum number (m).

Compare the Results**\n\nFrom the calculations:\n*   The paramagnetic coupling energy is $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$.\n*   The transition energy is $\\Delta E \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$.\n\nComparing the two values, we see that $\\Delta E$ is about 5 orders of magnitude larger than $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$. The ratio is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$, which is a very small number.\n\nThis means that the energy splitting caused by a 1 Tesla magnetic field is much, much smaller than the energy of a typical electronic transition in the visible spectrum for the Hydrogen atom.\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "### **Detailed Reasoning and Analysis**\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy, $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$, due to an external magnetic field, with the energy of an electronic transition, $\\Delta E$, in a Hydrogen atom.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)**\n    *   The Hamiltonian for the interaction between the orbital magnetic moment ($\\vec{\\mu}_L$) of an electron and an external magnetic field ($\\vec{B}$) is given by $H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$.\n    *   The orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum ($\\vec{L}$) by $\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the mass of the electron.\n    *   Substituting this into the Hamiltonian gives: $H = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$.\n    *   The problem states the magnetic field is parallel to the z-axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The dot product simplifies to $\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$.\n    *   Thus, the energy of this interaction is $H = \\frac{eB}{2m_e}L_z$.\n    *   In quantum mechanics, the operator $L_z$ has eigenvalues of $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the magnetic orbital quantum number. So, the energy levels are given by $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B$.\n    *   The term $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is a physical constant known as the **Bohr magneton** ($\\mu_B$).\n        *   $\\mu_B = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$\n    *   So, the formula for the energy is $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   We are given $B = 1 \\text{ T}$.\n        *   We are told $m$ is small. For an order-of-magnitude calculation, we can choose the smallest non-zero integer value, $m=1$.\n        *   $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n    *   The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength ($\\lambda$) by the Planck-Einstein relation: $\\Delta E = hf = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   The wavelength is given as $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$. (Note: This specific wavelength corresponds to the Balmer series $n=4 \\to n=2$ transition in Hydrogen, known as H-beta).\n    *   **Constants:**\n        *   $h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n        *   $c = 3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   $\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n        *   $\\Delta E \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$.\n\n4.  **Compare the Magnitudes**\n    *   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$.\n    *   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$.\n    *   To compare them, let's find the ratio:\n        *   $\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n    *   This ratio is extremely small ($2.27 \\times 10^{-5} \\ll 1$), which means that $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$ is many orders of magnitude smaller than $\\Delta E$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The comparison clearly shows that the paramagnetic coupling energy for a 1T field is significantly smaller than the energy of a typical electronic transition in the visible spectrum. Therefore, the correct relationship is $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.\n\nUsing LaTeX for the final representation of the expressions:\n$$\n\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m\\mu_{B}B \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}\n$$\nThe comparison leads to:\n$$\n\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E\n$$\n\n<<<B>>>"
