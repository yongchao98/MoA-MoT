    "The user wants to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n2.  **Simplifying the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2). Since both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are constant. The problem also states that the albedo (`A`) is the same for both planets. Therefore, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on their semi-major axes (`a`).\n\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)`\n\n    So, the ratio is:\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)`\n\n3.  **Applying Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (P) to the semi-major axis (a):\n    `P^2 ∝ a^3`\n    This can be rearranged to express `a` in terms of `P`:\n    `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\n4.  **Substituting into the Temperature Ratio:** Now we can substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law into our temperature ratio equation:\n    `a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = sqrt((P_2 / P_4)^(2/3))`\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))`\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Using the Given Period Ratios:** The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as:\n    `P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5`\n    From this, we can find the ratio `P_2 / P_4`:\n    `P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the period ratio into the final equation:\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n\nLet's compute the value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given orbital period ratios\nP_ratio_2 = 2\nP_ratio_4 = 3.5\n\n# Ratio of orbital periods P2/P4\nP_ratio_2_over_4 = P_ratio_2 / P_ratio_4\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T4/T2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3)\nT_ratio_4_over_2 = P_ratio_2_over_4**(1/3)\n\nprint(T_ratio_4_over_2)\n```\n>0.8298716531988869\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) ~0.57\nB) ~0.69\nC) ~0.83\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties (temperature and radius), the planet's albedo (A), and its distance from the star (the semi-major axis 'a'). The formula is:\n    `T_eq ∝ (1 - A)^(1/4) / sqrt(a)`\n\n2.  **Simplifying for the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2).\n    -   Since both planets orbit the same star, the star's properties are constant and cancel out.\n    -   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (A), so the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term also cancels out.\n    -   This leaves us with the relationship: `T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)`.\n    -   Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n        `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)`\n\n3.  **Applying Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a):\n    `P² ∝ a³`\n    We can rearrange this to express the semi-major axis in terms of the orbital period:\n    `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n    So, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    `a₂ / a₄ = (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3)`\n\n4.  **Combining the Formulas:** Now, substitute the expression for `a₂ / a₄` from Kepler's Law into our temperature ratio equation:\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = sqrt((P₂ / P₄)^(2/3))`\n    The square root and the square in the exponent cancel each other out:\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Using the Given Period Ratios:** The problem gives the orbital period ratios as `1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5` for Planet_1 through Planet_5. From this, we can determine the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    `P₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute this value into our final equation:\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)`\n    `T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) ≈ 0.8298`\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives ~0.83. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
