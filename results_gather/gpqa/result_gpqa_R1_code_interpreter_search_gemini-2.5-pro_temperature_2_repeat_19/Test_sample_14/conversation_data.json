    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to determine which of the two planets, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher geometric probability of transiting its host star and to quantify the ratio of their probabilities.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a transit (`p_T`) for a planet in a circular orbit is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n    `p_T = R_s / a`\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (`p_T1`) to that of Planet_2 (`p_T2`).\n    `p_T1 / p_T2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)`\n\n4.  **Incorporate Known Information:** The problem states that both host stars have the same radius (`R_s1 = R_s2`). Let's call this radius `R_s`. The equation simplifies to:\n    `p_T1 / p_T2 = (R_s / a1) / (R_s / a2) = a2 / a1`\n    This shows that the ratio of transit probabilities is the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Physical Properties:** To find the ratio `a2 / a1`, we use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion:\n    `P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_s`\n    Where `P` is the orbital period and `M_s` is the mass of the host star. We can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n    `a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_s`\n    `a ∝ (P^2 * M_s)^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can express the ratio `a2 / a1` in terms of the planets' periods and their host stars' masses.\n    `a2 / a1 = [ (P2^2 * M_s2) / (P1^2 * M_s1) ]^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Substitute the Given Relationships:** We are given the following from the problem description:\n    *   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P2 = 3 * P1`.\n    *   The mass of Star_1 is twice that of Star_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n\n    Substitute these into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = [ ((3 * P1)^2 * M_s2) / (P1^2 * (2 * M_s2)) ]^(1/3)`\n    `a2 / a1 = [ (9 * P1^2 * M_s2) / (2 * P1^2 * M_s2) ]^(1/3)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:** The terms `P1^2` and `M_s2` cancel out from the numerator and the denominator.\n    `a2 / a1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    `a2 / a1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n9.  **Compute the Final Value:** The ratio of the probabilities is `p_T1 / p_T2 = a2 / a1`. We need to calculate the cube root of 4.5.\n```python\nimport math\nratio = (4.5)**(1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n> 실행 결과\n```\n1.6509640029961567\n```\n\n10. **Interpret the Result:** The calculation shows that `p_T1 / p_T2 ≈ 1.65`.\n    *   Since the ratio is greater than 1, `p_T1` is larger than `p_T2`.\n    *   This means Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.\n    *   The probability is approximately 1.65 times higher.\n\n11. **Match with Options:** This result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the ratio of the stellar radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (assuming a circular orbit): `p_transit = R_star / a`.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to Planet_2:\nRatio = `p_transit1 / p_transit2 = (R_star1 / a1) / (R_star2 / a2)`\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that the radii of the host stars are the same:\n`R_star1 = R_star2`\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\nRatio = `a2 / a1`\n\nTo find the semi-major axes (`a`), we use Kepler's Third Law:\n`P^2 / a^3 ∝ 1 / M_star`\nor `a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_star`\nSo, `a ∝ (P^2 * M_star)^(1/3)`\n\nNow we can write the ratio of the semi-major axes in terms of the periods and stellar masses:\nRatio = `a2 / a1 = [ (P2^2 * M_star2) / (P1^2 * M_star1) ]^(1/3)`\n\nThe problem gives us the following relationships:\n1.  The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P2 = 3 * P1`\n2.  The mass of the star hosting Planet_1 is twice that of the host star of Planet_2: `M_star1 = 2 * M_star2`\n\nNow, substitute these relationships into the ratio equation:\nRatio = `[ ((3*P1)^2 * M_star2) / (P1^2 * (2*M_star2)) ]^(1/3)`\nRatio = `[ (9 * P1^2 * M_star2) / (2 * P1^2 * M_star2) ]^(1/3)`\n\nThe terms `P1^2` and `M_star2` cancel out:\nRatio = `(9 / 2)^(1/3)`\nRatio = `(4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nCalculating the value:\nRatio ≈ 1.65096\n\nThis means that the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
