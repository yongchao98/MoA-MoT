    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the physical process\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) with a low-energy Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon ($\\gamma_{CMB}$) to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^{-}e^{+}$). The reaction is:\n$\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{-} + e^{+}$\n\n### 2. Apply the principles of special relativity\nFor this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the products. The products are an electron and a positron, each with a rest mass $m_e$.\nSo, the threshold condition in the CM frame is:\n$E_{CM} \\ge 2m_e c^2$\n\nThe quantity that is the same in all inertial frames (a Lorentz invariant) is the square of the total four-momentum, denoted by $s$. At the threshold, we have:\n$s = (E_{CM})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2$\n\n### 3. Calculate the invariant mass `s` in the Lab frame\nLet's now express $s$ in the laboratory frame, which is the frame of the universe where the CMB is nearly at rest. Let the high-energy gamma-ray have energy $E_\\gamma$ and momentum $\\vec{p}_\\gamma$, and the CMB photon have energy $E_{CMB}$ and momentum $\\vec{p}_{CMB}$.\n\nThe four-momenta are $p_\\gamma = (E_\\gamma/c, \\vec{p}_\\gamma)$ and $p_{CMB} = (E_{CMB}/c, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$. The invariant mass squared $s$ is given by:\n$s = (p_\\gamma + p_{CMB})^2 c^2 = p_\\gamma^2 c^2 + p_{CMB}^2 c^2 + 2(p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB})c^2$\n\nFor photons, the rest mass is zero, so $p^2c^2 = E^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2c^2 = 0$. This means $E=|\\vec{p}|c$.\nTherefore, $p_\\gamma^2 = 0$ and $p_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\nThe expression for $s$ simplifies to:\n$s = 2(p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB})c^2 = 2 \\left( \\frac{E_\\gamma E_{CMB}}{c^2} - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} \\right) c^2$\n$s = 2(E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - |\\vec{p}_\\gamma||\\vec{p}_{CMB}|c^2 \\cos\\theta)$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\nSince $E=|\\vec{p}|c$ for photons, we can write:\n$s = 2(E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - \\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\frac{E_{CMB}}{c} c^2 \\cos\\theta) = 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\n### 4. Find the minimum threshold energy\nThe question asks for the energy from which lifetimes are limited. This corresponds to the minimum possible energy $E_\\gamma$ for the reaction to occur. From the equation for $s$, we see that for a fixed $s$, $E_\\gamma$ is minimized when the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized. This occurs for a head-on collision, where the photons travel towards each other. In this case, $\\theta = \\pi$ (or 180Â°), and $\\cos\\pi = -1$.\nThe term becomes $1 - (-1) = 2$.\nSo, for the minimum threshold energy, we have:\n$s = 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - (-1)) = 4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$\n\n### 5. Equate and solve for E_gamma\nNow we equate the expressions for $s$ from the CM frame and the lab frame at the threshold:\n$(2m_e c^2)^2 = 4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$\n$4(m_e c^2)^2 = 4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n### 6. Substitute the given values and calculate\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation:\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_\\gamma = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question's options are in GeV. To convert from eV to GeV, we divide by $10^9$:\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}}$\n$E_\\gamma = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n$E_\\gamma = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV.\n\n### 7. Compare with the options\nThe calculated value $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV matches option C.\n\n(A) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV = 0.95 * 1e5 GeV\n(B) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\n(C) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\n(D) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
