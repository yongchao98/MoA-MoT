    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical system:** The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential energy of a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the restoring force is independent of direction, i.e., the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same for oscillations along the x, y, and z axes.\n\n2.  **Determine the energy eigenvalues:** The Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved by separating the variables in Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z). The total energy is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n    The energy for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n    So, the total energy is:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    We can define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n    The energy levels are then given by the formula:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Identify the energy levels corresponding to different states:**\n    *   **Ground state:** This is the lowest energy state, corresponding to $n=0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First excited state:** This is the next higher energy state, corresponding to $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second excited state:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third excited state:** The question asks for this state, which corresponds to $n=3$.\n        The energy of the third excited state is:\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the degeneracy of the third excited state:** The degeneracy is the number of distinct sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that correspond to the same energy eigenvalue. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways we can choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3.\n    $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$\n\n    Let's list the possible combinations (partitions of 3 into 3 parts):\n    *   **Partition (3, 0, 0):** The permutations are (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), and (0, 0, 3). This gives 3 states.\n    *   **Partition (2, 1, 0):** The permutations are (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), and (0, 1, 2). This gives 6 states.\n    *   **Partition (1, 1, 1):** The only permutation is (1, 1, 1). This gives 1 state.\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities:\n    Degeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n    Alternatively, there is a general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The third excited state has an energy of $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and a degeneracy of 10. This means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy.\n\n6.  **Compare with the options:**\n    *   A) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 3 -> Incorrect energy form and degeneracy.\n    *   B) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, 3 -> Correct energy, incorrect degeneracy.\n    *   C) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, 10 -> Correct energy and correct degeneracy.\n    *   D) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 10 -> Incorrect energy form.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
