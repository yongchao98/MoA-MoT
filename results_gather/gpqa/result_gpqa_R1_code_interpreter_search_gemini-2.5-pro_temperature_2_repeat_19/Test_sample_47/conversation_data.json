    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine (Br₂), forming product 1.**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Br₂\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) was heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), forming product 2.**\nThis reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. This rearrangement involves the formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate, which then undergoes ring opening to form a carboxylic acid derivative with a rearranged carbon skeleton. For cyclic α-halo ketones, this typically results in ring contraction.\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone (a 6-membered ring)\n*   **Reagent:** NaOH, heat\n*   **Reaction:** Favorskii rearrangement\n*   **Mechanism Outline:**\n    1.  Hydroxide (OH⁻) abstracts an α'-proton (from C6) to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate undergoes intramolecular Sₙ2 attack, displacing the bromide to form a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one intermediate.\n    3.  Hydroxide attacks the carbonyl carbon.\n    4.  The strained cyclopropane ring opens to form a more stable cyclopentane ring with a carboxylate group.\n    5.  Protonation during workup yields the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n \n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) was treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine, forming 3.**\nThionyl chloride is a standard reagent used to convert carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides. Pyridine is added as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reagent:** SOCl₂\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n \n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OᵗBu)₃), forming product 4.**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to the alcohol (unlike the more powerful LiAlH₄).\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reagent:** LiAlH(OᵗBu)₃\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n \n\n**Final Step: Counting the chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde).**\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry (Cₛ symmetry). This plane contains the aldehyde group (-CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the cyclopentane ring.\n\nLet's identify the different sets of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This hydrogen is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type of H)\n2.  **The proton on C1 (the carbon attached to the CHO group):** This hydrogen is also unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type of H)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent because they are reflected into each other by the plane of symmetry. On each of these carbons, there are two protons. These two protons (geminal protons) are diastereotopic because of the substituent on C1. This means they are chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   One set consists of the two \"cis\" protons (relative to the aldehyde group).\n    *   Another set consists of the two \"trans\" protons.\n    This gives 2 more types of H.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic, and they are equivalent to their corresponding counterparts on C4.\n    *   This gives another two sets of chemically non-equivalent protons.\n    This gives 2 more types of H.\n\n**Tallying the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:**\n*   H_aldehyde: 1 type\n*   H on C1: 1 type\n*   H on C2/C5: 2 types\n*   H on C3/C4: 2 types\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. This means the ¹H NMR spectrum of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde would show 6 different signals.\n\n<<<A>>>"
