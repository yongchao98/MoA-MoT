    "This question asks for the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of this approximation and then evaluate each of the four statements.\n\nThe core idea of the impulse approximation is to simplify a complex many-body problem (an interaction with a nucleus) into a much simpler two-body problem (an interaction with a single, free nucleon). The name \"impulse\" comes from the idea that the interaction happens over a very short time, like a sudden impulse, so fast that other forces and complexities of the system don't have time to have an effect.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the foundational assumption. The impulse approximation explicitly ignores interactions that inherently involve multiple nucleons at the same time (these are known as meson-exchange currents or many-body currents). The approximation assumes the incoming probe or field (e.g., a photon, electron, or neutrino) \"picks out\" and interacts with just one nucleon. This statement is essential.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This statement addresses what happens before and after the primary interaction. If the incoming probe scatters off other nucleons on its way in, or the outgoing nucleon scatters off other nucleons on its way out, the process is not simple. These are called \"final-state interactions\" (FSI) or \"initial-state interactions\" (ISI). The purest form of the impulse approximation, often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA), assumes the nucleus is \"transparent\" to both the incoming and outgoing particles, meaning there are no such interactions. Therefore, this assumption is a key part of the idealised picture.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This statement deals with the sub-structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation is a framework for describing the behavior of nucleons *within a nucleus*. It treats the nucleon as the fundamental particle for the interaction. The internal structure of the nucleon (i.e., its quark and gluon composition) is already contained within the definition of a \"free nucleon\". Whether the quarks inside are relativistic or not is a separate question of particle physics (specifically, quantum chromodynamics) and is not a precondition for the impulse approximation itself. Thus, this statement is not a required assumption for this approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the central \"impulse\" idea. A nucleon in a nucleus is bound by the strong force, holding it in a potential well. This statement posits that the interaction happens so quickly that the binding potential doesn't have time to act *during* the short duration of the scattering event. The nucleon is effectively \"frozen\" in its orbital at the moment of interaction, and the scattering proceeds as if it were a free particle with that instantaneous momentum. This is a crucial assumption for treating the nucleon as \"free\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe essential assumptions for the impulse approximation are:\n*   The interaction happens with a single nucleon (Statement 1).\n*   The effects of the surrounding nucleons are ignored, both in terms of initial/final state interactions (Statement 2) and binding forces *during* the collision (Statement 4).\n*   The internal structure of the nucleon (Statement 3) is not part of the set of assumptions for the impulse approximation.\n\nTherefore, the combination of statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describes the impulse approximation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
