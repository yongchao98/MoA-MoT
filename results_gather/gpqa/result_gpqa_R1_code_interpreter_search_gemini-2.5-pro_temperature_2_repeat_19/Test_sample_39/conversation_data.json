    "In the context of a synthetic organic chemistry lab, chemists frequently use purification techniques to isolate the desired product from starting materials, byproducts, and other impurities. One of the most common and powerful purification techniques is chromatography, such as thin-layer chromatography (TLC) for analysis and column chromatography for large-scale separation.\n\nChromatography separates compounds based on their differential interactions with a stationary phase (a solid like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a liquid solvent or solvent mixture). A key property that governs these interactions is **polarity**.\n\n*   In normal-phase chromatography (the most common type), the stationary phase is polar (e.g., silica gel), and the mobile phase is less polar. Compounds travel up a TLC plate or down a column based on their polarity. Less polar compounds spend more time in the mobile phase and travel faster, while more polar compounds adhere more strongly to the stationary phase and travel slower.\n*   The goal is to find a solvent system (mobile phase) that separates the different compounds into distinct spots (on a TLC plate) or bands (in a column).\n\nThe phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a very common piece of lab jargon. It visually describes the outcome of a failed chromatographic separation.\n*   On a TLC plate, this means the spots for the different compounds have traveled the same distance and are overlapping, appearing as a single spot.\n*   In column chromatography, it means the different compounds are eluting from the column at the same time, so they cannot be collected in separate fractions.\n\nWhy would this happen? The most direct reason is that the compounds being separated have **very similar polarities**. Because they have similar polarities, they interact with the stationary and mobile phases in an almost identical manner, causing them to move at the same speed. Consequently, the technique fails to resolve them.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n*   A) Similar optical rotations: Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules and is measured by polarimetry. It is not a basis for common separation techniques like chromatography or distillation. While separating enantiomers (which have equal and opposite optical rotations) is difficult, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is specifically linked to the visual output of chromatography.\n*   B) Similar boiling points: This would make separation by distillation difficult. However, chemists are more likely to say the compounds \"co-distill\" rather than they are \"on top of each other.\" The latter phrase is much more evocative of a failed chromatogram.\n*   C) Non-covalent interactions: These interactions (which are related to polarity) are the *basis* of how chromatography works. The problem isn't that the interactions exist, but that the overall polarity and resulting interactions for the different compounds are too similar to allow for separation. So, while related, option D is the more precise and direct cause of the observed problem.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is most likely complaining that a chromatographic separation has failed because the compounds have similar polarities.\n\n<<<D>>>"
