    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction:**\n    *   **Reactant:** Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. \"Racemic\" means it is a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n    *   **Catalyst:** Grubbs catalyst.\n    *   **Reaction:** Olefin metathesis. For a terminal alkene like 3-methylpent-1-ene, this is a self-metathesis reaction.\n\n2.  **Understand the Self-Metathesis Reaction:**\n    The general reaction for the self-metathesis of a terminal alkene is:\n    2 R-CH=CH₂   <--[Grubbs]-->   R-CH=CH-R + H₂C=CH₂ (ethene)\n    The question asks to exclude ethene, so we need to focus on the dimer product, R-CH=CH-R.\n    In our case, the 'R' group is the chiral 3-methylpentyl group, specifically -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃ attached to the double bond. Let's denote the (R)-alkene as 'R-alk' and the (S)-alkene as 'S-alk'.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Dimerization Products:**\n    Since the starting material is a racemic mixture, there are three possible reaction pairings:\n    *   (R-alk) + (R-alk) → R-R dimer\n    *   (S-alk) + (S-alk) → S-S dimer\n    *   (R-alk) + (S-alk) → R-S dimer\n\n    The constitutional structure of all these dimers is the same: **3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene**.\n    CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃\n    We need to determine the number of stereoisomers that can be formed. This product has two chiral centers (at C-3 and C-6) and a double bond (at C-4) that can have E (trans) or Z (cis) geometry.\n\n4.  **Examine the Stereochemistry of Each Product Type:**\n\n    *   **(R-alk) + (R-alk) → (3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:**\n        This product is chiral (it has no internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion). The new double bond can be E or Z, creating two diastereomers:\n        1.  (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n        2.  (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n\n    *   **(S-alk) + (S-alk) → (3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:**\n        This product is the enantiomer of the (3R,6R) product. It is also chiral and will form two diastereomers (E and Z) which are the enantiomers of the products above.\n        3.  (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral, enantiomer of 1)\n        4.  (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral, enantiomer of 2)\n        So far, we have 4 distinct stereoisomeric products.\n\n    *   **(R-alk) + (S-alk) → (3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:**\n        This product results from the cross-coupling of the two different enantiomers. Because the two alkyl groups attached to the double bond are identical (both are 1-methylpropyl groups), having opposite stereochemistry at the two chiral centers (R at C-3 and S at C-6) results in an internally symmetric molecule. These are called **meso compounds**, and they are achiral.\n        Like the other products, this one can also have E or Z geometry at the double bond, creating two diastereomers.\n        *   **(E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond, making it an achiral meso compound.\n        *   **(Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=C bond, making it an achiral meso compound.\n        This gives us two more distinct stereoisomers:\n        5.  (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n        6.  (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n\n5.  **Count the Total Number of Products:**\n    Summing up all the unique stereoisomers, we have:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers with E geometry (2 products).\n    *   A pair of enantiomers with Z geometry (2 products).\n    *   A meso compound with E geometry (1 product).\n    *   A meso compound with Z geometry (1 product).\n\n    Total number of possible products (stereoisomers) = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\nAll six of these stereoisomers are diastereomeric to each other (except for the enantiomeric pairs) and are considered possible products of the reaction.\n\nFinal check of options:\nA) 2\nB) 6\nC) 8\nD) 4\n\nOur calculated total number of possible stereoisomers is 6, which matches option B. The other options are incorrect:\n*   4 would be the answer if one considered a racemic mixture (a pair of enantiomers) as a single product. This counts separable fractions, not all possible molecular structures.\n*   8 is the theoretical maximum number of stereoisomers calculated by 2³, but it fails to account for the symmetry that leads to meso compounds, reducing the actual number.\n*   2 is too small and ignores most of the possible stereochemical outcomes.\n\n<<<B>>>"
