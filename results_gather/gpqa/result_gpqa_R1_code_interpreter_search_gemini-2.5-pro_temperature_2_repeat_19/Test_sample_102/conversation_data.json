    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   Benzene ring is the core.\n    *   Substituents are: an acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    *   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship with each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    Understanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Plausible Direct Synthesis Routes:**\n    A simple approach might be to add the groups one by one.\n    *   **Route A-like start:**\n        1.  **Acylation:** Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n        2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone. This works because the acetyl group directs the bromine to the *meta* position.\n        3.  **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → ?\n            At this stage, the ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho,para*-director (-Br at C3). The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to C5. The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In such cases of conflicting directors, the outcome can be a mixture of products. While the desired 3-bromo-5-nitro isomer is often formed, this direct nitration may not be a \"high-yield\" or highly selective method. More complex sequences are often employed to guarantee regiocontrol.\n\n    *   **Other direct routes:**\n        *   Starting with nitration fails because Friedel-Crafts acylation does not work on a strongly deactivated ring like nitrobenzene.\n        *   Starting with bromination and then acylation would yield mainly the *para*-isomer (4-bromoacetophenone), which leads to the wrong final product.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Provided Options as Complete Sequences:**\n    The question asks for a sequence that provides a *high-yield* synthesis. This often implies a multi-step pathway that uses the directing effects of temporary functional groups to ensure the correct placement of substituents. The presence of steps like reduction (Fe/HCl) and deamination (NaNO2/HCl followed by H3PO2) strongly suggests the use of an amino group (-NH2) as a powerful directing group that is later removed.\n\n    Let's analyze **Option A** in full, as it seems the most elaborate and potentially correct pathway:\n\n    *   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** Standard Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    *   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The -COCH3 group directs bromination to the meta position.\n    *   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (and other isomers):** Nitration occurs. As discussed, this might give a mixture. Let's assume we isolate the 4-nitro isomer (which is ortho to the bromo group and para to the acetyl group) to use in the next steps. A key insight in complex synthesis is that sometimes an \"unwanted\" isomer from one step can be the key to the next.\n    *   **iv) Product from (iii) + Fe/HCl → 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The nitro group (-NO2) is selectively reduced to a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   **v) Product from (iv) + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** Now we perform another nitration. Let's analyze the directing effects on the ring:\n        *   -NH2 at C4: Strongly activating, *ortho,para*-director. Directs to C3 (blocked) and **C5**.\n        *   -COCH3 at C1: Deactivating, *meta*-director. Directs to C3 (blocked) and **C5**.\n        *   -Br at C3: Deactivating, *ortho,para*-director. Directs to C2 and C6.\n        Both the very powerful amino group and the acetyl group strongly direct the new nitro group to position **C5**. This step proceeds with high regioselectivity, which is the hallmark of a good synthesis.\n    *   **vi) Product from (v) + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt:** The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    *   **vii) Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\n    This full sequence is a logical and elegant synthetic strategy. It uses an intermediate (the 4-nitro isomer) and converts its nitro group into a powerful directing group (-NH2) to control the position of the second nitro group, then removes the temporary directing group to yield the final product with high purity.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Other Options:**\n    *   **Option B:** Fails because it involves a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (step iii), which is problematic, and subsequent steps do not lead to the correct substitution pattern.\n    *   **Option C:** Fails because Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on the highly deactivated 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene would not work effectively.\n    *   **Option D:** Steps i-iv result in converting benzene back to benzene, making the sequence nonsensical. Subsequent steps lead to the wrong isomer.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The sequence in Option A represents a valid, albeit complex, synthetic route that ensures high yield and regiochemical control by using a temporary directing group. It is the only option that logically leads to the desired product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
