    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n### Step 1: Decode the identities of the chemical substances.\n\nWe are given a series of reactions and properties for unknown substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. Let's analyze the clues one by one.\n\n*   **Clue 3: C + Water → A + Acid F + Acid G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.**\n    This hydrolysis reaction regenerates A and produces two different acids. This suggests that C is likely a halide of a non-metal, and the hydrolysis involves disproportionation.\n    Let's consider what the halogen might be. Hydrolysis of a chloride produces HCl, a strong acid. Hydrolysis of a fluoride produces HF, a weak acid.\n    Therefore, it's highly likely that C is a chloride, **B is chlorine gas (Cl₂)**, and **F is hydrochloric acid (HCl)**.\n\n*   **Let's verify this hypothesis with other clues.**\n    Assuming B = Cl₂, we can now re-evaluate the other reactions.\n\n*   **Clue 1: Solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → Bright red product C.**\n    Substituting B = Cl₂, the reaction is: **A(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) → C (bright red)**.\n    The 1:8 stoichiometry is very distinctive. Let's consider elemental sulfur (A) which exists as a solid crown-shaped octatomic molecule, **S₈**.\n    The reaction would be: **S₈(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) → 8 SCl₂(l)**.\n    This reaction has the exact 1:8 stoichiometry between reactant A (S₈) and reactant B (Cl₂). The product, C, is sulfur dichloride (**SCl₂**). SCl₂ is described as a cherry-red liquid, which is a good match for the \"bright red product\".\n    So, we have:\n    *   **A = S₈** (Sulfur)\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine)\n    *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride)\n\n*   **Let's check if the hydrolysis (Clue 3) works for C = SCl₂.**\n    The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride is a known disproportionation reaction:\n    **2 SCl₂ + 2 H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4 HCl(aq)**\n    Let's analyze the products:\n    *   **S(s)**: Solid sulfur is reformed. Since A is S₈, this fits the clue \"reforms A\".\n    *   **HCl(aq)**: Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid. This matches F.\n    *   **SO₂(g)**: Sulfur dioxide dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (**H₂SO₃**), which is a weak acid. This matches G.\n    This reaction fits Clue 3 perfectly.\n\n*   **Now let's identify D, E, and H.**\n    **Clue 4: D(g) + B(g) (1:1 ratio) → H (solvent)**\n    Substituting B = Cl₂, this becomes **D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H (solvent)**. D is a gas. A common reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethylene:\n    **C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)**\n    Here, **D would be ethylene (C₂H₄)**, and **H would be 1,2-dichloroethane**, a widely used industrial solvent. This is a very plausible fit.\n\n*   **Finally, let's check Clue 2 with our identified substances.**\n    **Clue 2: C + 2 equivalents of gas D → Extremely hazardous product E**\n    Substituting C = SCl₂ and D = C₂H₄:\n    **SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**\n    This is the Levinstein process for the synthesis of **mustard gas** (bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide). Mustard gas is a notoriously toxic chemical warfare agent, fitting the description \"extremely hazardous product\" perfectly.\n    Therefore, **E is mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\nNow that we have identified E as mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S, we need to find its molecular point group.\n\n1.  **Molecular Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two identical chloroethyl groups: Cl-CH₂-CH₂-S-CH₂-CH₂-Cl.\n2.  **Geometry:**\n    *   The geometry around the sulfur atom is bent due to its two bonding pairs and two lone pairs (VSEPR theory, AX₂E₂). The C-S-C angle is approximately 100-103°.\n    *   The geometry around each carbon atom is tetrahedral.\n    *   The molecule is flexible due to single bond rotations (around C-S and C-C bonds). We must consider the most stable conformation.\n3.  **Symmetry Elements of the Stable Conformation:**\n    The lowest energy conformation seeks to minimize steric repulsion between the two chloroethyl \"arms\" and adopt staggered arrangements along the C-C bonds. This results in a \"twisted\" or chiral structure. Let's analyze the symmetry elements of this conformer:\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    *   **Proper Rotation Axis (Cₙ):** A **C₂ axis** can pass through the sulfur atom and bisect the C-S-C angle. Rotating the molecule 180° about this axis perfectly interchanges the two identical chloroethyl groups. This is a symmetry element of the most stable conformation.\n    *   **Mirror Plane (σ):** The molecule does not possess any mirror planes. A plane containing the C₂ axis and the S atom would not work because the chloroethyl groups are staggered out of such a plane. A plane perpendicular to the C₂ axis would not work either. The lack of mirror planes means the molecule is chiral.\n    *   **Inversion Center (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n    *   **Improper Rotation Axis (Sₙ):** As the molecule is chiral, it cannot have an improper rotation axis (since S₁ = σ and S₂ = i).\n\n4.  **Point Group Assignment:**\n    A molecule that only possesses the identity element (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) D∞h: For linear molecules with inversion center (e.g., CO₂). Incorrect.\nB) C2v: Requires a C₂ axis and two mirror planes (e.g., H₂O). Incorrect, as mustard gas lacks mirror planes.\nC) C₂: Requires only a C₂ axis. This matches our analysis.\nD) D4h: A high-symmetry group for planar molecules (e.g., XeF₄). Incorrect.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is C₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"
