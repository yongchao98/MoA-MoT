    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The frequency is in the typical range for an ester, particularly one that is conjugated with the aromatic ring. An amide C=O would typically be at a lower frequency (around 1650-1680 cm-1).\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methyl group is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n=2), which is a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   This is the classic upfield part of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** This methylene group is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (n=3), which is a methyl group (-CH3-).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** A chemical shift this far downfield for a CH2 group means it is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen. This signal is the other half of the ethyl group, confirming an ethoxy-type structure (-O-CH2CH3).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two equivalent protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** This is characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those in O-H or N-H bonds.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Combined with the IR data, this signal is confidently assigned to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7-8 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Pattern:** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the signature pattern of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Shift Difference:** The large difference in chemical shifts (7.0 vs. 8.0 ppm) indicates that the two substituents on the ring have opposing electronic effects: one must be an electron-donating group (EDG), and the other must be an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). The EDG shields its ortho protons (moving them upfield to lower ppm), while the EWG deshields its ortho protons (moving them downfield to higher ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group.\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nThe only way to assemble these fragments that is consistent with all the data is to place the -NH2 group and the -COOCH2CH3 group at opposite ends (para position) of the benzene ring. This gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the aromatic signals:\n*   The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group should be shielded (upfield). These correspond to the doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n*   The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOEt group should be deshielded (downfield). These correspond to the doublet at 8.0 ppm.\nThis assignment is consistent.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is meta-substituted (would not give two doublets in NMR) and is an amide (wrong C=O frequency in IR).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ethyl group is part of a propionyl fragment (-CO-CH2CH3). The CH2 quartet would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Has a secondary amide (-NH-), which contradicts the IR and NMR data indicating a primary amine (-NH2) with two protons.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** All data points (Molecular Formula, DoU, IR, and 1H NMR) are fully consistent with this structure.\n\n<<<D>>>"
