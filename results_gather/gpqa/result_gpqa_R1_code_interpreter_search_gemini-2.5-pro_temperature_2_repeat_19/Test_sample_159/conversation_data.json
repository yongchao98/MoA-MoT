    "An N-sided polygon with a very large N (approaching infinity) and a constant apothem 'a' can be approximated as a circle. The apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle. Thus, the aperture is effectively a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe problem then becomes about the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture. The light travels along the z-axis and falls vertically on the aperture, which is standard for diffraction problems. We are interested in the far-field region.\n\nThe angular positions of the minima (dark rings) in the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of a circular aperture are given by the formula:\n`sin(θ) = m * λ / D`\nwhere:\n*   `θ` is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the monochromatic light.\n*   `D` is the diameter of the circular aperture.\n*   `m` is a coefficient derived from the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, `J₁(z)`.\n\nFor a circular aperture, the first minimum is not at `m=1` as in a single slit, but at `m ≈ 1.22`. The second minimum is at `m ≈ 2.233`. These values are derived from the first two zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`, denoted as `z₁` and `z₂`. Specifically, `m₁ = z₁/π ≈ 3.8317/π ≈ 1.220` and `m₂ = z₂/π ≈ 7.0156/π ≈ 2.233`.\n\nThe diameter `D` of our circular aperture is twice its radius `a`, so `D = 2a`.\n\nUsing the small angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`, we can find the angular positions of the first two minima, `θ₁` and `θ₂`.\n\n**1. Position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\n`θ₁ = 1.220 * λ / D = 1.220 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a`\n\n**2. Position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\n`θ₂ = 2.233 * λ / D = 2.233 * λ / (2a) = 1.1165 * λ / a`\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. This is the difference between their angular positions:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n`Δθ = (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)`\n`Δθ = (1.1165 - 0.610) * λ / a`\n`Δθ = 0.5065 * λ / a`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 0.500 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ / a\nD) 0.610 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5065 * λ / a` is best represented by option A, `0.506 λ / a`.\n\nTo verify with higher precision:\nWe use the direct formula involving the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(z)`, where `z₁ ≈ 3.8317` and `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`.\nThe minima are at `a * sin(θ_n) = (z_n / (2π)) * λ`.\nFor small angles, `θ_n = (z_n / (2πa)) * λ`.\n`θ₁ = (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n`θ₂ = (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = ((7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = (3.1839 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\nThis confirms that the coefficient is approximately 0.506 or 0.507, making A the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
