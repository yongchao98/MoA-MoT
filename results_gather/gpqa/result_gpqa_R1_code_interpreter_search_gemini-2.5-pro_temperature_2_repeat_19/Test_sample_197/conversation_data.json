    "Here's a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Chemical Equilibria:** The formation of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes from cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate ions can be described by a series of equilibria, represented by the overall stability constants (β). The species present in the solution are `Co²⁺`, `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Equations:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n    The concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free thiocyanate ion concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants (`βn`):\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n    Substituting these into the equation for `c(Co)` gives:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n4.  **Define the Fraction of the Desired Species:** The fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is denoted by `α₂`.\n    `α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions from the previous step:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the expression for `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Approximate the Free Ligand Concentration:**\n    The total cobalt concentration is `c(Co) = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M`.\n    The total thiocyanate concentration is `0.1 M`.\n    Since the total concentration of the ligand (`SCN⁻`) is 10 times greater than the total concentration of the metal ion (`Co²⁺`), it is a reasonable approximation to assume that the concentration of the free ligand `[SCN⁻]` is nearly equal to its total initial concentration.\n    Therefore, we assume `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M. This is a common simplification in such problems when the ligand is in excess.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Now, plug the given values into the formula for `α₂`:\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   `β₁` = 9\n    *   `β₂` = 40\n    *   `β₃` = 63\n    *   `β₄` = 16\n\n    First, calculate the denominator, let's call it `D`:\n    `D = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴`\n    `D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\n    `D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n    `D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n    `D = 2.3646`\n\n    Next, calculate the numerator, which corresponds to the `[Co(SCN)₂]` term in the denominator:\n    `Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n\n    Now, calculate `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = Numerator / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n7.  **Convert to Percentage:**\n    To get the percentage, multiply the fraction `α₂` by 100:\n    Percentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\n8.  **Final Check with a Python Script:** To ensure accuracy, the calculation can be performed using a short script.\n\n```python\n# Given values for the cobalt-thiocyanate system\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n# Assuming the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to the total concentration\nscn_conc = 0.1  # in M\n\n# The formula for the fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex (alpha_2) is:\n# alpha_2 = (beta2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + beta1*[SCN-] + beta2*[SCN-]^2 + beta3*[SCN-]^3 + beta4*[SCN-]^4)\n\n# Calculate the individual terms in the denominator\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = beta1 * scn_conc\nterm2 = beta2 * scn_conc**2\nterm3 = beta3 * scn_conc**3\nterm4 = beta4 * scn_conc**4\n\n# Sum the terms to get the denominator\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The numerator is the term for the desired complex\nnumerator = term2\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n>>>\n16.91618032648228\n<<<\nThe python code confirms that the calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate its mole fraction relative to all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Define the species in equilibrium:**\nThe cobalt(II) ions, Co²⁺, react with thiocyanate ions, SCN⁻, to form a series of complexes:\n*   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺` (β₁)\n*   `Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]` (β₂)\n*   `Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (β₃)\n*   `Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (β₄)\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**2. Express complex concentrations using stability constants:**\nThe concentrations of the complexes can be written in terms of the free `[Co²⁺]`, free `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants (β):\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nSubstituting these into the total cobalt concentration equation gives:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Define the fraction of the desired complex (`α₂`):**\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `α₂`, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions from step 2:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the formula:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**4. Approximate the free ligand concentration:**\nThe total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is 10 times larger than the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M). Because the ligand is in large excess, we can approximate that the concentration of free thiocyanate, `[SCN⁻]`, is equal to its total initial concentration.\n`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n**5. Calculate the numerical value:**\nWe use the provided values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nLet's calculate the denominator (`D`):\n`D = 1 + (9 * 0.1¹) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\n`D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n`D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n`D = 2.3646`\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator (`N`), which corresponds to the `[Co(SCN)₂]` term in the denominator:\n`N = β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n\nFinally, calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = N / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**6. Convert to percentage:**\nPercentage = `α₂ * 100 = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe Python code output `16.91618032648228` confirms this calculation.\n\nThe percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
