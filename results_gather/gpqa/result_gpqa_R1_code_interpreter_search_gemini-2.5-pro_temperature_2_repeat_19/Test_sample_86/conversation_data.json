    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Decipher the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituent groups attached to it.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. This means the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR ... presence of a carbonyl group (C=O)\"**: One of the substituents contains a carbonyl group.\n*   **\"FTIR ... presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. Let's denote this as -X.\n\nNow let's combine these facts to build the structure:\n*   We have a halogen (-X) on the ring.\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. Possible structures for this second substituent are:\n    *   An acetyl group: -C(=O)CH₃. This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. This fits.\n    *   A formylmethyl group: -CH₂CHO. This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. This also fits.\n    *   An ester like methoxycarbonyl: -COOCH₃. This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. This also fits.\n\nSo, the potential molecules are a halo-acetophenone (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃), a halophenyl-acetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), or a methyl halo-benzoate (X-C₆H₄-COOCH₃).\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data Options**\n\nLet's focus on the signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5 - 8.5 ppm) first.\n\n*   **Option A**: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)\n*   **Option B**: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)\n*   **Option C**: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d) - The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the aromatic region. This option is incorrect.\n*   **Option D**: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d) - There are no signals in the aromatic region. This option is incorrect.\n\nBoth options A and B show a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This is the classic signature of a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. In this arrangement, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, resulting in only two types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n\nSo, we know our compound has the structure `para-X-C₆H₄-R`.\n\n**3. Evaluate Options A and B against the Possible Structures**\n\n*   **Structure 1: para-haloacetophenone (p-X-C₆H₄-COCH₃)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: We expect two doublets, each for 2H. This matches both A and B. Both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing, which would shift the aromatic protons downfield (to higher ppm values), consistent with the ~7.6-7.8 ppm shifts.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons**: We have a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a carbonyl. This group is isolated from other protons, so it should appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift is around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n\n*   **Structure 2: para-halophenylacetaldehyde (p-X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: We expect two doublets, each for 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons**: We have two sets of protons:\n        *   An aldehyde proton (-CHO): This is highly deshielded, appears far downfield (~9.5-10 ppm), and should be a **triplet (t)** due to splitting by the adjacent -CH₂ group. It integrates to **1H**.\n        *   A methylene group (-CH₂-): This appears around ~3.5-4.0 ppm and should be a **doublet (d)** due to splitting by the -CHO proton. It integrates to **2H**.\n\n**4. Match the NMR Data to the Best Structure**\n\nLet's re-examine options A and B:\n\n*   **Option A) `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`**\n    *   This data seems to describe the aldehyde structure (`p-X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO`). The 9.9 ppm signal matches the aldehyde proton, and the 3.7 ppm signal matches the methylene group.\n    *   **However, there are two major problems:**\n        1.  **Multiplicity**: Both the aldehyde proton and the methylene protons are listed as singlets (`s`). They are adjacent and must split each other, so they should be a triplet and a doublet, respectively.\n        2.  **Aromatic Shift**: The aromatic shifts (7.6-7.8 ppm) are too high (too downfield) for a molecule with a -CH₂CHO group. This group is not strongly electron-withdrawing enough to cause such a large shift.\n\n*   **Option B) `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`**\n    *   This data perfectly matches the ketone structure (`p-X-C₆H₄-COCH₃`).\n    *   The `2.3 (3H, s)` signal is exactly what we expect for the methyl protons of an acetyl group (-COCH₃): a singlet for 3 protons at ~2.3 ppm.\n    *   The `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` signals are consistent with a para-substituted ring containing a strongly electron-withdrawing acetyl group, which deshields the protons and shifts them downfield.\n    *   The integration (2H + 2H + 3H = 7 total protons) and multiplicities are all chemically correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is a para-haloacetophenone. Option B provides the 1H NMR data that is fully consistent with this structure in terms of chemical shifts, integration, and multiplicity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
