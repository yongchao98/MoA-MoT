    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   We have two inertial frames of reference.\n    *   **Frame S (Laboratory Frame):** This is the frame where the observer is stationary. In this frame, the glass is observed to be moving with a constant velocity `v`.\n    *   **Frame S' (Glass's Rest Frame):** This is the frame that is moving along with the glass. In this frame, the glass is stationary.\n\n2.  **Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame (S'):**\n    *   The index of refraction `n` of a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in that medium (`v_medium`), as measured in the medium's own rest frame.\n    *   So, `n = c / v_medium`.\n    *   The speed of light inside the glass, as measured by an observer in the S' frame (at rest with the glass), is `u' = c / n`.\n    *   The problem states that we should take `c = 1`. Therefore, the speed of light in the S' frame is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Lorentz Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    *   The problem requires us to find the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). To do this, we need to transform the velocity `u'` from the S' frame to the S frame.\n    *   The relativistic formula for velocity addition is:\n        `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    *   Where:\n        *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in frame S (what we want to find).\n        *   `u'` is the velocity of the object in frame S' (`1/n`).\n        *   `v` is the velocity of frame S' relative to frame S (the velocity of the glass, `v`).\n        *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum (`1`).\n    *   The glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, so `v` and `u'` are in the same direction, and we can use the signs as they are.\n\n4.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    *   Substitute the values `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the velocity addition formula:\n        `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `u = ( 1/n + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n    *   To eliminate the complex fraction, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n        `u = n * ( 1/n + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    *   Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n        `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n    *   `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
