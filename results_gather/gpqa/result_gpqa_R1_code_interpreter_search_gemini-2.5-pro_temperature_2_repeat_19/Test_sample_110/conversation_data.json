    "*   **Analysis of Reaction A**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, bulky base that will deprotonate the starting ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   **Reactants:**\n        *   **Ketone (Nucleophile precursor):** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This ketone has two α-carbons, C-2 and C-6.\n            *   C-2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group), so it has no α-protons.\n            *   C-6 has one methyl group and one α-proton.\n        *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n        *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK).\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The t-BuOK base will abstract the only available α-proton from C-6 of the ketone, forming a specific enolate. The double bond of the enolate forms between C-1 and C-6.\n        2.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate nucleophile attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n        3.  **Protonation/Work-up:** An intermediate enolate is formed from the ethyl acrylate part, which is then protonated during the work-up step (often by the t-butanol formed in the first step or by added acid/water) to give the final product.\n    *   **Product Structure (A):**\n        *   The original ketone ring remains intact.\n        *   A new substituent, `—CH2CH2COOEt` (an ethyl propanoate group), is attached to C-6 of the ring.\n        *   The full structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a C=O at C-1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C-2, a methyl group at C-6, and the newly added `—CH2CH2COOEt` group also at C-6.\n    *   **Product Naming:** The options name the product with ethyl propanoate as the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent. Let's analyze this naming convention:\n        *   Parent chain: ethyl propanoate (`EtOOC-CH2(2)-CH2(3)-`). The substituent is on C-3.\n        *   Substituent: The cyclohexanone ring. According to IUPAC rules for naming substituents, the point of attachment is designated as C-1'. So, C-1' of the ring is the former C-6 of the starting ketone.\n        *   Numbering the ring substituent: We number to give the principal functional group (the ketone's C=O) the lowest possible number.\n            *   C-1' is the point of attachment and has a methyl group.\n            *   C-2' must be the C=O group (the former C-1).\n            *   C-3' has the ethyl and methyl groups (the former C-2).\n        *   Putting the name together: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. This name correctly describes the connectivity of the product. Thus, Product A matches the name given in options C and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction B**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   **Reactants:**\n        *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH3CH2CH2NO2). The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the protons on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon, C-1) acidic.\n        *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH3CH=CHCN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n        *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Carbanion Formation:** KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n        2.  **Michael Addition:** The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The β-carbon is the C-3 atom in the `CH3(4)-CH(3)=CH(2)-CN(1)` chain.\n        3.  **Protonation/Work-up:** The resulting nitrile enolate is protonated by water (H2O) to yield the final product.\n    *   **Product Structure (B):**\n        *   A new C-C bond forms between C-1 of the nitropropane and C-3 of the butenenitrile.\n        *   The resulting structure is `CH3CH2-CH(NO2) - CH(CH3) - CH2-CN`.\n    *   **Product Naming:** We identify the principal functional group (nitrile, -CN) and the longest carbon chain containing it.\n        *   The chain is `CH3(6)-CH2(5)-CH(4)(NO2)-CH(3)(CH3)-CH2(2)-CN(1)`.\n        *   The parent chain is a hexanenitrile.\n        *   There is a nitro group at C-4 and a methyl group at C-3.\n        *   The IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   **Carbon Count Check:** Reactant 1 (1-nitropropane) has 3 carbons. Reactant 2 (but-2-enenitrile) has 4 carbons. The product must have 3 + 4 = 7 carbons.\n        *   Our predicted product B, `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`, has a 6-carbon chain (hexanenitrile) plus a 1-carbon methyl group, for a total of 7 carbons. This is correct.\n        *   The other option for B, `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`, has a 4-carbon chain (butanenitrile) plus two 1-carbon methyl groups, for a total of 6 carbons. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    *   Product A is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   Product B is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n    *   This combination matches the descriptions in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
