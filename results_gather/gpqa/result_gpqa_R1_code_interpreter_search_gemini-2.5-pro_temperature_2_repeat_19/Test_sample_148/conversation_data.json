    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data provided:**\n    *   **Â¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   There are two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   The total integral for these two peaks is 1H, which is what you'd expect for one proton. The integrals of the two peaks are roughly equal.\n        *   This indicates the presence of two different, but structurally very similar, chemical species in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n        *   The two species must provide different chemical environments for that alpha-proton, causing it to have two different chemical shifts.\n        *   Simple spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause.\n\n    *   **LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry):**\n        *   **LC part:** The chromatogram shows two separate peaks with equal intensities. This confirms the presence of two distinct compounds that can be separated based on their different physical/chemical properties (like polarity), which dictates their interaction with the chromatography column. The equal intensities support the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR. The fact they separate even at *elevated temperature* suggests they are stable isomers, not conformers that would interconvert and coalesce into a single peak at high temperatures (or that the energy barrier to interconversion is very high).\n        *   **MS part:** The mass spectrum for *both* LC peaks is identical and matches the expected mass of the target peptide. This is a critical piece of information. It means the two compounds are not a precursor/product or an impurity with a different chemical formula. They must have the same molecular formula and therefore the same molecular weight.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options based on the experimental evidence:**\n\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** In peptide synthesis, \"double coupling\" refers to repeating a coupling step to drive the reaction to completion. This would increase the yield of the single *desired product* and would not result in a stable mixture of two different compounds. This option doesn't explain any of the observations.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would give a single, identical spectrum. You would *not* see two separate peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC:** On a standard (achiral) chromatography column, enantiomers co-elute, meaning they would appear as a *single* peak, not two.\n        *   This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor is a starting material or intermediate from an earlier step in the synthesis. It would have a different chemical structure and, crucially, a different molecular formula and mass. The mass spectrometry data, which shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the final product, directly refutes this explanation.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have multiple chiral centers, with at least one differing in configuration while at least one other is the same. A common example in peptide synthesis is epimerization, where an L-amino acid center inverts to a D-amino acid center, creating a diastereomer (e.g., L-Ala-L-Phe vs. L-Ala-D-Phe). Another common source in peptides is *cis/trans* isomerism about a peptide bond (especially with proline), creating rotamers, which are a class of diastereoisomers.\n        *   **Physical/Chemical Properties:** Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct molecules, their NMR spectra are different. A mixture of diastereoisomers would show two sets of peaks. The observation of two peaks for the alpha-proton fits this perfectly.\n        *   **LC:** Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated on a standard (achiral) chromatography column. The observation of two separate LC peaks fits this perfectly.\n        *   **MS:** Because they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight. The observation that both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum consistent with the product fits this perfectly.\n        *   This option is consistent with all pieces of experimental evidence.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of two separable compounds (LC) with the same mass (MS) but distinct NMR signals points unequivocally to the presence of isomers. Since they are distinguishable by achiral chromatography and NMR, they must be diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<D>>>"
