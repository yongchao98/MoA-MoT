    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. The nature of this radiation can be understood through a multipole expansion. The power radiated is typically dominated by the lowest-order non-vanishing multipole moment.\n\n**1. Identifying the Radiating System**\n\n*   The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is \"spheroid in shape\" with a \"symmetry axis along the z-axis.\"\n*   This generic description can encompass several physical scenarios. However, unless specific symmetries forbid it, the most dominant form of radiation will be electric dipole radiation.\n*   Let's model the system as an oscillating electric dipole. This occurs, for example, if charges oscillate back and forth along the symmetry (z) axis. This is the most fundamental mode of radiation and is a standard assumption in such problems unless specified otherwise (e.g., by stating that the dipole moment is zero).\n\n**2. Electric Dipole Radiation Pattern (Angular Dependence)**\n\n*   For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis with moment `p(t) = p₀ cos(ωt)`, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis), and `K` is a constant that depends on the dipole moment amplitude, frequency, and fundamental constants.\n\n*   The function `f(λ, θ)` in the question corresponds to this `dP/dΩ`.\n\n*   The power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n\n*   The maximum radiated power is given as `A`. So, we can write:\n    `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = K * sin²(90°) = K * 1 = K`\n\n*   Therefore, the power at any angle `θ` is:\n    `dP/dΩ = A * sin²(θ)`\n\n**3. Calculating the Fraction at θ = 30°**\n\n*   We need to find the fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n*   Power at 30°: `(dP/dΩ)|_(θ=30°) = A * sin²(30°)`.\n*   We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n*   So, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n*   The power at 30° is `A * (1/4) = A/4`.\n*   The fraction of `A` is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\nTo confirm this simple calculation, we can use Python.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Angle in degrees\ntheta_degrees = 30\n\n# Convert angle to radians for the sin function\ntheta_radians = math.radians(theta_degrees)\n\n# The angular dependence of power is sin^2(theta).\n# The maximum power corresponds to sin^2(90) = 1.\n# The fraction of maximum power at a given angle theta is sin^2(theta).\nfraction = math.sin(theta_radians)**2\n\nprint(f\"The fraction of maximum power at {theta_degrees} degrees is {fraction:.2f}, which is 1/4.\")\n```\n\n**4. Determining the Wavelength Dependence (Functional Form of f)**\n\n*   The radiated power's dependence on wavelength `λ` is contained in the constant `K`. The full formula for the power per solid angle is:\n    `dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32π²ε₀c³) * sin²(θ)`\n*   The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πc/λ`.\n*   Therefore, the power is proportional to `ω⁴`:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n*   This `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of Rayleigh scattering and electric dipole radiation.\n*   So, a possible form for the function `f(λ, θ)` includes a `λ⁻⁴` term.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\n*   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n*   A possible form for the function `f`, which describes the power radiated per unit solid angle, is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n*   Combining these two results, we look for the option that has `1/4` and `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n*Alternative Consideration (Quadrupole Radiation):*\nIf one were to interpret \"oscillating spheroid\" as an oscillation in the spheroid's shape itself (e.g., from prolate to oblate), the system might have a zero dipole moment but a non-zero, oscillating electric quadrupole moment. In this case:\n*   `dP/dΩ ∝ λ⁻⁶ * sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`.\n*   The maximum power `A` would be at `θ = 45°`.\n*   The fraction at `θ = 30°` would be `[sin²(30)cos²(30)] / [sin²(45)cos²(45)] = [(1/4)(3/4)] / [(1/2)(1/2)] = (3/16)/(1/4) = 3/4`.\n*   This corresponds to option B (`3/4, λ⁻⁶`).\nHowever, in the absence of information forcing the dipole moment to be zero, standard physics practice is to assume the lowest-order (and typically dominant) radiation mechanism is present, which is the electric dipole.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An oscillating charge distribution that is spheroid in shape with a symmetry axis along the z-axis can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The radiation from such a dipole is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism.\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` for an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is given by the formula:\n`dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)`\nwhere `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis), and `K` is a constant that depends on the frequency and the amplitude of the dipole moment.\n\nThe problem states that the maximum radiated power is `A`. The `sin²(θ)` term is maximized when `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the xy-plane, perpendicular to the oscillation axis). At this angle, `sin²(90°) = 1`.\nTherefore, the maximum power `A` is:\n`A = (dP/dΩ)_max = K * sin²(90°) = K * 1 = K`\n\nSo, we can express the power radiated at any angle `θ` in terms of `A`:\n`dP/dΩ = A * sin²(θ)`\n\nWe need to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We calculate the power at this angle:\n`Power at 30° = A * sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`. Therefore:\n`Power at 30° = A * (1/2)² = A * (1/4)`\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power `A` is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe constant `K` in the power formula is not just a number; it includes the dependence on the oscillation frequency (`ω`) and thus the wavelength (`λ`). The full formula shows that the total radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency:\n`P ∝ ω⁴`\n\nSince the frequency and wavelength are related by `ω = 2πc/λ` (where `c` is the speed of light), the power dependence on wavelength is:\n`P ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of electric dipole radiation and is also the reason for Rayleigh scattering (which makes the sky blue).\n\nThe function `f` from the problem represents the power per unit solid angle `dP/dΩ`, which has the same wavelength dependence as the total power. Thus, a possible form for `f` involves a `λ⁻⁴` term.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the function `f(λ, θ)` describing the power dependence is proportional to **`λ⁻⁴`**.\n\nMatching these findings with the given options, we find that option C is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
