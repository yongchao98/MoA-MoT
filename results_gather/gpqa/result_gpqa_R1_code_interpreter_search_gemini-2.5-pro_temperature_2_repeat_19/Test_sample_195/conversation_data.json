    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n### 1. Define the System and Conservation of Energy\n\nWe consider a particle of rest mass $m$ subject to a harmonic potential. The total energy $E_{total}$ of a relativistic particle in a potential field $U(x)$ is the sum of its relativistic energy and potential energy. This total energy is conserved.\n\nThe relativistic energy of the particle is $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor, $v$ is the speed of the particle, and $c$ is the speed of light. Note that the relativistic energy includes the rest energy $mc^2$.\n\nThe force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ is obtained by integrating the negative of the force with respect to position:\n$U(x) = -\\int_0^x F(x') dx' = -\\int_0^x (-kx') dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\nThe total conserved energy of the system is:\n$E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n### 2. Identify Key States of Motion\n\nWe can find the maximum speed by applying the conservation of energy principle between two specific points in the oscillator's motion:\n\n*   **State 1: Maximum displacement (turning point)**\n    At the maximum amplitude, $x = A$, the particle is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n    At this point, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The total energy is:\n    $E_{total, 1} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n*   **State 2: Equilibrium position**\n    The speed is maximum ($v = v_{max}$) when the particle passes through the equilibrium position, $x=0$. At this point, the potential energy is zero, $U(0) = 0$.\n    The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy is:\n    $E_{total, 2} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + U(0) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation of Energy and Solve for v_max\n\nSince energy is conserved, $E_{total, 1} = E_{total, 2}$.\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$:\n\n1.  Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\n2.  To isolate the square root term, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$.\n\n3.  Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$.\n\n4.  Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$.\n\n5.  Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$.\n\n### 4. Compare with Options\n\nThis derived expression matches option B.\n\n$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n<<<B>>>"
