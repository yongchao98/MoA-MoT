    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **1. Understand the System and Basic Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey this principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its energy level (principal quantum number `n`) and its spin projection (`m_s`, which can be +1/2 for \"spin up\" or -1/2 for \"spin down\"). This means each spatial energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n*   **Energy Levels:** The system is a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are given by:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    The problem provides the base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    So, the single-particle energy levels are:\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n    *   ...and so on.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_gs)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1:** Can hold two particles (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy contributed: $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times E = 2E$.\n*   **Level n=2:** We have two particles left. This level can also hold two particles.\n    *   Energy contributed: $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:** We sum the energies of all four particles.\n    *   $E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\nThe configuration of the ground state is two particles in the n=1 level and two particles in the n=2 level.\n\n### **3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the lowest-energy configuration possible above the ground state. We create it by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two in n=2.\n*   **Highest Occupied Level:** n=2.\n*   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** n=3.\n*   **Promotion:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **New Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    *   $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n    *   $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider different possibilities for excitation from the ground state and find the one with the lowest energy after the first excited state.\n\nLet's evaluate the energies of possible configurations:\n\n*   **Ground State:** (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2) -> Energy = **10E**\n*   **First Excited State:** (2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3) -> Energy = **15E**\n\nNow let's consider other excitations:\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to the lowest empty state (n=3).\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = \\bf{18E}$.\n\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = \\bf{20E}$.\n\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4 (skipping n=3).\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = \\bf{22E}$.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the Second Excited State has an energy of **18E**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
