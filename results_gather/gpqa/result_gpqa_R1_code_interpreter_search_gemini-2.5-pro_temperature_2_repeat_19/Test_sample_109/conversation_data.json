    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Observational Constraints for Both Telescopes**\n\nFor a star to be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory, it must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  It must be visible in the sky from both locations (Declination check).\n2.  It must be bright enough to be detected by both instruments (Apparent Magnitude check).\n\n**A. Declination (Sky Visibility) Constraint**\n\nAn observatory can observe stars from the North Celestial Pole (+90° declination) down to a southern limit, and from the South Celestial Pole (-90° declination) up to a northern limit. We are told to disregard elevation limits, so we assume an observatory at latitude `lat` can see any object with a declination `dec` that rises above the horizon.\n*   For a northern observatory (latitude `lat_N`), an object never rises if its declination is less than `lat_N - 90°`.\n*   For a southern observatory (latitude `lat_S`), an object never rises if its declination is greater than `lat_S + 90°`.\n\nLet's find the latitudes:\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory:** Located in Hawaii at a latitude of approximately +19.8° N.\n    *   It can observe stars with declination `dec > 19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`.\n*   **Paranal Observatory:** Located in Chile at a latitude of approximately -24.6° S.\n    *   It can observe stars with declination `dec < -24.6° + 90° = +65.4°`.\n\nFor a star to be visible from **BOTH** observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range:\n**-70.2° < Declination < +65.4°**\n\n**B. Apparent Magnitude Constraint**\n\n*   ESPRESSO (Paranal) can observe stars with apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) < 17.\n*   HIRES (Keck) can observe stars with `m_V` < 16.\n\nTo be detected by **BOTH**, a star must satisfy the stricter of the two limits. Therefore, the star's apparent V magnitude must be:\n**m_V < 16.0**\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Star**\n\nNow we will check each star against these two combined constraints (Declination and Magnitude). When the apparent magnitude `m_V` is not given, we calculate it using the distance modulus formula, including extinction `A_V`:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nwhere `M_V` is the absolute V magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc), and `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n---\n\n**Star 1:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = -75°.\n*   *Check:* Is -70.2° < -75° < +65.4°? No, -75° is too far south and is not visible from Keck.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not detectable by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 2:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = +55°.\n*   *Check:* Is -70.2° < +55° < +65.4°? Yes.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** `m_V` = 16.5 mag.\n*   *Check:* Is 16.5 < 16.0? No, it is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not detectable by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 3:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = +48°.\n*   *Check:* Is -70.2° < +48° < +65.4°? Yes.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** `m_V` = 15.5 mag. The problem gives the final apparent magnitude directly. The other information (E(B-V), distance) is likely extra data not needed for this check.\n*   *Check:* Is 15.5 < 16.0? Yes.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable by both.**\n\n---\n\n**Star 4:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = -48°.\n*   *Check:* Is -70.2° < -48° < +65.4°? Yes.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** We need to calculate it.\n    *   `M_V` = 15.5 mag\n    *   `d` = 10 pc\n    *   `A_V` = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   `m_V` = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24\n    *   `m_V` = 15.5 + (5 * 1) - 5 + 1.24\n    *   `m_V` = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag\n*   *Check:* Is 16.74 < 16.0? No.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not detectable by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 5:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = +60°.\n*   *Check:* Is -70.2° < +60° < +65.4°? Yes.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** We need to calculate it.\n    *   `M_V` = 16.5 mag\n    *   `d` = 5 pc\n    *   `A_V` = 0 (since E(B-V) is not mentioned)\n    *   `m_V` = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 + 0\n    *   `m_V` = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5\n    *   `m_V` = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag\n*   *Check:* Is 14.995 < 16.0? Yes.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable by both.**\n\n---\n\n**3. Final Answer**\n\nThe stars that satisfy both the declination and magnitude criteria for joint observation are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
