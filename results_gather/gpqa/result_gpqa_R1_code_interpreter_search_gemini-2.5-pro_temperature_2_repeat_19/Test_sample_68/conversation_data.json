    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics\nThe problem involves a relativistic particle ($X^0$) decaying in a bubble chamber. The key concepts are:\n*   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$):** The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame.\n*   **Time Dilation:** From the laboratory's frame of reference, the particle's lifetime appears longer due to its high speed. This dilated lifetime ($\\tau$) is given by $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor quantifies the relativistic effects and is calculated from the particle's total energy (E) and rest mass energy ($m_0 c^2$) as $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2}$.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle survives for a time `t` (in the lab frame) is $P(t) = e^{-t/\\tau}$.\n*   **Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The average distance a particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is the mean decay length, $\\lambda$. It's calculated as $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$, where `v` is the particle's velocity. For highly relativistic particles ($v \\approx c$), this is often expressed as $\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n*   **Detector Resolution:** To \"observe\" a decay, the detector must be able to resolve the track of the particle $X^0$. This means the particle must travel a distance `d` that is greater than the detector's minimum resolution, `d_res`. If it travels less than `d_res`, the decay point is indistinguishable from the creation point.\n\n### 2. Interpret the Question\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\".\nThis means we need to find a resolution distance, let's call it `d_res`, such that the fraction of particles traveling a distance `d` greater than or equal to `d_res` is 30%.\n\nThe probability of a particle traveling a distance `d` before decaying is described by the probability of it \"surviving\" to that distance. The probability of survival to a distance `d` is given by $P(d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$.\nWe need to find `d_res` such that:\n$P(d \\ge d_{res}) = 0.30$\nThis translates to the equation:\n$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\n### 3. Plan the Calculation\n1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, using the given energy and mass.\n2.  Calculate the mean decay length, $\\lambda$.\n3.  Solve the probability equation for the required resolution, `d_res`.\n\n### 4. Execute the Calculation\n\nI will use a python script for precise calculation.\n\n**Given values:**\n*   Total Energy, E = 27 GeV\n*   Rest mass of $X^0$, $m_0 c^2$ = 3.41 GeV\n*   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   Observation probability = 30% or 0.30\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length is given by the formula $\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the minimum resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nFrom the condition $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{d_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\nNow, let's compute the numerical value.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE = 27.0  # GeV\nm0 = 3.41  # GeV/c^2\ntau0 = 8e-16  # s\nc = 299792458.0  # m/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma\ngamma = E / m0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length lambda\n# lambda = v * tau = (beta*c) * (gamma*tau0) = c * tau0 * (beta*gamma)\n# where beta*gamma = sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\nbeta_gamma = np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\nmean_decay_length = c * tau0 * beta_gamma\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the minimum resolution d_res\n# We want to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n# The probability of a particle traveling a distance d or more is P(d) = exp(-d / lambda).\n# We set P(d_res) = 0.30\n# exp(-d_res / lambda) = 0.30\n# -d_res / lambda = ln(0.30)\n# d_res = -lambda * ln(0.30)\nresolution = -mean_decay_length * np.log(0.30)\n\nprint(f\"{resolution:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n2.27e-06\n\nThe calculation yields a result of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters.\n\n### 5. Final Answer\nComparing the calculated result with the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\nThe value $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is closest to option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The minor discrepancy might be due to slightly different values for the speed of light `c` or rounding in the problem's intended calculation, but the order of magnitude and the leading digits are consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the physics and calculations involved:\n\n**1. Relativistic Effects:**\n\n*   Since the particle $X^0$ is moving at a very high energy (27 GeV) compared to its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), its lifetime in the laboratory frame will be significantly longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). This effect is known as time dilation.\n*   The factor by which time is dilated is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n\n**2. Calculating the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy (E) to the rest mass energy ($m_0 c^2$).\n\n*   E = 27 GeV\n*   $m_0 c^2$ = 3.41 GeV\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**3. Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is calculated as the particle's velocity (v) multiplied by its dilated lifetime ($\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$). For highly relativistic particles, the velocity is very close to the speed of light (c).\n\nA precise formula is: $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot (\\beta\\gamma)$\nWhere $\\beta = v/c$. We can use the identity $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\n*   c (speed of light) $\\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   $\\tau_0$ (proper lifetime) = $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $\\gamma \\approx 7.918$\n\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{7.918^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda = (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n$\\lambda = (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{61.69}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}) \\cdot 7.854 \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**4. Determining the Minimum Resolution:**\n\n*   The question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means we want the track length `d` to be at least as long as the resolution `d_res`.\n*   The decay of particles follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance `d` or more is given by $P(d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$.\n*   We need to find the distance `d_res` for which this probability is 30% (or 0.30).\n\n$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nTo solve for `d_res`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n$-\\frac{d_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\nUsing the value of $\\lambda$ we calculated and $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n\n$d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n$d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThis is the minimum distance the particle must travel to be considered an \"observed\" decay in this context.\n\n**5. Comparing with Options:**\n\n*   Calculated resolution: $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n*   Option A: 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n*   Option B: 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n*   Option C: 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n*   Option D: 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\nThe calculated value $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is very close to option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The slight difference is likely due to rounding or the use of slightly different physical constants in the problem's formulation. Option D is the correct choice based on the calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
