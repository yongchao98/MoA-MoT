    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the solution.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions ($PO_4^{3-}$) in a solution containing known amounts of $KH_2PO_4$ and $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components and Their Roles:**\n    *   $KH_2PO_4$ is a salt that completely dissociates in water to give $K^+$ and dihydrogen phosphate ions, $H_2PO_4^-$.\n    *   $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$ is a salt that completely dissociates in water to give $2Na^+$ and hydrogen phosphate ions, $HPO_4^{2-}$.\n    *   $H_2PO_4^-$ is a weak acid.\n    *   $HPO_4^{2-}$ is its conjugate base.\n    *   Together, they form a buffer solution. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid ($H_3PO_4$):\n        $H_2PO_4^- \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + HPO_4^{2-}$ with the acid dissociation constant $K_{a2} = 6.2 \\times 10^{-8}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Initial Molar Concentrations:**\n    *   First, calculate the moles of each substance.\n        *   Moles of $H_2PO_4^-$ (from $KH_2PO_4$):\n            Mass = 1.00 g\n            Molar Mass (Mw) of $KH_2PO_4$ = 136.09 g/mol\n            Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles\n        *   Moles of $HPO_4^{2-}$ (from $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$):\n            Mass = 1.00 g\n            Molar Mass (Mw) of $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$ = 177.99 g/mol\n            Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles\n\n    *   Next, calculate the initial concentrations in the 200.00 cm³ (0.20000 L) solution.\n        *   Initial concentration of $H_2PO_4^-$: $[H_2PO_4^-]_i$ = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n        *   Initial concentration of $HPO_4^{2-}$: $[HPO_4^{2-}]_i$ = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n4.  **Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration $[H^+]$:**\n    *   The solution is a buffer governed by the $K_{a2}$ equilibrium. The equilibrium expression is:\n        $K_{a2} = \\frac{[H^+][HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H_2PO_4^-]}$\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for $[H^+]$:\n        $[H^+] = K_{a2} \\times \\frac{[H_2PO_4^-]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}$\n    *   For a buffer, we can approximate the equilibrium concentrations with the initial concentrations:\n        $[H^+] \\approx (6.2 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times \\frac{0.03674}{0.02809} \\approx 8.11 \\times 10^{-8}$ M\n\n5.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration $[PO_4^{3-}]$:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion, $PO_4^{3-}$, is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion, $HPO_4^{2-}$. This is governed by the third dissociation constant, $K_{a3}$:\n        $HPO_4^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + PO_4^{3-}$ with $K_{a3} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-12}$.\n    *   The equilibrium expression for this reaction is:\n        $K_{a3} = \\frac{[H^+][PO_4^{3-}]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}$\n    *   We can rearrange this equation to solve for the unknown, $[PO_4^{3-}]$:\n        $[PO_4^{3-}] = K_{a3} \\times \\frac{[HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H^+]}$\n    *   Now, substitute the known and calculated values into this equation. We use the calculated $[H^+]$ and the initial concentration of $[HPO_4^{2-}]$ (because its dissociation is negligible due to the very small $K_{a3}$ value and the presence of H+ from the buffer).\n        $[PO_4^{3-}] = (1.8 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times \\frac{0.02809 \\text{ M}}{8.11 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ M}} \\approx 6.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n6.  **Code-assisted Calculation and Verification:** To ensure accuracy and avoid rounding errors during manual calculation, a Python script can be used.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses and given quantities\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume = 0.20000  # L\n\n# Dissociation constants\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [H+] using the buffer equation for Ka2\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate [PO4^3-] using the equation for Ka3\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nPO4_3minus_conc = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{PO4_3minus_conc:.3e}\")\n```\nThe output from the code is `6.236e-07`, which is $6.236 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n7.  **Final Comparison:** The calculated value of $6.236 \\times 10^{-7}$ M is closest to option B.
