    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers can interconvert by a chemical reaction called tautomerization. A common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure is `(-C(=O)-CH2-)` repeated three times in a ring. Each methylene group (`-CH2-`) is located between two carbonyl groups (`C=O`). The hydrogen atoms on these methylene groups are α-hydrogens. They are particularly acidic and can easily move to an adjacent oxygen atom, forming an enol. In fact, this compound exists predominantly in its tautomeric form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is stabilized by aromaticity. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):** This molecule consists of a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no α-hydrogens, keto-enol tautomerism cannot occur. Therefore, benzoquinone *does not* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of a chiral molecule is the presence of a chiral center, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is `CH3-CH(OH)-C(=O)OCH3`. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    Since this carbon atom is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is `CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3`. This is a planar molecule (around the C=C bond) and possesses a plane of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It does show geometric isomerism, being the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate).\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n*   **Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is benzoquinone.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n    *   This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
