    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid.**\n\n*   First, find the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) before dilution.\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume\n    *   Moles = 0.05 mol/L × (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.0010 mol\n*   Next, calculate the new volume after adding water.\n    *   New Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n*   Now, find the new concentration of the diluted acetic acid.\n    *   New Concentration = Moles / New Volume\n    *   New Concentration = 0.0010 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-), and 75% remains as acetic acid. This creates a buffer solution.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka.\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) = 4.73\n*   In a buffer, the ratio of concentrations ([conjugate base]/[acid]) is equal to the ratio of their moles.\n    *   Ratio = (25% reacted) / (75% remaining) = 25/75 = 1/3\n*   Now, calculate the pH.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.48 = 4.25\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n\n*   First, determine the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point, where all the acid has been neutralized.\n    *   Moles of Acid = Moles of Base\n    *   0.0010 mol CH3COOH = Concentration of NaOH × Volume of NaOH\n    *   Volume of NaOH = 0.0010 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   At the equivalence point, all the 0.0010 mol of CH3COOH has been converted to 0.0010 mol of its conjugate base, CH3COO-.\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point.\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH3COO-).\n    *   [CH3COO⁻] = 0.0010 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and hydrolyzes in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n    *   CH3COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH3COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) = 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   We can set up an ICE table to find the [OH⁻] at equilibrium.\n    *   Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.082 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) = 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Now, calculate the pOH and then the pH.\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) = 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\nTo confirm the calculations:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Calculation for pH at 25% titration ---\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Calculation for pH at equivalence point ---\n# Initial moles of acetic acid\nmoles_acid = 0.05 * 0.020\n# Volume of diluted acid\nvolume_diluted_acid = 0.020 + 0.020\n# Volume of NaOH needed for equivalence\nvolume_NaOH_eq = moles_acid / 0.1\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_volume_eq = volume_diluted_acid + volume_NaOH_eq\n# Concentration of acetate at equivalence point\nacetate_concentration = moles_acid / total_volume_eq\n\n# Calculate Kb\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Solve for [OH-] using Kb = x^2 / [acetate]\n# x = [OH-]\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * acetate_concentration)\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n```\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "**Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n**Part 1: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Initial State & Dilution:**\n    *   We start with 20.00 cm³ (0.0200 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = Volume × Molarity = 0.0200 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.0010 mol.\n    *   This is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, making the new total volume 40.00 cm³ (0.0400 L).\n    *   The new concentration of acetic acid is: [CH₃COOH] = Moles / New Volume = 0.0010 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **Titration Reaction:**\n    *   NaOH reacts with CH₃COOH in a 1:1 ratio:\n        CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n\n3.  **25% Titration Point:**\n    *   At this point, 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acid remains unreacted.\n    *   This creates a buffer solution containing both a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n\n4.  **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:**\n    *   To find the pH of a buffer, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        pH = pKa + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )\n        where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n    *   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n        pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.7328\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of moles (and therefore concentrations) of [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75 or 1/3.\n    *   Substitute the values into the equation:\n        pH = 4.7328 + log(1/3)\n        pH = 4.7328 + (-0.4771)\n        pH ≈ 4.2557 ≈ **4.26**\n\n**Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Equivalence Point Definition:**\n    *   This is the point where all the initial acetic acid (0.0010 mol) has been completely neutralized by the NaOH. The only species affecting the pH is the product, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which dissociates into Na⁺ (a spectator ion) and the conjugate base CH₃COO⁻.\n\n2.  **Volume of NaOH Added:**\n    *   Moles of NaOH needed = Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.0010 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.0010 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L or 10.00 cm³.\n\n3.  **Solution Composition at Equivalence:**\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ (0.0500 L).\n    *   Moles of acetate (CH₃COO⁻) produced = 0.0010 mol.\n    *   Concentration of acetate: [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.0010 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n\n4.  **Hydrolysis of Acetate:**\n    *   The acetate ion is a weak base and will react with water (hydrolyze) to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic.\n        CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for this reaction.\n        Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n5.  **Calculating [OH⁻]:**\n    *   We can set up an equilibrium expression:\n        Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let 'x' be the concentration of [OH⁻] at equilibrium. Then [CH₃COOH] will also be 'x'.\n        5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can assume 'x' is negligible compared to 0.02, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n        5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n        x² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n        x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n6.  **Calculating pOH and pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517 ≈ **8.52**\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<D>>>"
