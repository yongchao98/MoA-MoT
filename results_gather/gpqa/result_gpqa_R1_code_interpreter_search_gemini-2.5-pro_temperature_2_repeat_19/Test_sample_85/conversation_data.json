    "This problem requires a careful analysis of reaction selectivity and the change in Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities during a two-step synthesis to determine the stereochemistry of the starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Materials and Products**\n\n*   **Product:** The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and its enantiomer (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester) with a chiral center at position C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n*   **Lactone Formation:** Lactones are formed from the intramolecular cyclization of hydroxy-carboxylic acids. In this case, the product is a 6-membered lactone, which means it is formed from a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The structure of the precursor acid is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   `HO-(CH2)2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of a compound named `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This name represents a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid where one carboxylic acid group is free, and the other is an isobutyl ester. The structure is:\n    *   `isobutyl-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n    This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. The chiral center is at C3.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nWe need to understand the selectivity of the two reducing agents:\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium Borohydride):** A moderately strong reducing agent. It reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters. It does *not* readily reduce carboxylic acids, especially when they are deprotonated to their carboxylate form (R-COO⁻). In a reaction involving a molecule with both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH4 will selectively reduce the **ester** group to a primary alcohol.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** Borane is a strong reducing agent that has a high affinity for carboxylic acids, reducing them to primary alcohols. It is less reactive towards esters. Therefore, in a molecule with both functional groups, BH3 will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group.\n\n### **3. Trace the Path of Each Reaction**\n\nLet's denote the starting acid-ester as `SM`. Let `C*` be the chiral center.\n\n#### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** LiBH4 selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group.\n    `isobutyl-OOC-CH2-C*H(Et)-CH2-COOH` (SM) → `HOCH2-CH2-C*H(Et)-CH2-COOH` (Hydroxy-acid) + isobutanol.\n2.  **Lactonization:** The resulting 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid cyclizes under acidic workup (H⁺) to form the lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** We need to track the stereochemical descriptor ((R) or (S)) through the two steps.\n    *   **Step A (Reduction):** Let's compare the groups attached to the chiral center `C*` before and after reduction.\n        *   Before: `G1 = -CH2COOiBu`, `G2 = -CH2COOH`, `G3 = -Et`, `G4 = -H`. The CIP priority is `G1 > G2 > G3`.\n        *   After: The group `G1` becomes `G1' = -CH2CH2OH`. The new groups are `G1'`, `G2`, `G3`. The new CIP priority is `G2 > G1' > G3`.\n        *   Because the priorities of the top two groups swap (`G1>G2` becomes `G2>G1'`), the configuration descriptor flips. For example, an (R)-starting material gives an (S)-hydroxy-acid. `R → S`.\n    *   **Step B (Lactonization):** The (S)-hydroxy-acid now cyclizes. Let's compare the groups before and after.\n        *   Before: `G_HA1 = -CH2COOH` (was G2), `G_HA2 = -CH2CH2OH` (was G1'). Priority `G_HA1 > G_HA2`.\n        *   After: The lactone is formed. The chiral center `C*` is now attached to `G_L1 = -CH2-O-` (from G_HA2) and `G_L2 = -CH2-C=O` (from G_HA1). The new priority is `G_L1 > G_L2`.\n        *   Again, the priorities of the top two groups have swapped. This causes another flip in the stereochemical descriptor. The (S)-hydroxy-acid gives an (R)-lactone. `S → R`.\n    *   **Overall:** There are two descriptor flips (R → S → R). This means the starting material `A` must have the **same** descriptor as the final lactone product.\n    *   Since the product is **(R)-lactone**, starting material **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n#### **Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group.\n    `isobutyl-OOC-CH2-C*H(Et)-CH2-COOH` (SM) → `isobutyl-OOC-CH2-C*H(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (Hydroxy-ester).\n2.  **Lactonization:** The resulting hydroxy-ester cyclizes via intramolecular transesterification under acidic workup (H⁺) to form the lactone and release isobutanol.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **Step A (Reduction):**\n        *   Before: `G1 = -CH2COOiBu`, `G2 = -CH2COOH`, `G3 = -Et`. Priority `G1 > G2 > G3`.\n        *   After: The group `G2` becomes `G2' = -CH2CH2OH`. The new groups are `G1`, `G2'`, `G3`. The CIP priority remains `G1 > G2' > G3`.\n        *   Since there is no change in the priority order of the groups, the descriptor does not flip. An (R)-starting material gives an (R)-hydroxy-ester. `R → R`.\n    *   **Step B (Lactonization):** The (R)-hydroxy-ester now cyclizes.\n        *   Before: `G_HE1 = -CH2COOiBu` (was G1), `G_HE2 = -CH2CH2OH` (was G2'). Priority `G_HE1 > G_HE2`.\n        *   After: The lactone is formed. The groups at the chiral center are `G_L1 = -CH2-O-` (from G_HE2) and `G_L2 = -CH2-C=O` (from G_HE1). The priority is `G_L1 > G_L2`.\n        *   The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. This causes one flip in the stereochemical descriptor. The (R)-hydroxy-ester gives an (S)-lactone. `R → S`.\n    *   **Overall:** There is one descriptor flip (R → R → S). This means the starting material `B` must have the **opposite** descriptor to the final lactone product.\n    *   The problem asks for `(R)-B → (S)-lactone`.\n    *   Since the product is **(S)-lactone**, starting material **B must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   For Reaction 1, starting material A must be the **(R)** enantiomer.\n*   For Reaction 2, starting material B must be the **(R)** enantiomer.\n\nTherefore, both A and B are the same compound: (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
