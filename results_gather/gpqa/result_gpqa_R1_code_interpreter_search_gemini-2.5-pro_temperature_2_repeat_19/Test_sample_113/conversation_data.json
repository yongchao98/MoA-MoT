    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction starts with a ketone (butan-2-one) and adds a cyanide group (-CN) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) across the carbonyl double bond. This is a classic **cyanohydrin formation** reaction.\n    2.  **Recall the mechanism:** Cyanohydrin formation involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) on the carbonyl carbon of the ketone.\n        *   Step 1: The cyanide ion, provided by NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate:\n            `CH₃CH₂C(=O)CH₃ + CN⁻  →  CH₃CH₂C(O⁻)(CN)CH₃`\n        *   Step 2: The negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final stable hydroxyl group. This requires a source of protons (H⁺).\n            `CH₃CH₂C(O⁻)(CN)CH₃ + H⁺  →  CH₃CH₂C(OH)(CN)CH₃` (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n    3.  **Determine reagent 'A':** Reagent 'A' must be the proton source.\n        *   Looking at the options for 'A':\n            *   **H₃O⁺** (hydronium ion) represents a strong acid in an aqueous solution (like HCl or H₂SO₄ dissolved in water). This is a standard reagent used in a workup step to protonate alkoxides.\n            *   **NaHSO₃** (sodium bisulfite) is used in a different type of addition reaction with aldehydes and some ketones to form bisulfite adducts, which are useful for purification. It is not the correct reagent here.\n        *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**. This is typically added after the initial reaction with NaCN.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction converts a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) while leaving the rest of the molecule (an α-hydroxy group) intact. This is the **hydrolysis of a nitrile**.\n    2.  **Recall the conditions:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is typically carried out under either strong acidic or strong basic conditions, usually with heating. The presence of H₂O in the reaction confirms it's a hydrolysis reaction.\n    3.  **Determine reagent 'B':** Reagent 'B' acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n        *   Looking at the options for 'B':\n            *   **HCl** (hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is a standard method to convert nitriles to carboxylic acids. The overall reaction is:\n                `R-CN + 2H₂O + H⁺ (catalyst)  →  R-COOH + NH₄⁺`\n            *   **CH₃COOH** (acetic acid) is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the hydrolysis of a nitrile, which requires harsh conditions.\n        *   Therefore, **B = HCl** is the most suitable reagent.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   Matching this with the given options, we find that option A is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
