    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 5: The nature of substance B.**\n    The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.\n    277 K = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    The melting point of water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    This is a very strong indication that substance **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clues 1, 3, and 4: The reaction.**\n    *   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope. Since B is D₂O, the heavier isotope is likely Deuterium (D or ²H).\n    *   Substance X reacts with liquid Y to form a precipitate G, which upon heating releases B (D₂O). This means G is likely a deuterated hydrate or a deuteroxide that decomposes upon heating. For example, a metal deuteroxide `M(OD)n` would decompose upon heating to form a metal oxide `MxOy` and D₂O (B).\n    *   The reaction also releases a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine potential simple gases involving deuterium:\n        *   HD (Hydrogen Deuteride): 2 protons (1 from H, 1 from D), 1 neutron (0 from H, 1 from D). Protons ≠ Neutrons.\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas)**: 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1). **Protons = Neutrons**. This is a perfect match. So, **W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Synthesize Clues to Identify X and the Reaction.**\n    The reaction is: X + Y → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate).\n    And G(s) --(heat)--> Substance + D₂O(g).\n    For D₂ gas to be a product, X must be a deuteride, and it must react with a source of deuterium, which would be liquid Y. The most logical candidate for **liquid Y is D₂O**.\n    The precipitate G must be a metal deuteroxide. A common metal hydroxide that precipitates is Aluminum Hydroxide, Al(OH)₃. Its deuterated analog would be **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n    The heating of aluminum hydroxide follows the reaction: 2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O.\n    Thus, heating our G would be: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This reaction releases D₂O (Substance B), confirming our hypothesis.\n    So, the reaction involves Aluminum (Al) and Deuterium (D). This strongly suggests that Substance X is a deuteride of aluminum.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clues 8 and 9: The nature of Substance X.**\n    *   Clue 9: X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points towards common laboratory reagents.\n    *   Clue 8: The reaction of X with a keto acid (R-C(=O)-COOH) gives a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains two functional groups: a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH), totaling 3 oxygen atoms (in the simplest cases). Reducing both groups leads to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains 2 oxygen atoms. A reagent powerful enough to reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids is **Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄)**.\n    *   The \"very close analog\" containing deuterium would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Identity of X as LiAlD₄.**\n    Let's check if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues:\n    *   **Substance X is LiAlD₄.** Contains the heavy isotope D. (✓)\n    *   **Its close analog is LiAlH₄,** a very common organic reagent. (✓)\n    *   It reduces a keto acid to a diol, a product with **2 oxygen atoms**. (✓)\n    *   The reaction with Y = D₂O is: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n    *   This reaction is famously **violent**. (✓)\n    *   It releases **gas W = D₂**, which has an equal number of protons and neutrons. (✓)\n    *   It forms a **precipitate G = Al(OD)₃**. (✓)\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) releases **B = D₂O**, whose melting point is ~277 K. (✓)\n    All conditions are met. Therefore, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation.**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄). The integer format of the answer choices suggests we should use integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D or ²H).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (Al, present as the isotope ²⁷Al).\n    *   The problem specifies summing the masses of all instances of these elements in the molecule.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element's atoms = 1 × (Mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element's atoms = 4 × (Mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative sum = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
