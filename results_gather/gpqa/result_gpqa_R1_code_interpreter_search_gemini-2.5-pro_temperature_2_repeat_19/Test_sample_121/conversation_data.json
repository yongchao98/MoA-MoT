    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction Sequence Analysis**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heat → Product 1**\n    *   This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reagents facilitate the alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid.\n    *   Acetic acid (CH3COOH) has one alpha-carbon (the methyl group). One of the alpha-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).**\n\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol (CH3CH2OH), H2SO4, heat → Product 2**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid group of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n    *   BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH → BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + H2O\n    *   **Product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate.**\n\n3.  **Product 2 + sodium cyanide (NaCN) → Product 3**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a strong nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group.\n    *   BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NCCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaBr\n    *   **Product 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate.** The alpha-protons (the CH2 group between the cyano and ester groups) are acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess sodium hydride (NaH) + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4**\n    *   This is a multi-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation.\n    *   **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of the acidic alpha-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    *   **First Alkylation:** The enolate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br), displacing a bromide ion. This forms an intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n    *   **Second Deprotonation:** The intermediate still has one acidic alpha-proton. Since excess NaH is used, this proton is also removed, forming a new carbanion: [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻.\n    *   **Intramolecular Cyclization:** This carbanion will undergo a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction. The nucleophilic carbon attacks the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This type of reaction, forming a stable 6-membered ring, is highly favored over intermolecular reactions.\n    *   The resulting product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group attached to the same carbon.\n    *   **Product 4 is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.**\n\n**Step 2: 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CN\n         /\n      C1 --(cyclohexane ring)\n     /  \\\n    O=C-O-CH2-CH3\n    ```\n*   **Chirality:** The C1 carbon is attached to four different groups: (1) -CN, (2) -COOCH2CH3, (3) the -C2H2- part of the ring, and (4) the -C6H2- part of the ring. Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter, and the molecule is chiral.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** Chiral molecules lack a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. This lack of symmetry means that protons that are not interchangeable by conformational changes or rotation will be chemically non-equivalent.\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This averages the axial and equatorial environments for any given proton.\n\nLet's count the signals, assuming rapid chair flipping:\n\n1.  **Ring Protons:**\n    *   Because the molecule is chiral with the stereocenter at C1, the environments on the \"left\" and \"right\" sides of the ring are different.\n    *   Therefore, C2 is not equivalent to C6. Similarly, C3 is not equivalent to C5. C4 is unique by its position.\n    *   So, the five methylene groups of the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are all in chemically distinct environments.\n    *   Under the common \"textbook\" simplification for rapidly flipping rings, the two geminal protons on each of these CH2 groups are considered averaged into one signal.\n    *   This gives five distinct signals from the ring protons: a signal for the C2-protons, C3-protons, C4-protons, C5-protons, and C6-protons.\n    *   **Total ring signals = 5**\n\n2.  **Ethoxy Group Protons (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   This ethyl group is attached to the chiral center C1 (via the carbonyl group).\n    *   **Methylene protons (-O-CH2-):** The two protons on the methylene group are adjacent to a stereocenter. This makes them diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will produce two separate signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Methyl protons (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation around the C-C bond. They will produce one signal.\n    *   **Total ethoxy signals = 2 (from CH2) + 1 (from CH3) = 3**\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Combining the signals from the ring and the ethoxy group:\n    *   Total Signals = 5 (ring) + 3 (ethoxy) = **8**\n\nThus, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
