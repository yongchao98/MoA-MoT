    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the kinematics of particle decay.** The core principles are the conservation of energy and momentum. The type of energy spectrum (continuous vs. discrete) of an outgoing particle depends on the number of particles in the final state.\n    *   If a decay results in only **two** final particles, conservation of energy and momentum completely constrains the energies of the outgoing particles. This leads to a **discrete** energy spectrum (a sharp peak).\n    *   If a decay results in **three or more** final particles, the available energy and momentum can be distributed among them in a continuous range of ways. This results in a **continuous** energy spectrum for any of the individual particles (or sum of a subset of particles).\n\n2.  **Analyze the original decay:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`\n    *   **Final State:** There are six particles in the final state. The problem states A and B are \"heavy nucleons\", while E and V are \"much lighter\". This means the two heavy B nucleons will have very little recoil kinetic energy. The vast majority of the released energy (the Q-value) will be shared among the four light particles: two E particles and two V particles.\n    *   **Spectrum Type:** Since the kinetic energy is shared among four light particles, this is a multi-body final state. Therefore, the energy of the E particles (individually or their sum) is not fixed. It can vary from nearly zero up to a maximum value. This results in a **continuous** spectrum, which matches the information given in the problem.\n\n3.  **Analyze the variant decay:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + 1M`\n    *   **Final State:** In this case, there are five particles in the final state. The released kinetic energy is shared among the three light particles: two E particles and the one M particle.\n    *   **Spectrum Type:** Since the energy is shared among three light particles, this is also a multi-body final state. Therefore, the total energy spectrum of the two E particles will also be **continuous**. It will have a different shape from the original decay because the phase space calculation for a 3-body decay is different from a 4-body decay, but it remains continuous.\n    *   **Conclusion on Spectrum Shape:** The spectrum remains continuous. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n4.  **Compare the endpoints of the spectra.** The endpoint of the energy spectrum represents the maximum possible energy for the E particles. This maximum energy is equal to the total kinetic energy released in the decay, known as the Q-value. The Q-value is determined by the difference between the total rest mass of the initial particles and the total rest mass of the final particles, according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (`E=mc²`).\n    *   Let `m_X` be the mass of particle X.\n    *   **Q-value for the original decay (Q₁):**\n        `Q₁ = (Total Initial Rest Energy) - (Total Final Rest Energy)`\n        `Q₁ = (2 * m_A * c²) - (2 * m_B * c² + 2 * m_E * c² + 2 * m_V * c²)`\n    *   **Q-value for the variant decay (Q₂):**\n        `Q₂ = (Total Initial Rest Energy) - (Total Final Rest Energy)`\n        `Q₂ = (2 * m_A * c²) - (2 * m_B * c² + 2 * m_E * c² + m_M * c²)`\n\n5.  **Use the given properties of the particles to compare Q₁ and Q₂.**\n    *   The problem states that particle M is **massless**, so `m_M = 0`.\n    *   The problem describes particle V as a \"light particle\". It does not state that V is massless. In particle physics, any particle has a non-negative mass (`m ≥ 0`). Unless explicitly stated to be massless (like a photon or the hypothetical M), a particle is assumed to have mass (`m > 0`). The real-world analogue for V, a neutrino, has a small but definitively non-zero mass. Therefore, we assume `m_V > 0`.\n    *   Now, let's substitute `m_M = 0` into the equation for Q₂:\n        `Q₂ = 2m_A c² - 2m_B c² - 2m_E c²`\n    *   Let's rewrite Q₁:\n        `Q₁ = (2m_A c² - 2m_B c² - 2m_E c²) - 2m_V c²`\n    *   By comparing the two expressions, we can see:\n        `Q₂ = Q₁ + 2m_V c²`\n    *   Since `m_V > 0`, the term `2m_V c²` is positive.\n    *   Therefore, `Q₂ > Q₁`.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** The endpoint of the energy spectrum in the variant decay (`Q₂`) is greater than the endpoint in the original decay (`Q₁`).\n    *   The spectrum **remains continuous**.\n    *   The endpoint **increases**.\n    *   This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
