    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its general formula.\n    *   The mass percentage of hydrogen is calculated as `(mass of H) / (total mass) * 100%`. The atomic mass of Carbon (C) is ~12 g/mol and Hydrogen (H) is ~1 g/mol.\n    *   14.28% is numerically very close to the fraction 1/7 (since 1/7 â‰ˆ 0.142857).\n    *   Let's test the general formula for alkanes, CnH(2n+2). Mass % H = `(2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7(2n+2) = 14n+2`, which simplifies to `14n+14 = 14n+2`, an impossibility.\n    *   Let's test the general formula for cycloalkanes or alkenes, CnH2n. Mass % H = `(2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`. This matches perfectly.\n    *   The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon that does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is saturated. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a **cycloalkane**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's say C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means `Hydrogenation(C + D) -> Z`.\n    *   Since C is Z (a saturated cycloalkane), it does not hydrogenate. Therefore, the other component, D, must hydrogenate to Z: `Hydrogenation(D) -> Z`.\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water but reacts with hydrogen under \"rather severe conditions\" to give a cycloalkane Z, D must be an **aromatic hydrocarbon** with the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The simplest and most common chemical system that fits this description is the **benzene/cyclohexane pair**. This corresponds to a 6-carbon atom skeleton (n=6).\n    *   So, Z = **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and D = **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Let's verify these fit the description:\n        *   Z (cyclohexane) is a widely used solvent. Correct.\n        *   Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}. This is a mixture of two liquids. Both do not decolorize bromine water. Correct.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   A and B decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds\" is a condition on their structure.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means `Hydrogenation(A) -> Cyclohexane` and `Hydrogenation(B) -> Cyclohexane`. This confirms A and B are unsaturated hydrocarbons with a 6-carbon cyclic skeleton. They are isomers of cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene.\n    *   The reaction `X -> Y` is a disproportionation that happens on a platinum catalyst. An equimolar mixture of X {A, B} gives an equimolar mixture of Y {cyclohexane, benzene}.\n    *   This implies a 1:1 reaction stoichiometry: `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   This type of reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One molecule is the hydrogen donor (it gets dehydrogenated/oxidized to benzene), and the other is the hydrogen acceptor (it gets hydrogenated/reduced to cyclohexane).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms.**\n    *   The chemical reaction involves the atoms of the reactants A and B rearranging to form the products, cyclohexane and benzene. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of A and one molecule of B) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of cyclohexane and one molecule of benzene).\n    *   Number of H atoms in cyclohexane (C6H12) = 12.\n    *   Number of H atoms in benzene (C6H6) = 6.\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   This sum represents the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n5.  **Final Check.**\n    *   The total number of hydrogens is 18. The components of X must be unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons whose hydrogens sum to 18. The most plausible candidates are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   `10 + 8 = 18`. This is consistent.\n    *   A cyclohexadiene isomer that is not conjugated is **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so it cannot be conjugated. The condition \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" is satisfied.\n    *   The reaction `C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) -> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)` is a known hydrogen transfer reaction. The diene gives up 2 hydrogens to the ene. Everything is consistent.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which we calculated to be 18.\n\nFinal Answer based on the options:\nA) 22\nB) 16\nC) 18\nD) 12\n\nThe calculated value is 18, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
