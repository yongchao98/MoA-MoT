    "To solve this problem, we need to find the total mass of each binary star system and then calculate the ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2.\n\n### Key Concepts and Formula\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars (K1 and K2) by the following formula:\n\nM_total = (m1 + m2) = [P / (2πG * sin³(i))] * (K1 + K2)³\n\nwhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the orbital inclination (the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\nThe problem states that both systems \"exhibit eclipses\". This is a critical piece of information. For eclipses to occur, the orbital plane must be very close to our line of sight, meaning the inclination angle `i` must be close to 90°. When `i` ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. We can thus assume sin³(i) = 1 for both systems.\n\nWith this assumption, the formula simplifies to:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\nThe constant of proportionality is 1 / (2πG), which will be the same for both systems.\n\n### Applying the Formula to Each System\n\nWe can now calculate a value proportional to the mass for each system. We must use consistent units for Period (years) and Velocity (km/s) since we are taking a ratio.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star 1 (K1a) = 10 km/s\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star 2 (K1b) = 5 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K1a + K1b) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\nM1_total ∝ P1 * (K1a + K1b)³\nM1_total ∝ 2 * (15)³\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star 1 (K2a) = 15 km/s\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star 2 (K2b) = 10 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K2a + K2b) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nM2_total ∝ P2 * (K2a + K2b)³\nM2_total ∝ 1 * (25)³\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This is the ratio M1_total / M2_total.\n\nRatio = (M1_total) / (M2_total) = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nRatio = 2 * (15/25)³\n\nSimplify the fraction 15/25:\n15/25 = 3/5\n\nNow substitute this back into the ratio equation:\nRatio = 2 * (3/5)³\nRatio = 2 * (3³ / 5³)\nRatio = 2 * (27 / 125)\nRatio = 54 / 125\n\nTo find the decimal value:\nRatio = 0.432\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass of system_1 is approximately 0.432 times the mass of system_2. Looking at the given options:\nA) ~ 0.4\nB) ~ 0.7\nC) ~ 1.2\nD) ~ 0.6\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
