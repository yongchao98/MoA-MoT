    "This is a problem that combines concepts of stereochemistry in organic reactions with analytical separation techniques. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is achiral because it possesses a C2 rotational symmetry axis.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. mCPBA; 2. H3O+ (aqueous acid).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This two-step process results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene.\n    *   **Step 1.1 (Epoxidation):** The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA is a stereospecific **syn-addition** of an oxygen atom across the double bond to form an epoxide. Since the starting (E)-alkene is trans, the two propyl groups (CH3CH2CH2-) will be trans to each other in the resulting epoxide. This trans arrangement leads to a chiral product. Because the starting material and mCPBA are achiral, the epoxidation will produce a **racemic mixture** of the two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   **Step 1.2 (Acid-catalyzed Ring Opening):** The epoxide is then treated with aqueous acid (H3O+). This is a ring-opening reaction where water (H2O) acts as a nucleophile. The attack occurs from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen, resulting in an **anti-addition** of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups overall (one from the epoxide oxygen, one from the water molecule). The configuration at the carbon that is attacked is inverted.\n        *   Starting with the (4R,5R)-epoxide enantiomer, attack at C4 inverts its configuration to S, giving (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 inverts its configuration to S, giving (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Starting with the (4S,5S)-epoxide enantiomer, attack at C4 inverts its configuration to R, giving (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 inverts its configuration to R, giving (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** Notice that all paths lead to the same product(s): (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. These are actually the same molecule, which is a **meso compound**. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by acid yields a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. mCPBA; 2. H3O+ (aqueous acid).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n    *   **Step 2.1 (Epoxidation):** Syn-addition of oxygen to the cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide, where the two propyl groups are on the same side of the epoxide ring. This product, (cis)-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is a **meso compound**. So, this step produces only one product.\n    *   **Step 2.2 (Acid-catalyzed Ring Opening):** The meso-epoxide undergoes anti-attack by water.\n        *   Let's denote the meso-epoxide as (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Backside attack at C4 (which is R) inverts the center to S. The configuration at C5 is unchanged. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Backside attack at C5 (which is S) inverts the center to R. The configuration at C4 is unchanged. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are **enantiomers**. Since attack at either carbon of the symmetrical meso-epoxide is equally probable, they are formed in a 1:1 ratio, resulting in a **racemic mixture**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by acid yields a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nRelationship between the isomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n*   Achiral HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their bulk physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, however, have different physical properties. The meso-diol will have a different polarity and shape compared to the enantiomeric pair, so it will have a different retention time.\n*   Thus, the standard HPLC will show **two peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each of the three stereoisomers in the mixture.\n*   The meso-diol (a diastereomer to the others) will have its own unique retention time.\n*   The enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will have different affinities for the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   Assuming maximum possible resolution, the chiral HPLC will show **three peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
