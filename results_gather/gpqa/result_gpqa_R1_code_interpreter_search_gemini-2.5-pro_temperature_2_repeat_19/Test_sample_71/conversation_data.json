    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene: This is a norbornadiene derivative that will act as the dienophile. It has two double bonds available for reaction.\n    *   5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene: This compound serves as a precursor to a reactive diene.\n    *   Sodium Iodide (NaI): This reagent is used to generate the reactive diene *in situ*.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of a 1,2-bis(dihalomethyl)alkane with sodium iodide is a standard method for generating a reactive diene (an o-quinodimethane-type species). In this case, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene reacts with NaI to eliminate the four bromine atoms and form two new exocyclic double bonds.\n*   **Diene Generated:** The product of this elimination is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**. Let's call this molecule **DMCHD**.\n*   **Diels-Alder Reaction:** DMCHD is a highly reactive diene. It will react with the dienophile, 7-(tert-butoxy)norbornadiene. The problem states that 2 equivalents of the diene precursor are used, indicating that both double bonds of the norbornadiene will react in two separate Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   **Product 1:** A complex, C2-symmetric molecule is formed where two DMCHD molecules have added across the two double bonds of the norbornadiene skeleton. The additions will occur from the face *anti* to the bulky tert-butoxy group at C7.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O)\n*   **Reaction:** Aqueous acid is used for the cleavage of tert-butyl ethers. The tert-butoxy group at the C7 position is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product 2:** The structure is identical to Product 1, but the -O-tBu group at C7 has been replaced by an -OH group. The C2 symmetry of the molecule is maintained.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2\n*   **Reagent:** SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation)\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for the mild oxidation of primary or secondary alcohols. The secondary alcohol at C7 in Product 2 is oxidized to a ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** The structure is identical to Product 2, but the C7-OH group has been oxidized to a ketone (C7=O). The molecule is a derivative of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-7-one and still possesses C2 symmetry. A detailed analysis shows this symmetric molecule has 10 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3\n*   **Conditions:** Heating at 150°C\n*   **Reaction:** The problem states that heating product 3 gives product 4, implying a chemical transformation. Complex molecules formed by Diels-Alder reactions often undergo a retro-Diels-Alder reaction upon heating.\n    1.  **Retro-Diels-Alder:** Product 3 undergoes two sequential retro-Diels-Alder reactions, breaking it down into its constituent parts. This process releases the two molecules of the diene (DMCHD) that were added in Step 1. The central core fragment is **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.\n    2.  **Decarbonylation:** Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one is thermally unstable. At temperatures around 150°C, it readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination (a type of pericyclic reaction) to release carbon monoxide (CO) and form **benzene** (C₆H₆).\n*   **Final Products:** The thermal decomposition of Product 3 yields three substances: benzene, carbon monoxide, and two molecules of 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (DMCHD).\n*   **Identifying Product 4:** The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in \"final product 4.\"\n    *   If Product 4 were benzene, it would have 1 signal, which is not among the options.\n    *   Thus, \"Product 4\" must refer to the other major organic product, **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (DMCHD)**. While this diene is reactive and would likely dimerize if left alone, the question most plausibly asks for the properties of the direct product of the fragmentation.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene)**\n\n*   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4, and exocyclic double bonds (=CH₂) at C5 and C6. Its chemical formula is C₈H₈.\n*   **Symmetry:** On the NMR timescale, the molecule has C₂v symmetry. It has a C₂ rotational axis and two perpendicular mirror planes.\n*   **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** We can use the symmetry to determine which hydrogens are chemically equivalent.\n    *   There are 4 hydrogens on the cyclohexa-1,3-diene ring. The two at C1 and C4 are equivalent to each other (Set 1). The two at C2 and C3 are equivalent to each other (Set 2).\n    *   There are 4 hydrogens on the two exocyclic methylidene (=CH₂) groups. The two =CH₂ groups are equivalent by symmetry. However, within each group, the two hydrogens are not equivalent; they are diastereotopic. One hydrogen points towards the ring's interior, and one points outwards. The two \"inner\" hydrogens are equivalent to each other (Set 3), and the two \"outer\" hydrogens are equivalent to each other (Set 4).\n*   **Conclusion:** There are four sets of chemically equivalent protons:\n    1.  {H1, H4}\n    2.  {H2, H3}\n    3.  {H at C5 & C6, \"inner\"}\n    4.  {H at C5 & C6, \"outer\"}\n\nTherefore, there are **4** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
