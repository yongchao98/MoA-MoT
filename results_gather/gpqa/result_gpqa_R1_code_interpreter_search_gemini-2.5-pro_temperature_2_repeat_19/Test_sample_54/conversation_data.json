    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the total number of protons.**\n\nThe 1H NMR data provides the integration (relative number of protons) for each signal:\n*   7.0 ppm: 1H\n*   5.5 ppm: 1H\n*   2.1 ppm: 3H\n*   1.6 ppm: 3H\n\nThe total number of protons giving rise to these signals is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = **8 protons**.\n\n### **Step 2: Compare the total proton count with the possible structures.**\n\nLet's determine the number of protons in each of the potential compounds.\n*   **Propenyl acetate:** The formula is C5H8O2. The most likely structure is `CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH3`. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **8H**. This matches the NMR data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate:** The formula is C6H10O2. The most likely structure is `CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH2-CH3`. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = **10H**. This does not match the NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion from Step 2:** The total integration (8H) matches propenyl acetate but not butenyl acetate. Therefore, we can eliminate options A (Trans-butenyl acetate) and B (Cis-butenyl acetate). The unknown compound must be either Trans-propenyl acetate or Cis-propenyl acetate.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans) using the coupling constant (J).**\n\nThe choice between the cis and trans isomers depends on the coupling constant between the two protons on the double bond (the vinylic protons).\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is described as a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**. This splitting is due to its interaction with the other vinylic proton (at 5.5 ppm).\n*   In 1H NMR spectroscopy, the magnitude of the vicinal coupling constant (³J_HH) across a double bond is stereochemically dependent:\n    *   **J_trans** (protons are on opposite sides of the double bond) is typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **J_cis** (protons are on the same side of the double bond) is typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n*   The observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls directly within the expected range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion from Step 3:** The large coupling constant indicates a trans double bond. Therefore, the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate. This eliminates option D (Cis-propenyl acetate).\n\n### **Step 4: Confirm the full assignment for Trans-propenyl acetate.**\n\nLet's assign all the signals to the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate: `CH3(a)-COO-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH3(d)`\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal corresponds to the acetate methyl protons, H(a). It is a singlet (s) because it has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal corresponds to the vinylic proton H(b), which is attached to the oxygen atom, causing it to be significantly deshielded (shifted downfield). It is split into a doublet (d) by the other vinylic proton, H(c), with a large trans-coupling constant.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal corresponds to the vinylic proton H(c). It is split by H(b) (giving a doublet, J ≈ 16 Hz) and also by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group H(d) (giving a quartet). The resulting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal corresponds to the methyl protons H(d) attached to the double bond. They are split by the single adjacent vinylic proton H(c), resulting in a doublet (d).\n\nAll aspects of the provided 1H NMR data are consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
