    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Process:**\n    The problem describes a particle annihilation event: a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) collide and are destroyed, creating four new particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$).\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Principles:**\n    In any particle interaction, fundamental quantities are conserved. The most relevant ones here are:\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the reaction must equal the total energy after the reaction.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the reaction must equal the total momentum after the reaction.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation):**\n    *   **Particles:** One proton ($p$) and one antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   **Energy:**\n        *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common simplification in physics problems, meaning its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. So, we can consider it to be at rest for energy calculations.\n        *   The proton is assumed to be the stationary target, so it is also at rest.\n        *   The energy of a particle at rest is given by Einstein's famous equation, $E = mc^2$.\n        *   Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n        *   $E_{initial} = E_p + E_{\\bar{p}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$.\n        *   A proton and an antiproton have the same mass ($m_p = m_{\\bar{p}}$). I need the value for the proton's rest mass energy. The standard accepted value is approximately $938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n        *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   **Momentum:**\n        *   Since both the proton and the \"slowly moving\" antiproton are considered to be at rest, their individual momenta are zero.\n        *   The total initial momentum is $P_{initial} = 0$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation):**\n    *   **Particles:** Four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are likely a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. The problem gives us $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   **Momentum:**\n        *   Due to the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum ($P_{final}$) must also be zero. $P_{final} = P_{initial} = 0$.\n        *   For the total momentum of the four final particles to be zero, their vector momenta must cancel out. The most symmetric and simplest outcome is that all four particles are emitted with the same speed, $v_A$.\n    *   **Energy:**\n        *   Since the final particles are moving, their energy is the total relativistic energy, given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$.\n        *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles.\n        *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n        *   Substituting the known value for $m_A c^2$: $E_{final} = 4 \\gamma (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n5.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   Set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n        $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n        $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Now, I can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Velocity:**\n    *   The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is related to the velocity $v$ (or more conveniently, $\\beta = v/c$) by the equation $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}$. I need to rearrange this to solve for $\\beta$.\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1-\\beta^2}$\n        $1-\\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Now, I will substitute the value of $\\gamma$ I found. To get a precise answer, I will use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.27\n\n# Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300\n\n# Total initial energy (proton + antiproton at rest)\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# Total final energy is 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# E_initial = E_final\n# 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# Solve for gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Now solve for beta (v/c) from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / (gamma**2))\n\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\n>>>\nThe velocity of particle A is 0.77c\n<<<\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is an annihilation process where a proton and an antiproton, initially at rest (or \"slowly moving\"), convert their entire mass into the mass and kinetic energy of four new particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$). To solve this, we will use the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n**1. Initial State Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\n\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume both the proton and the antiproton are effectively at rest.\n*   The total energy before the annihilation is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton ($p$) and the antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   A proton and an antiproton have the same rest mass. The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   Therefore, the total initial energy is:\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**2. Final State Energy ($E_{final}$)**\n\n*   After the annihilation, four particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$) are created. All these particles will have the same mass, $m_A$, given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   By conservation of momentum (since the initial momentum was zero), the four particles must move away from the collision point in such a way that their total vector momentum is zero. Due to symmetry, we can assume they all have the same speed, $v$, and thus the same kinetic energy.\n*   The total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy equation:\n    $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   Since there are four such particles, the total final energy is:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\, \\text{MeV}) = 1200 \\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**3. Applying Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   According to the principle of conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n    $1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$\n*   Now we can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.564$\n\n**4. Calculating the Velocity**\n\n*   We now use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity $v$. It's often easier to solve for $\\beta = v/c$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n*   Rearranging the equation to solve for $\\beta$:\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Substituting the value of $\\gamma$ we found:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.564)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.446}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.409} \\approx \\sqrt{0.591} \\approx 0.769$\n*   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = 0.769c$, which is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nThis calculation was confirmed by the executed Python code, which yielded a result of $0.77c$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
