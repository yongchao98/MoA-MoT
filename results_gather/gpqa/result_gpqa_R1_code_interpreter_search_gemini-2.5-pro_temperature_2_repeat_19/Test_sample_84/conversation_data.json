    "**1. Identify the Goal:**\nThe main objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2 ($T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$).\n\n**2. Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}\\right)^{1/2} \\cdot (1-A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:**\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\cdot (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1})^{1/2} \\cdot (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\cdot (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2})^{1/2} \\cdot (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same and cancel out. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), so the $(1-A)^{1/4}$ term also cancels. The expression simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(\\frac{1}{a_1})^{1/2}}{(\\frac{1}{a_2})^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2}$\n\nThis means the ratio of the temperatures depends only on the ratio of their orbital semi-major axes. Our next step is to find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$.\n\n**4. Relate Radial Velocity (RV) Data to Orbital Parameters:**\nThe Doppler shift information allows us to determine the star's radial velocity amplitude ($K_{star}$) caused by each planet. The formula for Doppler shift is:\n$\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} \\implies v_r = c \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\nThe maximum Doppler shift corresponds to the RV amplitude, $K_{star}$.\n$K_{star1} = c \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_0}$\n$K_{star2} = c \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_0}$\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV amplitude is given by:\n$K_{star} = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{G(M_{star} + M_p)}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet mass, $M_{star}$ is the star mass, $a$ is the semi-major axis, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\nSince the planets are detected by both transit and RV methods, we can assume the orbits are edge-on, so the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Also, the planets' masses ($7 M_{Earth}$ and $5 M_{Earth}$) are negligible compared to the star's mass ($1.5 M_{Sun}$), so $M_{star} + M_p \\approx M_{star}$.\nThe simplified formula for $K_{star}$ becomes:\n$K_{star} \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{G M_{star}}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n**5. Determine the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:**\nLet's rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\approx \\frac{M_p}{K_{star} \\sqrt{G M_{star}}}$\n$a \\approx \\left( \\frac{M_p}{K_{star}} \\right)^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{G M_{star}}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{K_{star2}} \\right)^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{G M_{star}}}{\\left( \\frac{M_{p1}}{K_{star1}} \\right)^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{G M_{star}}}$\n\nThe terms $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{K_{star2}} \\right)^2 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{K_{star1}}{M_{p1}} \\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}}\\right)^2$\n\nWe know that $K_{star}$ is proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore:\n$\\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the ratio for $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\nNow substitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into our temperature ratio formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2}$\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n**7. Plug in the Values:**\n*   $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\cdot \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{5}{7} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n**8. Compute the Numerical Value:**\nTo get the final numerical answer, we can use the following python code.\n```python\n# Masses of the planets in Earth masses\nM_p1 = 7.0\nM_p2 = 5.0\n\n# Doppler shifts induced by the planets in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\ntemp_ratio = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n> 실행 결과\n```\n0.5357142857142857\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.536, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**1. Goal Identification**\nThe primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, denoted as $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For a planet in a circular orbit, this is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nWhere:\n- $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n- $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n- $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n- $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n**3. Forming the Temperature Ratio**\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}} \\cdot (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nSeveral terms cancel out:\n- $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both planets as they orbit the same star.\n- The problem states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$).\n- The constant '2' also cancels.\n\nThe formula simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends solely on the ratio of their semi-major axes. Our next task is to determine this ratio, $a_2 / a_1$.\n\n**4. Using Radial Velocity Data**\nThe problem provides information about the periodic Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda$) caused by each planet. The maximum Doppler shift is related to the star's radial velocity amplitude ($K_{star}$) by the formula:\n$\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} \\implies K_{star} = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\nWhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe star's radial velocity amplitude ($K_{star}$) induced by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K_{star} = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}+M_p}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\nWe can make some simplifying assumptions based on the problem statement:\n- The planets are detected via both transit and RV, which implies their orbits are nearly edge-on to our line of sight. Therefore, the inclination $i \\approx 90°$, and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n- The planets' masses ($M_p$) are very small compared to the star's mass ($M_{star}$), so $M_{star} + M_p \\approx M_{star}$.\n\nThe simplified formula becomes:\n$K_{star} \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\n**5. Deriving the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nLet's rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K_{star} \\sqrt{M_{star}}}$\n$a \\approx \\left(\\frac{M_p}{K_{star}}\\right)^2 \\frac{G}{M_{star}}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{K_{star2}}\\right)^2 \\frac{G}{M_{star}}}{\\left(\\frac{M_{p1}}{K_{star1}}\\right)^2 \\frac{G}{M_{star}}}$\n\nThe terms $G$ and $M_{star}$ are constants for both planets and cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}}\\right)^2$\n\nSince $K_{star}$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda$, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nSubstituting this into our expression for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}}\\right)^2$\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\nNow, we substitute this back into our temperature ratio formula from Step 3:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}}\\right)^2}$\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n- $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n- $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n- $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\cdot \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{5}{7} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n**7.

    "The Python code successfully executed, yielding a result of approximately 0.5357. This value represents the calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 2 ($T_{eq1}/T_{eq2}$).\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n1.  The ratio of equilibrium temperatures simplifies to $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$, where $a_1$ and $a_2$ are the semi-major axes of Planet 1 and Planet 2, respectively.\n2.  From the radial velocity (Doppler shift) data, the semi-major axis `a` is related to the planet mass ($M_p$) and the induced Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) by the proportion $a \\propto (M_p / \\Delta\\lambda)^2$.\n3.  Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}})^2 \\cdot (\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2})^2$.\n4.  Substituting this into the temperature ratio equation gives $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n5.
