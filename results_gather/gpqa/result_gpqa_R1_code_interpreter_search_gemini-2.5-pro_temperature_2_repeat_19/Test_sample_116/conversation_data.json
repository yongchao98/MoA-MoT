    "**1. Analyzing Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable on the original molecule. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are:\n*   **A chiral center:** A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Axial chirality (Atropisomerism):** Chirality arising from restricted rotation about a single bond, typically seen in substituted biphenyls.\n\nLet's examine each compound based on these principles.\n\n**2. Compound-by-Compound Analysis**\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond.\n    *   **Substituents:** The positions ortho to the bond linking the rings (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted.\n        *   Positions 2 and 2' have dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃).\n        *   Positions 6 and 6' have nitro groups (-NO₂).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The substituents at the ortho positions (-COOCH₃ and -NO₂) are large and bulky. This bulkiness creates significant steric hindrance, preventing the two phenyl rings from rotating freely about the single bond that connects them. As a result, the rings are forced to be non-coplanar (twisted relative to each other). This restricted rotation creates a chiral axis along the C1-C1' bond. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, it is chiral and will have two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine Carbon-2 (the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since Carbon-2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or asymmetric carbon). A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **3. benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C₆H₅)₂CO. It consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) attached to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The carbonyl carbon is only bonded to three atoms (one oxygen via a double bond and two carbons). We must check for overall molecular symmetry. Although the two phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group due to steric hindrance, the molecule as a whole is symmetric. It possesses a C₂ rotational axis that passes through the C=O bond. The molecule is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), which makes it achiral. Additionally, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry renders a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**3. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, only compounds **1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate)** and **2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate)** are chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nThus, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
