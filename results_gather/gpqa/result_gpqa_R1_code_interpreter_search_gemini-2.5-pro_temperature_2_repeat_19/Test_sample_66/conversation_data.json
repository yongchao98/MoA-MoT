    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n*   The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n*   This state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared operator, $L^2 = (\\vec{L}_1 + \\vec{L}_2)^2$, with eigenvalue $l(l+1)\\hbar^2 = 2(2+1)\\hbar^2 = 6\\hbar^2$.\n*   This state is also an eigenstate of the z-component of the total angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar = -\\hbar$.\n\n### 2. Understanding the Measurement\n\n*   A measurement is performed on the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n*   The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_{l1}\\hbar$. For the eigenvalue to be $-\\hbar$, we must have the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n*   Similarly, the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_{l2}\\hbar$. For the eigenvalue to be $-\\hbar$, we must have $m_{l2} = -1$.\n*   Therefore, the measurement outcome corresponds to finding the system in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Probability\n\nThe probability of measuring a specific outcome is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the final state (the measurement outcome state).\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l=2, m=-1\\rangle$\n*   **Final State (Outcome):** $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = |m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$\n\nThe probability, $P$, is given by:\n$P = |\\langle \\psi_{final} | \\psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2$\n\n### 4. Applying the Conservation of Angular Momentum\n\nWe can determine this probability by considering the properties of the states under the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n\n*   The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with a total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    $L_z |l=2, m=-1\\rangle = -1\\hbar |l=2, m=-1\\rangle$\n\n*   The final state $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$. Let's find its eigenvalue:\n    $L_z |m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle = (L_{1z} + L_{2z})|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$\n    $= (m_{l1}\\hbar + m_{l2}\\hbar) |m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$\n    $= (-1\\hbar - 1\\hbar) |m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$\n    $= -2\\hbar |m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$\n    The total magnetic quantum number for this state is $m_{total} = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$.\n\nSince the initial state has a total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$ and the final state has $m_{total} = -2$, they are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) with different eigenvalues ($-\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$). A fundamental theorem of quantum mechanics states that such eigenstates must be orthogonal.\n\nTherefore, their inner product is zero:\n$\\langle m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle = 0$\n\nAnd the probability is:\n$P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe measurement of the components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ cannot change the total z-component of angular momentum of the isolated system. Since the system starts with $m=-1$, any measurement outcome of $(m_{l1}, m_{l2})$ must satisfy $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$. The requested outcome $(m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1)$ has a sum of $-2$, which violates this principle. Thus, the probability of observing this outcome is exactly zero.\n\n<<<B>>>"
