    "This problem requires us to analyze several gene mutations and determine which one is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the target anti-nutritional compound. The most effective mutations for knocking out gene function are typically those that cause the most significant disruption to the protein's structure. These are usually nonsense mutations (which introduce a premature stop codon) or frameshift mutations (which alter the entire downstream amino acid sequence).\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of each mutant compared to the intact gene:\n\n**1. Intact Gene Analysis**\n\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’\n*   We'll break this down into codons (three-letter 'words') and translate them into amino acids.\n*   `ATG`: Methionine (This is the START codon)\n*   `TTT`: Phenylalanine (Phe)\n*   `CTC`: Leucine (Leu)\n*   `GCT`: Alanine (Ala)\n*   `GGT`: Glycine (Gly)\n*   **Initial Protein Sequence:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-...\n\n**2. Mutant Analysis**\n\nWe will now analyze each mutant sequence in the same way.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT... -3’\n    *   **Translation:**\n        *   `ATG`: Methionine (Met)\n        *   `TTC`: Phenylalanine (Phe) - Same as the intact gene, since both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine. This is a *silent mutation*.\n        *   `TAC`: Tyrosine (Tyr) - This is different from the intact gene's Leucine (`CTC`). This is a *missense mutation*.\n    *   **Effect:** The protein produced will have one amino acid (Leucine) swapped for another (Tyrosine). This might alter or reduce the protein's function, but there's a good chance it will still be partially or fully functional. It's not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT... -3’\n    *   **Translation:**\n        *   `ATG`: Methionine (Met)\n        *   `TTC`: Phenylalanine (Phe)\n        *   `TAA`: **STOP** - This codon does not code for an amino acid; it signals the ribosome to stop translation.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a *nonsense mutation*. Protein synthesis will stop after only two amino acids (Met-Phe). The resulting product will be a tiny, truncated dipeptide instead of the full-length protein. It is virtually certain that this product will be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC... -3’\n    *   **Translation:** Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly-Val...\n    *   **Effect:** This sequence shows at least two *missense mutations* when compared to the intact gene (Leu -> Tyr and Thr -> Val). Similar to Mutant 1, this changes some amino acids but does not guarantee a loss of function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **Sequence:** A comparison of the provided string for Mutant 4 with the intact gene reveals a complex pattern of changes that result in multiple amino acid substitutions (multiple missense mutations), similar to Mutant 3. For example, `CTC` (Leu) becomes `TAC` (Tyr), and `GGT` (Gly) becomes `ACT` (Thr).\n    *   **Effect:** Like mutants 1 and 3, this creates a protein with altered amino acids. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTo \"most probably\" eliminate the compound, we need the mutation most likely to create a completely non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Missense Mutations (Mutants 1, 3, 4):** These are a gamble. They might work, but they might not.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation (Mutant 2):** This is the most definitive knockout. By introducing a STOP codon very early in the sequence, it ensures that the vast majority of the protein is never even synthesized. The resulting tiny peptide fragment will lack the structure and active sites of the original enzyme, guaranteeing a loss of function. Furthermore, mRNA containing premature stop codons is often targeted for degradation in the cell, a process known as nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), which would further prevent the production of any protein.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 provides the highest probability of successfully eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
