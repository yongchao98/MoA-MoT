    "This is a classic problem involving exponential decay, which is characteristic of radioactive decay. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understand the Nature of Radioactive Decay:** Radioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic decay probability for the next period. Therefore, we just need to calculate the probability of it decaying in any 150-minute interval.\n\n2.  **Define the Decay Probability:** The probability of a single atom *surviving* for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    `P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n    The probability of the atom *decaying* within time `t` is:\n    `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survival(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P_decay(100) = 0.32`\n    `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n\n    Solving for the survival probability part:\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32`\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n\n    This value, `e^(-λ * 100)`, represents the probability of the atom surviving for 100 minutes. We don't need to solve for `λ` itself, but rather use this relationship.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless property, this is the same as the probability of a fresh atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n    We can rewrite the exponent `-λ * 150` in terms of what we know:\n    `-λ * 150 = (-λ * 100) * (150 / 100) = (-λ * 100) * 1.5`\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the probability formula:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^((-λ * 100) * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n\n    We already found that `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`. So:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    Now we calculate this value:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 = (0.68) * sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`\n\n    This is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes. The probability of it *decaying* is:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%. This is closest to 44%.\n\nFor a more precise calculation:\n```python\n# The probability of survival for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\nprob_survival_100_min = 0.68\n\n# We want the probability of decay in 150 minutes.\n# This is 1 - P_survival(150)\n# P_survival(t) = exp(-lambda * t)\n# P_survival(150) = exp(-lambda * 150) = exp(-lambda * 100 * 1.5)\n#                 = (exp(-lambda * 100))^1.5\n#                 = (P_survival(100))^1.5\nprob_survival_150_min = prob_survival_100_min ** 1.5\n\n# The probability of decay in 150 minutes is 1 minus the survival probability.\nprob_decay_150_min = 1 - prob_survival_150_min\n\nprint(f\"{prob_decay_150_min:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>0.4393\n\nThe calculation confirms that the probability is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's the reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a stochastic process governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. A crucial feature of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a given future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already existed without decaying.\n\nThe fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior. We are simply asked to calculate the probability that the atom will decay in a 150-minute period.\n\n**2. Set up the Mathematical Framework**\n\nThe probability `P(t)` that an atom survives (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law:\nP_survival(t) = e^(-λt)\nwhere λ (lambda) is the decay constant for this specific type of atom.\n\nThe probability that the atom *decays* within a time `t` is therefore:\nP_decay(t) = 1 - P_survival(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**3. Use the Given Data to Find a Key Value**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\nP_decay(100) = 0.32\n1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n\nFrom this, we can find the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nThis value, `e^(-λ * 100)`, is a key intermediate result that we can use without explicitly solving for λ.\n\n**4. Calculate the Required Probability**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. As established, this is the same as finding the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval.\nP_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can express `e^(-λ * 150)` in terms of our known value `e^(-λ * 100)`:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\nNow, substitute the value we found in step 3:\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nLet's calculate this value. The python script you provided did this calculation:\n(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n\nThis is the probability that the atom will *survive* for 150 minutes. The probability that it will *decay* in 150 minutes is:\nP_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150)\nP_decay(150) = 1 - 0.5607\nP_decay(150) ≈ 0.4393\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nA probability of 0.4393 corresponds to 43.93%. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 52%\nB) 44%\nC) 48%\nD) 40%\n\nThe closest answer is 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
