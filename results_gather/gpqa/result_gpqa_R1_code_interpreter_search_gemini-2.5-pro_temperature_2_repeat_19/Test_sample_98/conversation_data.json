    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to become very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not yet distinguish between the candidates.\n\n### 2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This tells us there are no protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four proposed structures are saturated alkanoic acids, so they are all consistent with this piece of information.\n*   **A signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern means the proton responsible for this signal is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   A set of two neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   A set of three neighboring protons (n=3), which splits the signal into a **quartet**.\n    For a proton to have a `dtq` splitting pattern, its neighbors must be a `CH`, a `CH2` group, and a `CH3` group.\n*   **A different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This proton is also coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   A set of two neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   Another, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into another **triplet**.\n    For a proton to have a `dtt` splitting pattern, its neighbors must be a `CH` group and two different `CH2` groups.\n\n### 3. Evaluating Each Candidate Structure\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons in each molecule, focusing on the methine (CH) protons, as they are most likely to show such complex splitting. The IUPAC names help in visualizing the structures.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: This proton is adjacent to the C2-H (1 proton), the C4-H₂ (2 protons), and the C3-methyl (3 protons). The neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 3H. This would indeed produce a **dtq**.\n*   No proton in this molecule is adjacent to one CH group and two distinct CH₂ groups. Therefore, a `dtt` signal is not expected.\n\n**B) CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: This proton is adjacent to the C2-H₂ (2 protons), the C4-H (1 proton), and the C3-methyl (3 protons). The neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 3H. This would also produce a **dtq**.\n*   No proton in this molecule is adjacent to one CH group and two distinct CH₂ groups. Therefore, a `dtt` signal is not expected.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nThis formula is best interpreted by drawing the structure:\n      CH₂CH₃  CH₂CH₃\n      |       |\nCH₃ - CH -- CH -- CH₂ -- COOH\n    (C5) (C4)   (C3)   (C2)   (C1)\nLet's analyze the two methine (CH) protons:\n*   **H at C4:** This proton is adjacent to the C5-H₃ group (3 protons), the C3-H (1 proton), and the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2 protons). Its neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 3H. This proton will show a **dtq** signal. **(Match)**\n*   **H at C3:** This proton is adjacent to the C2-H₂ group (2 protons), the C4-H (1 proton), and the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2 protons). Its neighbors are one CH group (1H) and two non-equivalent CH₂ groups (2H and 2H). This proton will show a **dtt** signal. **(Match)**\n\n**Conclusion for C:** This structure is the only one that predicts both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nStructure:\n      CH₂CH₃  CH₂CH₃\n      |       |\nCH₃CH₂- CH -- CH -- COOH\n     (C4)   (C3)   (C2)   (C1)\n*   **H at C3:** This proton is adjacent to the C2-H (1 proton), the C4-H₂ (2 protons), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2 protons). Its neighbors are one CH group and two CH₂ groups. This would produce a **dtt**.\n*   **H at C2:** This proton is adjacent to the C3-H (1 proton) and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C2 (2 protons). Its neighbors are 1H and 2H. This would produce a `dt` (doublet of triplets), not a `dtq`. No other proton fits the requirement for a `dtq`.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR splitting patterns, only structure C, **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, can account for the presence of both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
