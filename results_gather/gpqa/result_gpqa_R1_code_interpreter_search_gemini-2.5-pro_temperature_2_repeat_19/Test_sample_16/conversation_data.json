    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and reaction.**\n    The problem involves the calcium-EDTA complex, denoted as $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ or simply $[CaY]^{2-}$, where Y represents the EDTA tetraanion. We are given a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of this complex. The complex will dissociate to a small extent into its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The equilibrium reaction for dissociation is:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Define the equilibrium constant.**\n    The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$):\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    This constant is for the formation reaction: $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$.\n\n    *Note on pH*: The problem specifies an \"ideal pH\". For EDTA, this implies a sufficiently high pH (typically > 10) where EDTA exists predominantly in its fully deprotonated form ($Y^{4-}$). This allows us to use the absolute formation constant ($K_f$) directly without needing to calculate a conditional formation constant ($K'_f$) that accounts for protonated forms of EDTA.\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that forms when the complex dissociates. According to the reaction stoichiometry, the concentration of $Y^{4-}$ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the complex will decrease by 'x'.\n\n| Species         | Initial (I) | Change (C) | Equilibrium (E) |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$    | 0.02 M      | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0 M         | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0 M         | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression.**\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} \\implies 5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Solve for x.**\n    Because the formation constant $K_f$ is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the side of the complex. This means the dissociation will be very slight, and 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make a simplifying assumption:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    Now the equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Rearrange to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Now, solve for x (which is $[Ca^{2+}]$):\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n6.  **Verify the assumption and compare with options.**\n    The calculated value $x = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M is indeed much smaller than 0.02 M, so the simplifying assumption was valid.\n    This value matches option B.\n\nTo confirm the result without approximation, the calculation can be performed using a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Description of the problem:\n# We need to find the concentration of free Ca2+ ions in a 0.02 M solution\n# of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n# The equilibrium is: [Ca(EDTA)]^2- <--> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n# The formation constant Kf is given as 5x10^10.\n# Kf = [[Ca(EDTA)]^2-] / ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-])\n\n# Define the given values\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # M\nKf = 5e10\n\n# Set up the equation based on the ICE table:\n# Let x = [Ca^2+] at equilibrium. Then [EDTA^4-] = x and [[Ca(EDTA)]^2-] = 0.02 - x.\n# Kf = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n# Rearranging gives: Kf * x^2 = 0.02 - x\n# Which is a quadratic equation: Kf * x^2 + x - 0.02 = 0\n\n# Since Kf is very large, we can first use the approximation that x is very small\n# compared to 0.02, so (0.02 - x) is approximately 0.02.\n# Kf ≈ 0.02 / x^2\n# x^2 ≈ 0.02 / Kf\nx_squared_approx = initial_complex_conc / Kf\nx_approx = math.sqrt(x_squared_approx)\n\n# The result is the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca^2+].\nprint(f\"{x_approx:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.32e-07\n\nThe calculation yields a result of $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.

    "The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$.\n\n1.  **Chemical Equation**: The dissociation equilibrium is represented as:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n    We are given that the initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant**: The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$) for the complex, which corresponds to the reverse reaction ($Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$).\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    The problem statement specifies an ideal pH, which means we can assume the EDTA is fully deprotonated as $EDTA^{4-}$ and we don't need to consider its protonated forms. Thus, we can use the given $K_f$ value directly.\n\n3.  **ICE Table**: We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ formed from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species             | Initial (I) | Change (C) | Equilibrium (E) |\n|---------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02 M      | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0 M         | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0 M         | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Calculation**: Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplification**: Because the value of $K_f$ is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium lies heavily towards the formation of the complex. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, and 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. Therefore, we can make the approximation that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Solve for x**:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is therefore approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. The Python code output confirmed this result.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: Comparing the calculated value with the given options:\n    A) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    B) 6.3x10^-7 M\n    C) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    D) 2.0x10^-2 M\n\nThe calculated concentration matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
