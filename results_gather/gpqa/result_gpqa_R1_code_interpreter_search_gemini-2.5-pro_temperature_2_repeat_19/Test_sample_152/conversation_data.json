These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nA) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nB) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\nC) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nD) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile Source):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH2(COOCH3)2`. The two hydrogens on the central carbon (α-hydrogens) are highly acidic because the resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by resonance with both adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Base:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that deprotonates the dimethyl malonate to form the nucleophilic enolate: `Na+ [CH(COOCH3)2]−`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tol-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH3`, where `p-Tol` is a p-tolyl group (a benzene ring substituted with a methyl group at the para position). The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Enolate formation:** `CH2(COOCH3)2 + NaOEt → Na+ [CH(COOCH3)2]− + EtOH`\n    *   **Step 2: Michael Addition:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The π electrons from the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, and then onto the carbonyl oxygen, forming a new, resonance-stabilized enolate.\n        *   `p-Tol-CH(β)=CH-COOCH3 + [CH(COOCH3)2]− → p-Tol-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH=C(O−)OCH3` (one resonance form of the intermediate enolate).\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation:** The intermediate enolate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final, stable product.\n        *   `p-Tol-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-C−H-COOCH3 + EtOH → p-Tol-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH2-COOCH3 + EtO−`\n\n3.  **Identify Product A:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `(CH3OOC)2CH-CH(p-Tol)-CH2-COOCH3`.\n    *   Let's name this compound based on the options. The name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` describes a propane chain `(C3-C2-C1)` with substituents.\n        *   At C1: Two methoxycarbonyl (`-COOCH3`) groups.\n        *   At C2: One p-tolyl group.\n        *   At C3: One methoxycarbonyl group.\n        *   Let's build this structure: `(CH3OOC)-CH2(C3)-CH(p-Tol)(C2)-CH(COOCH3)2(C1)`.\n    *   This structure matches our derived product. Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which is a variant of the Michael addition. The enamine acts as the Michael donor.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH3-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n    *   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is followed by an acidic workup (`H3O+`).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and generates an iminium ion intermediate and a carbanion stabilized by the nitrile group.\n    *   **Step 2: Protonation:** The carbanion is protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n    *   **Step 3: Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (`H3O+`) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a ketone. The overall result is the alkylation of the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone).\n\n3.  **Identify Product B:**\n    *   The starting ketone is cyclohexanone. The alkylating agent is derived from `CH3-CH=CH-CN`.\n    *   The group added to the α-carbon (C2) of cyclohexanone is `-CH(CH3)-CH2CN`.\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n    *   Let's name this product: The principal functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`), which has higher priority than a ketone. The main chain is a butanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile: `N≡C(1)-C(2)H2-C(3)H(subst.)-C(4)H3`.\n    *   The substituent at C3 is the `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    *   Therefore, the name is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.\n    *   The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, is the enol tautomer. Under acidic hydrolysis conditions, the keto form is the major, stable product.\n    *   Thus, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### **Reaction 3: (C)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where we need to identify the starting Michael donor (C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH2=CH-COCH3`.\n    *   **Base:** KOH in water.\n\n2.  **Determine Reactant C using Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   \"Break\" the molecule at the bond formed during the Michael addition. This is the bond between the Michael donor and the Michael acceptor.\n    *   The fragment from the acceptor (MVK) is the `3-oxobutyl` group (`-CH2-CH2-COCH3`). This group comes from the addition to `CH2(β)=CH(α)-COCH3`, where a nucleophile adds to the β-carbon and a proton adds to the α-carbon.\n    *   The bond is formed between C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Therefore, the Michael donor (reactant C) must be the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` part.\n    *   The hydrogens at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic (they are α to two carbonyl groups) and are readily removed by the base (KOH) to form a highly stabilized enolate, which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C:**\n    *   Based on the retrosynthesis, reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nComparing this with the given options, we find that option A matches all three results.\n\n<<<A>>>"
