    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the optical activity of each compound. A compound is optically active if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This is typically due to the presence of a chiral center and the absence of any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(CH3)=CH-Cl`.\n    *   The carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C`) and the atoms directly attached to it lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is planar.\n    *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), making it achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name itself provides the key information. The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (the bridgehead carbons 3a and 7a).\n    *   The core structure, `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione`, is a norbornane skeleton fused with a cyclic anhydride ring. This parent structure has a plane of symmetry that passes through the methano bridge carbon (C8).\n    *   However, the substituent at C8 is an unsymmetrical chloromethylene group (`=CHCl`). This substituent destroys the plane of symmetry of the parent molecule.\n    *   Since the molecule has stereocenters and lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is chiral.\n    *   The name refers to a single, specific enantiomer. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   When a molecule has two identical stereocenters with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is a *meso* compound.\n    *   *Meso* compounds are achiral because they possess an internal element of symmetry. In this case, there is a center of inversion halfway between C2 and C3. An eclipsed conformation also shows a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Because it is a meso compound, it is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It has two identical stereocenters, both with the (R) configuration.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n    *   This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Since it is a chiral molecule, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -H, (2) -OH, (3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=` and (4) the ring segment `-CH2-CH2-CH=`. These two pathways around the ring are different. Thus, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor `(1s,3s,5s)` implies that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the chair conformation. The all-cis isomer can exist in two chair forms that interconvert: one with all three -OH groups in axial positions, and one with all three in equatorial positions.\n    *   Both conformers possess multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H group, bisecting the ring. The molecule also possesses a C3 axis of rotation.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral, regardless of the conformation.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   Structure: `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. The molecule is also known as cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. A chiral center must be a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   None of the carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are chiral.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2-hybridized and not a chiral center.\n    *   The -CH2- group has two identical hydrogen atoms and is not a chiral center.\n    *   The -CH(CH3)2 carbon is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. It also does not exhibit other types of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). Furthermore, the molecule has accessible conformations that possess a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
