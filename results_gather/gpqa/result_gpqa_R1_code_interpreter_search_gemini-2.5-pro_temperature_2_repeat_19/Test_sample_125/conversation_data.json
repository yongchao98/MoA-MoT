    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the products of two chemical reactions and how they would be observed using two different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reaction:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single enantiomer. The stereocenter is at carbon 5 (C5).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃\n    *   The chirality at C5 is specified as (S).\n*   **Reaction Process:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This reaction creates a *new* stereocenter at C3. The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction and its configuration remains (S).\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces. This leads to the formation of two possible configurations (R or S) at the new stereocenter (C3).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have two stereocenters. Their configurations are (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S). Since one stereocenter is the same (S at C5) and the other is different (R vs. S at C3), these two molecules are **diastereomers**. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral molecule.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n*   **Reaction Process:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol. The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These are non-superimposable mirror images and are a pair of **enantiomers**. This pair is formed as a racemic mixture (equal amounts of both).\n    *   **(2R, 4S):** This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral and is not optically active. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (just flipped over).\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S) form)\n*   **Relationship:** The product mixture contains a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains the two products from Reaction I and the three products from Reaction II, making a total of **5 unique compounds**.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Separation Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their polarity. It uses a polar stationary phase and a non-polar mobile phase.\n*   **Enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, including polarity. Therefore, they **cannot** be separated by normal-phase HPLC and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers:** Diastereomers have different physical properties, including polarity, and thus **can** be separated.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the products from Reaction II result in a total of 2 peaks.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The two peaks from Reaction I products are structurally very different from the two peaks from Reaction II products, so they will all elute at different times. Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Separation Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). This chiral environment allows for the separation of enantiomers because they interact differently with the CSP, forming temporary diastereomeric complexes with different stabilities.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:** A chiral column can distinguish between all stereoisomers.\n    *   The five distinct stereoisomers in the mixture are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Since all five of these compounds are stereochemically different, the chiral column will be able to resolve all of them into separate peaks.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = **4**\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = **5**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
