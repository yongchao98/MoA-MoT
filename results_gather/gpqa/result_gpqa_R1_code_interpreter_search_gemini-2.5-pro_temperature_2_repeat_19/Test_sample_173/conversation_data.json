    "An atomic nucleus of mass M, with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV, is initially at rest. This nucleus undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment's rest mass (m1) is twice that of the other (m2). The total rest mass of the two fragments (m1 + m2) is 99% of the initial mass M. We need to find the difference between the relativistically calculated kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and its classically calculated value.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n**1. Determine the Masses and Energies**\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus: `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The relationship between fragment masses: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of fragment rest-masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nLet's find the rest masses `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`:\nSubstitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation:\n`(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1): `m1c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m2): `m2c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   Sum of fragments' rest-mass energies: `198 GeV + 99 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments, is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final total rest energy.\n`Q = Initial_Rest_Energy - Final_Rest_Energy`\n`Q = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nThis released energy is the total kinetic energy of the fragments: `T_total = T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Relativistic Calculation of T1 (Correct Value)**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero. This means their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n`p1 = p2` (in magnitude)\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_rest * c^2)^2`, where E is the total energy (`E = T + m_rest * c^2`).\nFrom this, `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_rest * c^2)^2`.\n\nSince `p1 = p2`, we have `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`:\n`E1^2 - (m1c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2c^2)^2`\n`(T1 + m1c^2)^2 - (m1c^2)^2 = (T2 + m2c^2)^2 - (m2c^2)^2`\n\nExpanding the terms:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2c^2)`\n\nWe know `T2 = Q - T1`. Substituting this into the equation:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1c^2) = (Q - T1)^2 + 2*(Q - T1)*(m2c^2)`\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1c^2) = Q^2 - 2*Q*T1 + T1^2 + 2*Q*(m2c^2) - 2*T1*(m2c^2)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out. We can rearrange to solve for T1:\n`2*T1*(m1c^2) + 2*Q*T1 + 2*T1*(m2c^2) = Q^2 + 2*Q*(m2c^2)`\n`2*T1 * (m1c^2 + m2c^2 + Q) = Q * (Q + 2*m2c^2)`\n\nRecognize that `m1c^2 + m2c^2 + Q` is the initial rest energy `Mc^2`.\n`2*T1 * (Mc^2) = Q * (Q + 2*m2c^2)`\n`T1 = (Q * (Q + 2*m2c^2)) / (2 * Mc^2)`\n\nNow, we will use Python to perform the calculation with the given values.\n\n```python\n# Values in GeV\nMc2 = 300.0\nm1c2 = 198.0\nm2c2 = 99.0\nQ = 3.0\n\n# Relativistic calculation for T1\nT1_relativistic = (Q * (Q + 2 * m2c2)) / (2 * Mc2)\n\n# Classical (non-relativistic) calculation for T1\n# From conservation of momentum (p1=p2) and classical formulas (p=sqrt(2mT)):\n# m1 * T1 = m2 * T2\n# m1 * T1 = m2 * (Q - T1)\n# (m1 + m2) * T1 = m2 * Q\n# T1 = Q * (m2 / (m1 + m2))\n# This is equivalent to T1_classical = Q * (m2c2 / (m1c2 + m2c2))\nT1_classical = Q * (m2c2 / (m1c2 + m2c2))\n\n# Difference in MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV)\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic - T1_classical) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nRelativistic T1: 1.005 GeV\nClassical T1: 1.000 GeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n```\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value of T1 and the classical approximation is 5.0 MeV. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### 1. Calculate Fragment Masses and Energies\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The fission products are two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n*   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nLet's substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation:\n`(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, we can find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments in GeV:\n*   Rest energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`): `m1c^2 = 0.66 * Mc^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest energy of the less massive fragment (`m2`): `m2c^2 = 0.33 * Mc^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final total rest energy. This released energy is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T_total = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nSo, the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate Kinetic Energy T1 (Relativistic - Correct Method)\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by the law of conservation of momentum, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n`p1 = p2`\n\nUsing the relativistic energy-momentum relation `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, where `E = T + mc^2`:\n`(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)`\n\nSince `p1^2 = p2^2`, we have:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2c^2)`\n\nSubstitute `T2 = Q - T1`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1c^2) = (Q - T1)^2 + 2*(Q - T1)*(m2c^2)`\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1c^2) = Q^2 - 2*Q*T1 + T1^2 + 2*Q*(m2c^2) - 2*T1*(m2c^2)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out. We can rearrange to solve for T1:\n`2*T1*(m1c^2) + 2*Q*T1 + 2*T1*(m2c^2) = Q^2 + 2*Q*(m2c^2)`\n`T1 * (2*m1c^2 + 2*m2c^2 + 2*Q) = Q * (Q + 2*m2c^2)`\n`T1 * 2 * (m1c^2 + m2c^2 + Q) = Q * (Q + 2*m2c^2)`\nNotice that `m1c^2 + m2c^2 + Q = 297 GeV + 3 GeV = 300 GeV = Mc^2`.\n`T1 * 2 * (Mc^2) = Q * (Q + 2*m2c^2)`\n\n`T1_relativistic = (Q * (Q + 2*m2c^2)) / (2 * Mc^2)`\n`T1_relativistic = (3 GeV * (3 GeV + 2 * 99 GeV)) / (2 * 300 GeV)`\n`T1_relativistic = (3 * (3 + 198)) / 600 GeV`\n`T1_relativistic = (3 * 201) / 600 GeV`\n`T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate Kinetic Energy T1 (Classical Approximation)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`, so `p^2 = 2mT`.\nFrom conservation of momentum `p1^2 = p2^2`:\n`2 * m1 * T1 = 2 * m2 * T2`\n`m1 * T1 = m2 * (Q - T1)`\n`(m1 + m2) * T1 = m2 * Q`\n`T1_classical = Q * (m2 / (m1 + m2))`\n\nUsing the rest energies (which are proportional to masses):\n`T1_classical = Q * (m2c^2 / (m1c^2 + m2c^2))`\n`T1_classical = 3 GeV * (99 GeV / (198 GeV + 99 GeV))`\n`T1_classical = 3 GeV * (99 / 297)`\n`T1_classical = 3 GeV * (1 / 3) = 1.000 GeV`\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the two calculated values is:\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nConvert the difference to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<A>>>"
