    "**1. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically bromination, on a series of substituted benzene rings (`C6H5-X`). The goal is to determine the yield of the *para*-isomer for each starting material and then arrange the substances in increasing order of this yield.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents (X)**\n\nThe substituent on the benzene ring determines where the incoming bromine atom will attach (directing effect) and how fast the reaction will be (activating/deactivating effect).\n\n*   **Group 1: Activating, Ortho/Para-Directing:** These groups donate electron density to the ring and direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n\n*   **Group 2: Deactivating, Ortho/Para-Directing:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring (making it less reactive) but still direct to the ortho and para positions due to resonance effects involving lone pairs.\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\n*   **Group 3: Deactivating, Meta-Directing:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n**3. Predict the Para-Isomer Yield for Each Group**\n\n*   **Group 3 (Meta-Directors): Lowest Para Yield**\n    Substances 2, 4, and 6 will predominantly form the *meta*-brominated product. The yield of the *para*-isomer will be very small. To order them, we need to consider the strength of their deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group leads to higher selectivity for the meta position, meaning an even lower yield for the ortho and para isomers.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be the lowest for the strongest deactivator and increase from there.\n    *   Order of increasing para-yield: `-NO2` < `-COOH` < `-COOC2H5`\n    *   This corresponds to the substance order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   **Groups 1 & 2 (Ortho/Para-Directors): Higher Para Yield**\n    Substances 1, 3, and 5 will form a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The amount of para product will be significant. To order them, we need to analyze the factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution.\n\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** A larger substituent will sterically block the ortho positions, making an attack at the less-hindered para position more favorable. The steric bulk increases in the order `-Cl` < `-CH3` < `-C2H5`. Based on this alone, one might incorrectly predict the para-yield order to be `3 < 1 < 5`.\n\n    *   **Electronic Effects:**\n        *   For **Chlorobenzene (3)**, the chlorine atom has a strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect (-I) and a weaker resonance-donating effect (+R). The inductive effect strongly deactivates the adjacent ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor heavily favors para substitution, leading to a very high para-to-ortho ratio (typical para yield is ~87%).\n        *   For **Toluene (1)** and **Ethylbenzene (5)**, the alkyl groups are activating. The primary factor differentiating their para/ortho ratio is sterics. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased bulk hinders ortho attack more for ethylbenzene, leading to a slightly higher proportion of the para product compared to toluene.\n            *   Toluene (1): ~62% para yield.\n            *   Ethylbenzene (5): ~63% para yield.\n\n    *   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-yield for the ortho/para directors is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n    *   This corresponds to the substance order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**4. Assemble the Final Order**\n\nNow, we combine the two sets of rankings. The meta-directing compounds will have much lower para yields than the ortho/para-directing compounds.\n\n*   Lowest yields (meta-directors): `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Highest yields (ortho/para-directors): `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nCombining them gives the complete order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
