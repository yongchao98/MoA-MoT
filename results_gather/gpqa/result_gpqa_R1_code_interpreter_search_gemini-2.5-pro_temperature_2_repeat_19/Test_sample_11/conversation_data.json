    "Here's a breakdown of the physics and calculations involved in solving this problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe decay of a stationary particle into two product particles is governed by two fundamental conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n**2. Define the States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A single pion (`Pi+`) at rest.\n    *   Initial Energy (`E_i`): Since the pion is at rest, its energy is its rest mass energy, `E_i = m_π * c^2`.\n    *   Initial Momentum (`p_i`): Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is `p_i = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:** A muon (`mu+`) and a neutrino (`ν`).\n    *   Final Energy (`E_f`): The sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino, `E_f = E_μ + E_ν`. The total energy of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and its rest mass energy (`m*c^2`).\n    *   Final Momentum (`p_f`): The vector sum of the momenta of the muon and the neutrino, `p_f = p_μ + p_ν`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   `p_i = p_f` => `0 = p_μ + p_ν`\n    *   This implies `p_μ = -p_ν`. The muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude `p`. So, `|p_μ| = |p_ν| = p`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   `E_i = E_f` => `m_π * c^2 = E_μ + E_ν`\n    *   The total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    *   For the muon (`μ+`): `E_μ = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_μ * c^2)^2)`\n    *   For the neutrino (`ν`): Neutrinos have negligible mass, so we assume `m_ν = 0`. This simplifies their energy formula to `E_ν = sqrt((p*c)^2 + 0) = p*c`. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the neutrino is `KE_ν = p*c`.\n\n**4. Solve for the Momentum and Energies**\n\nSubstitute the energy expressions back into the conservation of energy equation:\n`m_π * c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_μ * c^2)^2) + p*c`\n\nTo solve for `p*c` (the momentum-energy term), we rearrange and square the equation:\n`m_π * c^2 - p*c = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_μ * c^2)^2)`\n`(m_π * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_μ * c^2)^2`\n`(m_π*c^2)^2 - 2(m_π*c^2)(p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_μ*c^2)^2`\n\nThe `(p*c)^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`(m_π*c^2)^2 - 2(m_π*c^2)(p*c) = (m_μ*c^2)^2`\n\nNow, we can solve for `p*c`:\n`p*c = [(m_π*c^2)^2 - (m_μ*c^2)^2] / [2 * m_π*c^2]`\n\nLet's perform the calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the momentum-energy term (p*c) in MeV\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its total energy, which is p*c\nke_nu = pc\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy\n# KE = E_total - m*c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2) - m*c^2\nke_mu = np.sqrt(pc**2 + m_mu_c2**2) - m_mu_c2\n\n# Print the results, formatted to two decimal places to match the options\nprint(f\"KE of Muon (μ+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of Neutrino (ν): {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKE of Muon (μ+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of Neutrino (ν): 29.79 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (`mu+`) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (`nu`) (rounding 29.79 up). These values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a classic particle physics problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    The initial pion (`Pi+`) is stationary, so the initial total momentum is zero. Due to the conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the product particles must also be zero. This means the muon (`mu+`) and the neutrino (`nu`) must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    Let `p_mu` be the momentum of the muon and `p_nu` be the momentum of the neutrino.\n    *   `p_initial = 0`\n    *   `p_final = p_mu + p_nu` (vector sum)\n    *   `p_initial = p_final`  =>  `p_mu + p_nu = 0`  => `p_mu = -p_nu`\n    *   This implies their magnitudes are equal: `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. The initial energy is the rest mass energy of the stationary pion. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    *   `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`\n    *   `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\n    *   `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy:**\n    The total energy (E) of a particle is given by the relativistic formula `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`, where `p` is momentum, `m` is rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   For the muon (`mu+`): `E_mu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)`\n    *   For the neutrino (`nu`): Neutrinos have a very small mass, which is considered negligible in this context (`m_nu ≈ 0`). So its energy is `E_nu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + 0) = p*c`. The kinetic energy of the neutrino is therefore `KE_nu = E_nu = p*c`.\n\n4.  **Solving for Momentum and Energy:**\n    Substitute the energy expressions back into the conservation of energy equation:\n    `m_pi * c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2) + p*c`\n\n    We can now solve for the unknown momentum term, `p*c`. Rearranging the equation:\n    `m_pi * c^2 - p*c = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)`\n\n    Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    `(m_pi * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    `(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi * c^2)(p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\n    The `(p*c)^2` terms cancel out:\n    `(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi * c^2)(p*c) = (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\n    Solving for `p*c`:\n    `p*c = [(m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2] / [2 * (m_pi * c^2)]`\n\n5.  **Calculating the Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   The kinetic energy of the neutrino is `KE_nu = p*c`.\n    *   The kinetic energy of the muon is `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c^2`. We know that `E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - E_nu`, so `KE_mu = (m_pi * c^2 - p*c) - m_mu * c^2`.\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   `m_pi * c^2 = 139.6` MeV\n*   `m_mu * c^2 = 105.7` MeV\n\nThe following Python script will perform these calculations precisely.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate p*c, which is the momentum of each product particle multiplied by c.\n# From the conservation laws, pc = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi). Note that all mass terms here are actually mass-energy equivalents.\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its total energy, which is pc.\nke_nu = pc\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total relativistic energy minus its rest mass energy.\n# KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c^2 = sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2) - m_mu*c^2\nke_mu = np.sqrt(pc**2 + m_mu_c2**2) - m_mu_c2\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places to match the format of the options.\n# The standard convention is to list the muon's KE first, then the neutrino's.\nprint(f\"KE of Muon (μ+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of Neutrino (ν): {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nThe output from the code shows:\n*   Kinetic Energy of the muon (`mu+`) is **4.12 MeV**.\n*   Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (`nu`) is **29.78 MeV**, which rounds to **29.8 MeV**.\n\nThese calculated values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The analysis of the particle decay `Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu` using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum is correct.\n\n1.  **Initial State**:\n    *   Particle: Stationary pion (`Pi+`)\n    *   Energy: Rest mass energy, `E_i = m_π * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n    *   Momentum: `p_i = 0`\n\n2.  **Final State**:\n    *   Particles: Muon (`mu+`) and neutrino (`nu`)\n    *   Momentum Conservation: `p_μ = -p_ν`.
