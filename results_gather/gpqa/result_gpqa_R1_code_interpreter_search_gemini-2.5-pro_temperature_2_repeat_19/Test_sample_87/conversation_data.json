    "*   **Analysis of the Scenario:**\n    *   The experiment involves administering an antigen (rotavirus capsid proteins) orally.\n    *   The antigen reaches the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut, specialized in initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n    *   The observation of fluorescence in Peyer's patches confirms antigen uptake.\n    *   Cells in these patches are found to be proliferating, which indicates an active immune response, specifically the clonal expansion of lymphocytes that have recognized the antigen.\n    *   The crucial piece of information is the sequencing result: \"high variability\" in the **variable heavy chain gene** of these proliferating cells. This means that among the population of B cells responding to the rotavirus protein, many small changes (mutations) have accumulated in the part of the gene that codes for the antigen-binding site.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the Options:**\n    *   **A) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a biological process that occurs in activated B cells within specialized microenvironments called germinal centers, which are found in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. SHM intentionally introduces point mutations at a very high rate into the variable regions (V, D, and J segments) of the immunoglobulin genes. The purpose is to create variants of the original antibody, some of which will have a higher affinity for the antigen. This process directly leads to \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells during an active immune response. This perfectly matches the observations.\n    *   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that generates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow during the development of B cells, *before* they ever encounter an antigen. It assembles one V, one D, and one J gene segment to create a unique variable region. While this process creates diversity across the entire B cell repertoire, it is not what is happening to an already-activated, proliferating population of B cells in a Peyer's patch in response to a specific antigen.\n    *   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. However, CSR changes the **constant** region of the heavy chain, not the variable region. This switches the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is common in the gut) and thus its effector function, but it does not alter the antigen-binding specificity or increase the variability of the *variable* region gene.\n    *   **D) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, a cascade of proteins that helps to eliminate pathogens. It is an effector mechanism and is not involved in generating genetic diversity in B cell receptors.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating B cell population in a secondary lymphoid organ after antigen exposure is the definitive hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
