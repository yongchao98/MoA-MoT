    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown white solid:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the most abundant isotope version of the molecule is 156 u.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). The ratio of the intensities of the M+ to M+2 peaks is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This specific isotopic pattern is a classic indicator for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule, as natural chlorine consists of two main isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%), in a roughly 3:1 ratio.\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (containing ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ to 2700 cm⁻¹ is observed. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   A strong, sharp peak is seen at 1720 cm⁻¹. This frequency falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When considered with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The value is consistent with an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   **Signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield (deshielded), which is typical for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid group (-CO**O**H). Its integration of 1H confirms it represents a single proton. It is a singlet as there are no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Signals at 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern is crucial: two doublets, each integrating to two protons. This symmetry (two sets of two equivalent protons) is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The two substituents are different, causing the two sets of protons on the ring to have slightly different chemical environments. They couple only with their immediate neighbors, resulting in two distinct doublets.\n    *   Conclusion from NMR: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From MS, we know we have a chlorine atom (MW=35.5 approx).\n    *   From IR and NMR, we have a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   From NMR, we have a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   Combining these facts, the structure must be a benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group in a *para* (1,4) arrangement. This compound is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n    Let's check this proposed structure against the data and the other options.\n\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring, which would produce a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with four distinct signals in the aromatic region, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloroformate, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H IR peak and the acidic proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n    *   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. Its spectral data would be entirely different (e.g., an aldehyde proton peak around 9-10 ppm in NMR).\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure perfectly matches all the data.\n        *   **Formula:** C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   **Molecular Weight:** (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches the M+ peak. The M+2 peak at 158 is consistent with the ³⁷Cl isotope.\n        *   **Functional Group:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR.\n        *   **Substitution Pattern:** It is *para*-disubstituted, matching the ¹H NMR pattern of two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
