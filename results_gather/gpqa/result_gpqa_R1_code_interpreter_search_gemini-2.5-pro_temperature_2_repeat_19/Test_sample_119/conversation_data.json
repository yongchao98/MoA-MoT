    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    `plx ∝ 1/d` or `d ∝ 1/plx`\n    For simplicity in calculations, we can write `d = 1/plx` by choosing appropriate units (e.g., distance in parsecs and parallax in arcseconds).\n\n2.  **Model the distribution of stars.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere. `ρ` represents the number of stars per unit volume.\n    `ρ = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in a given volume.**\n    Consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer (Earth). Let the inner radius of the shell be `d` and its thickness be a small amount `dd`.\n    *   The surface area of this sphere is `A = 4πd²`.\n    *   The volume of the thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the volume of the shell multiplied by the constant star density `ρ`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    This equation tells us that the number of stars in a small distance range `dd` at distance `d` is proportional to `d²`.\n\n4.  **Translate the relationship from distance to parallax.**\n    Our goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) changes with `plx`. We need to substitute `d` and `dd` in the equation for `dN` with expressions involving `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n        Therefore, `dd = -(1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a given range, we care about the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Substitute and find the final relationship.**\n    Now, substitute `d = 1/plx` and `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)` into our equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Interpret the result.**\n    The expression `dN/d(plx)` represents the number of stars per unit range of parallax. From the equation above, we can see:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we find that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the parallax.\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
