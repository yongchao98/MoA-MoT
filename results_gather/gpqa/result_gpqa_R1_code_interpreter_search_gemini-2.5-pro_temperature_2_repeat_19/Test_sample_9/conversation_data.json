    "*   **Analysis of the Options**\n\n    1.  **Analyze Option a): An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n        This is our reference point. Earth has an average density of approximately 5.51 g/cm³. We'll denote this density as ρ_Earth.\n\n    2.  **Analyze Option b): A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.**\n        The problem explicitly states the density of this planet is about 5.5 g/cm³. This is very close to Earth's density. So, ρ_b ≈ ρ_Earth.\n        (Note: For a planet with the same composition as Earth but twice the mass, we would expect it to be significantly denser due to gravitational compression. The fact that its density is similar to Earth's implies it must have a different, less intrinsically dense composition, perhaps with more light elements or silicates and a smaller iron core).\n\n    3.  **Analyze Option c): A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n        This is the key concept. The planet has the same building materials as Earth (e.g., iron, nickel, silicates) but is much more massive. The immense gravity of this 5-Earth-mass planet will compress its materials much more than Earth's gravity does. This effect, known as self-compression or gravitational compression, forces the atoms closer together, resulting in a significantly higher average density. Therefore, its density will be greater than Earth's density. So, ρ_c > ρ_Earth.\n\n    4.  **Analyze Option d): A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n        This is the opposite of case (c). This planet has the same composition as Earth but is less massive. With weaker gravity, the materials will be less compressed compared to Earth. Consequently, its average density will be lower than Earth's density. So, ρ_d < ρ_Earth.\n\n*   **Comparison and Conclusion**\n\n    Let's compare the densities we've deduced for each option:\n    *   Density of (a): ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density of (b): ρ_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density of (c): ρ_c > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to higher mass and compression)\n    *   Density of (d): ρ_d < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to lower mass and less compression)\n\n    By comparing these, it is clear that the planet described in option (c) will have the highest density.\n\n<<<A>>>"
