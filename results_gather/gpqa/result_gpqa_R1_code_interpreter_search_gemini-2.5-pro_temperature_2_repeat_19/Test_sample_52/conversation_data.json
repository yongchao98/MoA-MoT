    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Provided Information:**\n    *   **Core Structure:** \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents.\n    *   **Functional Group:** \"FTIR spectrum... shows... an ester group\". This tells us the molecule contains a -COO- functional group. An ester has the general formula R-COO-R'.\n    *   **Proton NMR (¹H NMR) Data:** This is the most detailed piece of information.\n        *   **Total Signals:** Six signals.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". A di-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄) has 4 protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, specifically para (1,4) substitution, where the two substituents are different. This gives an AA'BB' system, which often appears as two distinct signals (doublets).\n        *   **Vinyl Protons:** \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This splitting pattern (doublet and doublet of quartets) is a classic signature for a `-CH=CH-CH₃` group.\n            *   Let's label the group: Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH₃(c).\n            *   H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and then by the three H(c) protons into a quartet. This results in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n            *   H(a) is only split by H(b) into a doublet (d). This perfectly matches the description.\n        *   **Methyl Protons:** \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\".\n            *   One methyl group is the one from our proposed `-CH=CH-CH₃` (propenyl) group. Its protons (H(c)) are adjacent to one vinyl proton (H(b)), so they would appear as a doublet.\n            *   The second methyl group must be part of the ester, as there are no other places for it.\n        *   **Absence of Signals:** \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\". This is a crucial negative constraint, ruling out many possibilities like ethyl esters (`-COOCH₂CH₃`) or longer alkyl chains.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have a C₆H₄ ring.\n    *   We have a `-CH=CH-CH₃` group (propenyl group) as one substituent. This accounts for the vinyl signals and one of the methyl signals. Its formula is C₃H₅.\n    *   We have an ester group and the second methyl group. The \"no -CH₂-\" rule means the methyl must be directly attached to the ester functionality. This leaves two possibilities for how the ester is attached to the ring:\n        *   **Possibility A:** Methyl benzoate derivative. The ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon. The substituent is `-COOCH₃` (methyl ester). The methyl protons here would be a singlet, as they have no adjacent protons.\n        *   **Possibility B:** Phenyl acetate derivative. The ring is attached to the ester oxygen. The substituent is `-O-CO-CH₃` (acetoxy group). The methyl protons here would also be a singlet.\n    *   Both possibilities fit the NMR data:\n        *   2 aromatic signals (from the para-C₆H₄ ring).\n        *   2 vinyl signals (d and dq from the propenyl group).\n        *   2 methyl signals (one doublet from the propenyl group, one singlet from the ester methyl).\n        *   Total of 6 signals.\n        *   No -CH₂ groups.\n\n3.  **Determine the Chemical Formula:**\n    Now, let's calculate the molecular formula for the structure we've deduced. It doesn't matter which ester linkage (Possibility A or B) we use, as the total atoms will be the same. Let's build the formula from the pieces:\n    *   Benzene ring part: `C₆H₄`\n    *   Propenyl substituent: `C₃H₅`\n    *   Ester-methyl part: This consists of the remaining atoms: one methyl group (`CH₃`) and the ester atoms (`COO`). Total for this part: `C₂H₃O₂`.\n    *   Let's add them up:\n        *   Carbons (C): 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) and Eliminate Other Options:**\n    The DBE (also called double bond equivalent) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   **Expected DBE from structure:** A benzene ring has 4 DBE (1 ring + 3 π bonds). The vinyl C=C has 1 DBE. The ester C=O has 1 DBE. Total expected DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   **DBE of C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. This matches perfectly.\n    *   **Check the other options:**\n        *   `C₁₁H₁₄O₂`: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. This DBE is too low. It cannot have a benzene ring, a C=C bond, and a C=O bond simultaneously.\n        *   `C₁₂H₁₂O₂`: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. This DBE is too high. It would require an additional ring or π bond not accounted for by the spectral data.\n        *   `C₁₂H₁₄O₂`: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6. While the DBE matches, this formula has a `CH₂` group more than `C₁₁H₁₂O₂`. The problem explicitly states there are **no -CH₂ groups**, so this formula is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data (aromatic ring, ester, specific vinyl and methyl signals, and no CH₂ groups) and the rules of chemical structures (DBE) is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The compound is likely methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate or 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
