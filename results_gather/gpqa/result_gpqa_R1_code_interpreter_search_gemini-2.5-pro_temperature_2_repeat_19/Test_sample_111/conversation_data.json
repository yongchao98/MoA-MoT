    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Normalize the Initial State\n\nThe given state is `|ψ⟩ = N * [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]`, where `N` is the normalization constant.\nIn the standard basis where `|up⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ` and `|down⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ`, the state vector is:\n`ψ = N * [1+i, 2-i]ᵀ`\n\nFor the state to be normalized, its inner product with itself, `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`, must be equal to 1.\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = |N|² * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)] = 1`\n`|N|² * [(1² + 1²) + (2² + (-1)²)] = 1`\n`|N|² * [2 + 5] = 1`\n`|N|² * 7 = 1`\n`|N| = 1/√7`\n\nWe can choose the real and positive constant `N = 1/√7`.\nSo, the normalized state `|α⟩` is:\n`|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩] = (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]ᵀ`\n\n### 2. Define the Operator and Find its Eigenstates/Eigenvalues\n\nThe operator `A` has matrix elements `Aij = ħ/2` if `i ≠ j` and `0` otherwise. This gives the matrix:\n`A = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix (`σ_x`).\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (`λ`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues: `λ₁ = +ħ/2` and `λ₂ = -ħ/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   For `λ₁ = +ħ/2`:\n    `(A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0`\n    `(ħ/2) * [[-1, 1], [1, -1]] * [x, y]ᵀ = 0`\n    This leads to the equation `-x + y = 0`, or `x = y`. The normalized eigenvector is `|v₁⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 1]ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up⟩ + |down⟩)`.\n\n*   For `λ₂ = -ħ/2`:\n    `(A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0`\n    `(ħ/2) * [[1, 1], [1, 1]] * [x, y]ᵀ = 0`\n    This leads to the equation `x + y = 0`, or `x = -y`. The normalized eigenvector is `|v₂⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, -1]ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up⟩ - |down⟩)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the particle in an eigenstate is the square of the magnitude of the projection of `|α⟩` onto that eigenstate.\n\n*   **Probability P₁ (for eigenvalue λ₁ = +ħ/2):**\n    `P₁ = |⟨v₁|α⟩|²`\n    `⟨v₁|α⟩ = {(1/√2) * [1, 1]} ⋅ {(1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]ᵀ}`\n    `⟨v₁|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)]`\n    `⟨v₁|α⟩ = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14`\n    `P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n\n*   **Probability P₂ (for eigenvalue λ₂ = -ħ/2):**\n    `P₂ = |⟨v₂|α⟩|²`\n    `⟨v₂|α⟩ = {(1/√2) * [1, -1]} ⋅ {(1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]ᵀ}`\n    `⟨v₂|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)]`\n    `⟨v₂|α⟩ = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14`\n    `P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. We check that they sum to 1: `9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Average Value\n\nThe average (or expectation) value `⟨A⟩` can be calculated in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: Sum of eigenvalues weighted by their probabilities.**\n    `⟨A⟩ = λ₁P₁ + λ₂P₂`\n    `⟨A⟩ = (+ħ/2)(9/14) + (-ħ/2)(5/14)`\n    `⟨A⟩ = (ħ/2) * (9/14 - 5/14) = (ħ/2) * (4/14) = (ħ/2) * (2/7)`\n    `⟨A⟩ = ħ/7`\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the formula `⟨A⟩ = ⟨α|A|α⟩`.**\n    `A|α⟩ = {(ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]} * {(1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]ᵀ} = (ħ/(2√7)) * [2-i, 1+i]ᵀ`\n    `⟨α|A|α⟩ = {(1/√7) * [1-i, 2+i]} ⋅ {(ħ/(2√7)) * [2-i, 1+i]ᵀ}`\n    `⟨α|A|α⟩ = (ħ/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n    `⟨α|A|α⟩ = (ħ/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]`\n    `⟨α|A|α⟩ = (ħ/14) * [1 - 3i + 1 + 3i] = (ħ/14) * 2 = ħ/7`\n\nBoth methods yield `⟨A⟩ = ħ/7`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately `0.64` and `0.36`, and the average value is `ħ/7`. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
