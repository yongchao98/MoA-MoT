    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants.**\n    *   **The Dienophile**: We are given a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in the ¹H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in the ¹³C NMR.\n        *   A single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm suggests two equivalent vinylic protons (CH=CH) in a symmetrical molecule. The shift is in the alkene/aromatic region.\n        *   Two ¹³C NMR peaks suggest only two types of carbons. A symmetrical structure would have two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and two equivalent vinylic carbons (C=CH). The chemical shifts of 137 ppm (vinylic C) and 165 ppm (anhydride carbonyl C) are highly characteristic.\n        *   The only molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**, formed from the dehydration of *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid).\n        *   The molecular formula for maleic anhydride is **C₄H₂O₃**.\n\n    *   **The Diene**: The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1,3 and methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. The 5th position is a CH₂ group.\n        *   Let's determine its molecular formula. Cyclopentadiene is C₅H₆. We replace the four vinylic hydrogens on C1, C2, C3, and C4 with four methyl groups.\n        *   Formula = C₅H₂(CH₃)₄ = C₅H₂ + C₄H₁₂ = **C₉H₁₄**.\n\n2.  **Verify the Product's Molecular Formula.**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition, a [4+2] reaction. The formula of the product is the sum of the formulas of the reactants.\n    *   Product Formula = C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**.\n    *   This matches the molecular formula given in the problem, confirming our identification of the reactants.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products.**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride will form a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   The reaction yields two products, a major and a minor one. These correspond to the *endo* and *exo* stereoisomers.\n    *   According to the **Alder endo rule**, for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* adduct is the major product. The *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n        *   **Endo adduct (Major Product)**: The bulky part of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is oriented *syn* (on the same side as) the C7-CH₂ bridge. This places the two hydrogens on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) in an *exo* position relative to the bicyclic system.\n        *   **Exo adduct (Minor Product)**: The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side of) the C7-CH₂ bridge. This places the H_anhydride protons in an *endo* position.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Expected NMR Signals.**\n    *   Due to a plane of symmetry in both the *endo* and *exo* products, we expect the following signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n        *   **A 2H singlet for the anhydride protons (H_anhydride)**. These are methine protons (CH) alpha to two carbonyl groups, so they will be significantly deshielded. The value of **~3.5 ppm** is a reasonable estimate.\n        *   **Two 6H singlets for the methyl groups**. There are two bridgehead methyls (on sp³ carbons) and two vinylic methyls (on sp² carbons of the double bond). They are inequivalent. Vinylic methyls are typically downfield from alkyl methyls.\n            *   Vinylic methyls (**Me_vinyl**): **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**.\n            *   Bridgehead methyls (**Me_bridgehead**): **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet)**.\n        *   **Two 1H signals for the C7 bridge protons**. These two protons (H_syn and H_anti) are diastereotopic and will couple to each other, likely forming a pair of doublets (an AB system). A chemical shift of **~1.5 ppm** for one of them is reasonable.\n\n5.  **Use NOESY to Differentiate Isomers.**\n    *   A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two sets of protons are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. We need to find a proton-proton distance that is short in the *endo* adduct but long in the *exo* adduct.\n    *   Let's analyze the spatial relationships for each option based on the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) structures. The key is the position of the H_anhydride protons.\n        *   **Major (*endo*) product**: H_anhydride are in the *exo* position (pointing \"outward\" and away from the C7 bridge).\n        *   **Minor (*exo*) product**: H_anhydride are in the *endo* position (pointing \"inward\" into the molecular cage, toward the C7 bridge).\n\n    *   **Evaluation of the Options:**\n        *   **A) Me_bridgehead (~1.0 ppm) and Me_vinyl (~1.7 ppm):** The distance between these groups is fixed by the rigid bicyclic skeleton and should be very similar in both *endo* and *exo* isomers. This cannot be the distinguishing cross-peak.\n        *   **B) Me_bridgehead (~1.0 ppm) and H_bridge (~1.5 ppm):** The bridgehead methyls are adjacent to the C7 bridge. Their distance to the C7 protons is short and similar in both isomers. Not a distinguishing feature.\n        *   **C) Me_vinyl (~1.7 ppm) and H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm):**\n            *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the H_anhydride protons are in the *exo* position. This points them towards the C5=C6 double bond bridge where the Me_vinyl groups are located. They are relatively close in space. **A NOESY cross-peak is expected.**\n            *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the H_anhydride protons are in the *endo* position, pointing into the cage and away from the Me_vinyl groups. They are far apart. **A NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak.**\n            *   This scenario perfectly matches the experimental observation given in the question.\n        *   **D) H_bridge (~1.5 ppm) and H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm):**\n            *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, H_anhydride are *exo* and thus far from the C7 bridge protons. **No NOE expected.**\n            *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, H_anhydride are *endo* and point directly at the C7 bridge. They are very close to the *syn*-C7 proton. **Strong NOE expected.**\n            *   This is the opposite of the experimental observation.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    The cross-peak that is present in the major product (endo) and absent in the minor product (exo) is between the vinylic methyl protons (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet) and the anhydride methine protons (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet).\n\n<<<C>>>"
