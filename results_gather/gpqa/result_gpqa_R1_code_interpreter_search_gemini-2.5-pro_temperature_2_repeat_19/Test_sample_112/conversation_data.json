    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, the C=O group in a carboxylic acid absorbs around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This is the characteristic region for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It represents the loss of the carboxyl group radical cation, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass of C = 12\n    *   Mass of O = 16\n    *   Mass of H = 1\n    *   Total mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   The combined evidence from all three techniques strongly indicates that the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid** (a molecule containing both an alkene and a carboxylic acid).\n*   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n*   We are left with two possibilities: **A) C6H12O2** and **C) C6H10O2**.\n\n**5. Using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nTo distinguish between the two remaining formulas, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n\n*   The DoU for a molecule with the formula CxHyOz can be calculated as: **DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)**\n*   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain:\n    1.  A C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid). This counts as 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    2.  A C=C double bond (from the alkene). This counts as another 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   Therefore, the molecule must have a total DoU of at least 2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) C6H12O2:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n*   **C) C6H10O2:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n\nThe formula C6H12O2 has only one degree of unsaturation, which is not enough to account for both a carbonyl group and an alkene. The formula C6H10O2 has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly matches our findings of one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe molecular formula of the unknown compound must be C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
