    "This problem requires us to calculate the partition function (Z) for a system of three spins (S1, S2, S3), each of which can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. The partition function is defined as Z = Σ_states e^(-βE), where the sum is over all possible microstates of the system and β = 1/(kT).\n\n**Step 1: Identify all possible microstates.**\nThe system consists of three spins, and each spin can take two values (+1 or -1). Therefore, the total number of microstates is 2^3 = 8. We can list all of them:\n1.  (+1, +1, +1)\n2.  (+1, +1, -1)\n3.  (+1, -1, +1)\n4.  (-1, +1, +1)\n5.  (+1, -1, -1)\n6.  (-1, +1, -1)\n7.  (-1, -1, +1)\n8.  (-1, -1, -1)\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the energy for each microstate.**\nThe energy is given by E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. We will calculate the term S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state.\n\n*   **State (+1, +1, +1):**\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n    Energy E = -J(3) = -3J.\n\n*   **States with two +1 spins and one -1 spin:**\n    -   State (+1, +1, -1): S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    -   State (+1, -1, +1): S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    -   State (-1, +1, +1): S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    There are 3 such states, all with energy E = J.\n\n*   **States with one +1 spin and two -1 spins:**\n    -   State (+1, -1, -1): S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    -   State (-1, +1, -1): S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    -   State (-1, -1, +1): S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    There are 3 such states, all with energy E = J.\n\n*   **State (-1, -1, -1):**\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n    Energy E = -J(3) = -3J.\n\n**Step 3: Group the states by energy level and find their degeneracies.**\nFrom our calculations, we have two distinct energy levels:\n\n1.  **Energy E1 = -3J:**\n    This energy level corresponds to the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    The degeneracy (number of states) is g1 = 2.\n\n2.  **Energy E2 = J:**\n    This energy level corresponds to the six remaining states: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n    The degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Partition Function Z.**\nThe partition function is the sum over all energy levels of the degeneracy of the level multiplied by the Boltzmann factor for that level: Z = Σ_i g_i * e^(-βE_i).\n\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis result matches option D."
