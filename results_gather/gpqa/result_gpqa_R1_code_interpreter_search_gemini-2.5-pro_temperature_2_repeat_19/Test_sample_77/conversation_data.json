    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### 1. Identify the Physical Scenario\nThe problem describes a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`. We want to find the electromagnetic potentials, scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A`, at a specific point in space `r` and time `t`. This is the classic problem solved by the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n### 2. Key Concepts: Retardation\nElectromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, `c`. This means the field experienced at a point `r` at time `t` was not generated by the charge at its current position and time. Instead, it was generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the **retarded time** (`tr`), from a previous position `s(tr)`.\n\nThe time delay is the time it took for the field to travel from the charge's retarded position to the observation point. Let `d` be the vector from the retarded position `s(tr)` to the observation point `r`:\n  \n  $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$\n  \nThe magnitude of this vector is `d = |\\vec{d}|`.\n\nThe relationship between the observation time `t` and the retarded time `tr` is:\n\n  $t = t_r + \\dfrac{d}{c}$\n\nThis equation implicitly defines `tr` for a given `r` and `t`, because `d` itself depends on `tr`.\n\n### 3. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\nThe general solutions for the potentials from a time-varying charge distribution are given by the retarded potentials. For a single point charge `q` moving with velocity `v = ds/dt`, these integrals simplify to the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe standard textbook expressions for the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` are:\n\n  $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n  $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nHere, the notation `[ ... ]_tr` means that all quantities inside the brackets (`d`, `v`) must be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 4. Algebraic Manipulation\nNow, let's manipulate the denominator of these expressions to match the form given in the options. The denominator is:\n\n  $d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nLet's find a common denominator `c`:\n\n  $d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for `V` and `A`.\n\n**For the scalar potential V:**\n\n  $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{\\left( \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} \\right)} = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n**For the vector potential A:**\n\n  $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\left( \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} \\right)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n### 5. Compare with Options\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given choices:\n\n*   A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - Incorrect, the sign in the denominator is wrong.\n*   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - Incorrect. `V` is the static potential, not the retarded one. The relation for `A` is also wrong.\n*   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - Incorrect. `V` is the static potential. While the relation $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$ is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for `V` itself is wrong.\n*   D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - This perfectly matches our derived expressions.\n\nNote: The question uses `μ` while the option uses `μo`. Since the medium is free space (indicated by `εo` and `c`), `μ` should be interpreted as `μo`, the permeability of free space.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions are those given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
