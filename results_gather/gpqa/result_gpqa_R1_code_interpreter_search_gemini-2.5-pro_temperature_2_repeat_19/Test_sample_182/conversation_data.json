    "Here is a step-by-step thinking process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Reactant Molecule**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down this IUPAC name to understand its structure and molecular formula.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** \"cyclohex-3-ene\" indicates a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between the 3rd and 4th carbon atoms.\n*   **Principal Functional Group:** \"carboxylic acid\" (-COOH) is the highest priority group, so it is located at carbon C1.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   \"2-formyl\": A formyl group (-CHO) is attached to C2.\n    *   \"5-vinyl\": A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is attached to C5.\n\nFrom this structure, let's determine the molecular formula of the reactant.\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH₂ = **10 carbons**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = **3 oxygens**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** Instead of manually counting hydrogens, which can be prone to error, we can use the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant to find the hydrogen count. A saturated, non-cyclic alkane with 10 carbons would have the formula C₁₀H₂₂. Let's calculate the IHD from the known unsaturations in the reactant structure:\n    *   1 for the ring structure.\n    *   1 for the double bond in the ring (-3-ene).\n    *   1 for the carbonyl double bond (C=O) in the carboxylic acid.\n    *   1 for the carbonyl double bond (C=O) in the formyl group.\n    *   1 for the double bond in the vinyl group.\n    *   **Total IHD of Reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5**.\n*   Each degree of unsaturation removes two hydrogen atoms from the saturated formula. So, the number of hydrogens is 22 - (2 * 5) = 12.\n*   Thus, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n### **2. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI** (hydroiodic acid).\n\n*   This is a very powerful reducing agent combination in organic chemistry.\n*   Its primary function is to completely reduce oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturation (double and triple bonds) to the corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n*   Specifically:\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   Aldehyde/Formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C) by the addition of hydrogen.\n    *   All oxygen atoms are removed from the molecule.\n\n### **3. Determine the Product's Structure and Formula**\n\n*   The reaction does not add or remove any carbon atoms, so the product will also have **10 carbon atoms**.\n*   The reaction converts the reactant into a fully saturated hydrocarbon, while preserving the ring structure.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring. The substituents are converted to saturated alkyl groups.\n*   The product is a substituted cyclohexane. Any molecule with a single ring and no multiple bonds is a **cycloalkane**.\n*   The general molecular formula for a cycloalkane is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   Since our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) quantifies the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the Molecular Formula (C₁₀H₂₀)**\n    The IHD for a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ is calculated as:\n    IHD = x - (y/2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the Structure**\n    The product is a substituted cyclohexane. By definition, its structure contains:\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of pi bonds (double or triple bonds) = 0\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n    IHD = 1 + 0\n    IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 5 (This is the IHD of the reactant)\nC) 3\nD) 0 (This would be an acyclic, saturated alkane)\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
