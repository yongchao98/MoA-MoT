    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. Assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms across different energy levels is governed by the **Boltzmann distribution**.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (let's call it level 2) to the number of atoms in a lower state (level 1) is given by:\n    $N_2 / N_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-(E_2 - E_1) / (k * T))$\n    where:\n    *   $N_2$ and $N_1$ are the number of atoms in the respective energy levels.\n    *   $g_2$ and $g_1$ are the statistical weights of the levels (a property of the atom).\n    *   $E_2 - E_1 = \\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to the two stars:** The problem states that the \"excitation\" in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This refers to the ratio of atoms in the excited state to a lower state. Let's denote this excitation ratio as $R = N_{excited} / N_{lower}$.\n    *   For star_1 (temperature $T_1$):\n        $R_1 = (g_{excited} / g_{lower}) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1))$\n    *   For star_2 (temperature $T_2$):\n        $R_2 = (g_{excited} / g_{lower}) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))$\n\n    The statistical weights ($g$) and the energy difference ($\\Delta E$) are properties of the iron atom and the specific energy levels, so they are the same for both stars.\n\n4.  **Use the given relationship between the excitations:** The problem states that star_1 is twice as excited as star_2, so:\n    $R_1 = 2 * R_2$\n\n    Substitute the expressions from step 3:\n    $(g_{excited} / g_{lower}) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [(g_{excited} / g_{lower}) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))]$\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation:** The term with the statistical weights $(g_{excited} / g_{lower})$ appears on both sides and can be canceled out:\n    $exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))$\n\n6.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To deal with the exponents, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n    $ln[exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))]$\n    Using the logarithm properties ($ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)$ and $ln(e^x) = x$):\n    $-\\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + [-\\Delta E / (k * T_2)]$\n    $-\\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - \\Delta E / (k * T_2)$\n\n    Now, rearrange the equation to isolate $ln(2)$:\n    $ln(2) = \\Delta E / (k * T_2) - \\Delta E / (k * T_1)$\n\n    Factor out the common term $\\Delta E / k$:\n    $ln(2) = (\\Delta E / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)$\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parentheses:\n    $ln(2) = (\\Delta E / k) * ( (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) )$\n\n7.  **Use the given numerical values:** The problem provides the energy difference $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J$. The Boltzmann constant, $k$, is a fundamental physical constant with the value $k \\approx 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} J/K$.\n\n    Let's calculate the value of the factor $(\\Delta E / k)$:\n    $(\\Delta E / k) \\approx (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J) / (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} J/K) \\approx 1 K$\n\n    The fact that the given energy value is numerically almost identical to the Boltzmann constant is a strong hint that we should approximate this ratio as 1.\n\n8.  **Finalize the equation:** Substitute $(\\Delta E / k) = 1$ back into the derived equation:\n    $ln(2) = (1) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]$\n    $ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1*T_2) ]$\n\n9.  **Compare with the options:** This result matches option A exactly.\n\n    *   A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]  -> **Correct**\n    *   B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ] -> Incorrect, denominator is squared.\n    *   C) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1] -> Incorrect, form does not match.\n    *   D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)] -> Incorrect, numerator should be a difference.\n\n<<<A>>>"
