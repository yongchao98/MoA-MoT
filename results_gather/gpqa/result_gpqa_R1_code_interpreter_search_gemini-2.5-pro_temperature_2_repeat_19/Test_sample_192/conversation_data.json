    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   We are given an observational relationship in a specific region of the sky: \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\".\n    *   We are asked to find how the number of stars changes with distance `r`, specifically \"per unit range of distance\". This quantity is the differential number count with respect to distance, `dN/dr`.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Given Relationship:**\n    *   The phrase \"the number of stars varies with parallax (`plx`)\" can be interpreted in two ways:\n        a) As a **cumulative count**: The total number of stars with parallax *greater than* a certain value `plx`. Let's denote this as `N(>plx)`. This is a common convention in astronomy (e.g., number of stars brighter than magnitude `m`). A larger parallax corresponds to a closer star, so this represents the total number of stars within a certain distance.\n        b) As a **differential count**: The number density of stars per unit of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`.\n\n    *   Interpretation (a) is the more standard way astronomical number counts are expressed. If a differential count were intended, the language would typically be more specific (e.g., \"number density per unit parallax\"). Therefore, we will proceed with the cumulative count interpretation.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mathematical Relationships:**\n    *   **Given relationship:** Based on our interpretation, `N(>plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`. We can write this as `N(>plx) = C * plx^(-5)` where `C` is a constant of proportionality.\n    *   **Parallax-Distance Relationship:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`r`). The standard definition is `plx = 1/r` (when `plx` is in arcseconds and `r` is in parsecs).\n    *   **Quantity to find:** We need to determine the proportionality for `dN/dr`.\n\n4.  **Connect the Given Information to the Desired Quantity:**\n    *   The cumulative number of stars with parallax greater than `plx`, `N(>plx)`, is equivalent to the cumulative number of stars *within* a distance `r`, where `r = 1/plx`. Let's call this `N(<r)`.\n    *   So, `N(<r) = N(>1/r)`.\n\n5.  **Derive the Relationship for N(<r) as a function of r:**\n    *   We substitute `plx = 1/r` into our given relationship:\n        `N(<r) = C * (1/r)^(-5) = C * r^5`.\n    *   This tells us that the total number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Number of Stars per Unit Distance (dN/dr):**\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars \"per unit range of distance,\" which is the derivative of the cumulative number `N(<r)` with respect to `r`.\n    *   We differentiate the expression for `N(<r)`:\n        `dN/dr = d/dr (C * r^5)`\n        `dN/dr = 5 * C * r^(5-1)`\n        `dN/dr = 5 * C * r^4`\n    *   This shows that `dN/dr` is directly proportional to `r^4`.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars in that region of the sky, per unit range of distance, changes as `r^4`.\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        A) ~ r^4\n        B) ~ r^5\n        C) ~ r^3\n        D) ~ r^2\n    *   The result matches option A.\n\n(Self-Correction/Verification: If we had used the alternative, less likely interpretation `dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx^5`, the chain rule `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)` would give `dN/dr ~ (r^5) * (1/r^2) = r^3`. However, the cumulative count is the standard interpretation for this type of problem statement.)\n\n<<<A>>>"
