    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Concepts**\n\n*   **State Vector (`|ψ>`):** Represents the state of the quantum system. It must be normalized for probability calculations, meaning its norm (length) must be 1.\n*   **Observables (P, Q):** Physical quantities that can be measured, represented by Hermitian matrices.\n*   **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:** The possible outcomes of a measurement of an observable are its eigenvalues. When a measurement is made, the system's state vector \"collapses\" into the eigenvector corresponding to the measured eigenvalue.\n*   **Probability of Measurement:** If the system is in a normalized state `|ψ>` and we measure an observable, the probability of obtaining a specific eigenvalue `λ` is `|<v|ψ>|^2`, where `|v>` is the normalized eigenvector corresponding to `λ`. The term `<v|ψ>` represents the inner product (or dot product for column vectors) of the eigenvector and the state vector.\n*   **Sequential Measurements:** When measurements are made one after another, the state first collapses due to the first measurement. The second measurement is then performed on this new, collapsed state. The total probability of a sequence of outcomes is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: Normalize the Initial State Vector**\n\nThe initial state is given by `|ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T`.\nFirst, we calculate the norm squared of this vector:\n`||ψ||^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe norm is `||ψ|| = sqrt(6)`.\nThe normalized state vector, `|ψ_norm>`, is the original vector divided by its norm:\n`|ψ_norm> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n\n**Step B: Analyze the First Measurement (Operator P)**\n\nWe need to find the probability of measuring the value `0` for the observable P. This requires finding the eigenvector of P that corresponds to the eigenvalue `p = 0`.\n\nThe matrix for P is:\n`P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\nWe solve the eigenvector equation `P|v> = p|v>` for `p=0`, so `P|v> = 0`.\nLet `|v> = [x, y, z]^T`.\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\nThis gives us a system of equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n\nSo, any eigenvector for `p=0` is of the form `[c, 0, -c]^T` for some constant `c`. To make it a normalized eigenvector `|v_p0>`, its length must be 1:\n`c^2 + 0^2 + (-c)^2 = 1`\n`2c^2 = 1`\n`c = 1/√2`\nSo, the normalized eigenvector for `p=0` is `|v_p0> = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T`.\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Probability of the First Measurement**\n\nThe probability of measuring `p=0` is `Prob(p=0) = |<v_p0|ψ_norm>|^2`.\nFirst, calculate the inner product `<v_p0|ψ_norm>`:\n`<v_p0|ψ_norm> = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] * (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n`= (1/sqrt(12)) * ( (1)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1)*(1) )`\n`= (1/sqrt(12)) * (-1 - 1)`\n`= -2 / sqrt(12) = -2 / (2*sqrt(3)) = -1/√3`\n\nNow, square the magnitude to get the probability:\n`Prob(p=0) = |-1/√3|^2 = 1/3`\n\n**Step D: State Collapse**\n\nAfter measuring `p=0`, the system's state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector `|v_p0>`. So the new state of the system is:\n`|ψ_new> = |v_p0> = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T`\n\n**Step E: Analyze the Second Measurement (Operator Q)**\n\nNow we measure the observable Q on the new state `|ψ_new>`. We want the probability of getting the outcome `q = -1`. We need the eigenvector of Q for `q=-1`.\n\nThe matrix for Q is:\n`Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\nSince Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries (`1, 0, -1`) and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `q=-1` is `|v_q-1> = [0, 0, 1]^T`. It is already normalized.\n\n**Step F: Calculate the Probability of the Second Measurement**\n\nThe probability of measuring `q=-1` from the state `|ψ_new>` is `Prob(q=-1) = |<v_q-1|ψ_new>|^2`.\nFirst, the inner product:\n`<v_q-1|ψ_new> = [0, 0, 1] * [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T`\n`= (0)*(1/√2) + (0)*(0) + (1)*(-1/√2)`\n`= -1/√2`\n\nNow, the probability:\n`Prob(q=-1 from |ψ_new>) = |-1/√2|^2 = 1/2`\n\n**Step G: Calculate the Total Probability**\n\nThe total probability of measuring `p=0` and *then* measuring `q=-1` is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the sequence:\n`Total Probability = Prob(p=0) * Prob(q=-1 from |ψ_new>)`\n`Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
