    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Model and the Initial State\n\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule (X-Y) using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy levels of such a molecule are given by the formula:\n\nE(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J + 1)\n\nwhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, which depends on the molecule's moment of inertia.\n\nThe molecule is initially in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers, so `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\nInitial Energy: E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω.\n\n### 2. Determine the Final State and Transition Energy\n\nThe molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" We must consider the selection rules for photon absorption in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule (like X-Y).\nThe selection rules for the most common type of vibrational excitation (infrared absorption) are:\n\n*   **Δv = +1** (The vibrational quantum number must increase by 1)\n*   **ΔJ = ±1** (The rotational quantum number must change by 1)\n\nStarting from the initial state (v=0, J=0):\n*   `v` must change from 0 to 1 (Δv = +1).\n*   `J` must change by ±1. Since J cannot be negative, it must change from 0 to 1 (ΔJ = +1).\n\nTherefore, the final state is (v=1, J=1).\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (ΔE) must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states:\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0)\nΔE = [ (1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(1+1) ] - [ (1/2)ħω + B(0)(0+1) ]\nΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ]\nΔE = ħω + 2B\n\n### 3. Calculate the Physical Constants for the Molecule (B)\n\nTo find ΔE, we need to calculate the rotational constant `B`. `B` is defined as:\n\nB = ħ² / (2I)\n\nwhere `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule. For a diatomic molecule, `I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass and `R` is the bond length.\n\n**a. Calculate the Reduced Mass (μ):**\nμ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\nWe must first convert the masses from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg). (1 amu ≈ 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg).\n\n*   Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n*   My = 2 amu = 2 * 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n*   μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n*   μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg ≈ 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n**b. Calculate the Moment of Inertia (I):**\nThe bond length `R` must be in meters (2 Å = 2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m).\n\n*   I = μR² = (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n*   I ≈ 1.2077 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n**c. Calculate the Rotational Constant (B):**\n*   B = ħ² / (2I) = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2077 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\n*   B ≈ 4.604 × 10⁻²³ J\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nNow we can calculate the total energy of the photon:\n\nΔE = ħω + 2B\n*   ħω = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   2B = 2 * (4.604 × 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 9.208 × 10⁻²³ J\n*   ΔE = (4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.208 × 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 4.227 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n\nNote that the rotational energy (2B) is a very small correction to the vibrational energy (ħω).\n\n### 5. Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p)\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum `p` by the equation E = pc, where `c` is the speed of light (≈ 3.0 × 10⁸ m/s).\n\np = ΔE / c\np = (4.227 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.9979 × 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.41 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis value is very close to option D. The calculation can be performed precisely using a script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the constants\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\nc = 2.99792458e8         # Speed of light in m/s\namu_to_kg = 1.66053906660e-27 # Conversion factor for amu to kg\n\n# Input data from the problem\nMx_amu = 20.0  # Mass of atom X in amu\nMy_amu = 2.0   # Mass of atom Y in amu\nR_angstrom = 2.0 # Bond length in Angstroms\nw = 4.0e14     # Angular frequency in rad/s\n\n# Convert inputs to SI units\nMx_kg = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\nMy_kg = My_amu * amu_to_kg\nR_m = R_angstrom * 1e-10\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the reduced mass (mu)\nmu = (Mx_kg * My_kg) / (Mx_kg + My_kg)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu * R_m**2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the rotational constant (B)\nB = h_bar**2 / (2 * I)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total energy of the absorbed photon for the transition (v=0, J=0) -> (v=1, J=1)\n# The energy difference is delta_E = h_bar*w + 2*B\ndelta_E = h_bar * w + 2 * B\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the momentum of the photon\np = delta_E / c\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"The momentum of the absorbed photon is: {p:.2e} N*s\")\n```\n\nThe computed momentum `p` is 1.41 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) p = 1.9 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\nB) p = 1.1 × 10⁻²⁷ N·s\nC) p = 2.3 × 10⁻²⁷ N·s\nD) p = 1.4 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Model:** The problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor) for a diatomic molecule. The energy levels in this model are given by the sum of vibrational and rotational energies:\n    E(v, J) = E_vibrational + E_rotational = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J + 1)\n    where:\n    *   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)\n    *   `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration\n    *   `B` is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2I), where `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\n2.  **Determine Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which means it has the lowest possible energy. This occurs at the lowest possible quantum numbers, `v=0` and `J=0`.\n        E_initial = E(0, 0) = (0 + 1/2)ħω + B(0)(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω.\n    *   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" For photon absorption in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the rovibrational selection rules are:\n        Δv = +1\n        ΔJ = ±1\n    *   Applying the selection rules to the initial state (v=0, J=0):\n        *   v must go from 0 to 1 (Δv = +1).\n        *   J must go from 0 to 1 (ΔJ = +1), because J cannot become negative (J=0 -> J=-1 is not allowed).\n    *   Therefore, the final state is `v=1`, `J=1`.\n        E_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon (ΔE):**\n    The energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    ΔE = E_final - E_initial\n    ΔE = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω]\n    ΔE = ħω + 2B\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Physical Constants:**\n    To find ΔE, we need to calculate the rotational constant `B`, which requires calculating the moment of inertia `I`, which in turn requires the reduced mass `μ`. All units must be in SI.\n    *   **Given Data:**\n        *   Mx = 20 amu\n        *   My = 2 amu\n        *   R = 2 Å = 2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n        *   ω = 4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s\n    *   **Constants:**\n        *   amu to kg conversion: 1 amu ≈ 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n    *   **a) Calculate Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n        μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n        μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n    *   **b) Calculate Moment of Inertia (I):**\n        I = μ * R²\n        I ≈ (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n        I ≈ 1.2077 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n    *   **c) Calculate Rotational Constant (B):**\n        B = ħ² / (2I)\n        B = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2077 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\n        B ≈ 4.604 × 10⁻²³ J\n\n5.  **Calculate the Photon Energy (ΔE) Numerically:**\n    ΔE = ħω + 2B\n    ΔE = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)(4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s) + 2(4.604 × 10⁻²³ J)\n    ΔE ≈ (4.2183 × 10⁻²⁰ J) + (0.00092 × 10⁻²⁰ J)\n    ΔE ≈ 4.2275 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n    *(Note: The rotational energy term is about 0.2% of the vibrational energy term, a small but non-negligible correction).*\n\n6.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p):**\n    The relationship between a photon's energy (E) and momentum (p) is E = pc, where `c` is the speed of light (≈ 2.9979 × 10⁸ m/s).\n    p = ΔE / c\n    p = (4.2275 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.9979 × 10⁸ m/s)\n    p ≈ 1.410 × 10⁻²⁸ J·s/m or N·s\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated momentum is p ≈ 1.41 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) p = 1.9 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n    B) p = 1.1 × 10⁻²⁷ N·s\n    C) p = 2.3 × 10⁻²⁷ N·s\n    D) p = 1.4 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n    The calculated value matches option D.
