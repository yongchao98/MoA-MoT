    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the Starting Material**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO using the provided ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    A DoU of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond or ring (e.g., a carbonyl group C=O).\n\n*   **Analyze the ¹H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** A signal in the 9-10 ppm range is a classic indicator of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**. The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons in this region, coupled with the presence of nitrogen in the formula, is typical for a primary **amine group (-NH2)**.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A signal for 2 protons, appearing as a doublet (d), means it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This is consistent with a **-CH2- group** coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   We have the fragments: a para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4), an amine group (-NH2), a methylene group (-CH2-), and an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n    *   Let's combine them: C6H4 + NH2 + CH2 + CHO = C8H9NO. This perfectly matches the molecular formula.\n    *   The coupling confirms the `-CH2-CHO` unit (aldehyde proton is a triplet, methylene protons are a doublet).\n    *   The two substituents on the benzene ring must be -NH2 and -CH2-CHO, in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n    *   Therefore, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Part 2: Analyzing the Reaction Sequence**\n\nNow, we will trace the starting material through the given series of reactions.\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    *   This is the standard set of reagents for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   **Intermediate Product 1:** 4-(diazonium)phenylacetaldehyde chloride.\n        Structure: [Cl-][N2+]-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    *   Adding water and warming the diazonium salt solution causes hydrolysis. The -N2+ group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from the water.\n    *   **Intermediate Product 2:** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        Structure: HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    *   The conditions are a strong base (KOH), an aldehyde with α-protons (the CH2 group in 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is alpha to the carbonyl), and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**. This is a self-condensation reaction since only one type of aldehyde is present.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        3.  **Protonation:** An acid-base reaction with water yields the **aldol adduct**.\n            The structure of the aldol adduct is: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. (This corresponds to option A).\n            Chain numbering: (HO-C6H4)-CH2(4)-CH(OH)(3)-CH(C6H4-OH)(2)-CHO(1)\n        4.  **Dehydration:** The keyword \"Heat\" indicates that the reaction does not stop at the aldol adduct. The adduct undergoes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The base removes the proton from the α-carbon (C2) and the -OH group leaves from the β-carbon (C3), forming a double bond between them.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        Structure: (HO-C6H4)-CH2(4)-CH(3)=C(C6H4-OH)(2)-CHO(1)\n        Name: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Part 3: Matching with Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal:** This is the aldol adduct, which is an intermediate. It is not the final product because the reaction is heated.\n*   **B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal:** Incorrect substituents (phenyl instead of hydroxyphenyl) and incorrect double bond position.\n*   **C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This perfectly matches the structure derived for the final condensation product.\n*   **D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal:** Incorrect structure and stoichiometry. This is not a product of self-condensation.\n\nThe final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
