    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Principle of Dimensional Analysis in Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**\n\nIn natural units, where the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ and the speed of light $c$ are set to 1 ($\\hbar = c = 1$), all physical quantities can be expressed in units of mass to some power. This is called the **mass dimension**.\n\n*   Mass, Energy, Momentum: `[M]`¹\n*   Length, Time: `[M]`⁻¹\n\nA key principle in QFT is that the **action**, S, must be dimensionless. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density, $\\mathcal{L}$, over spacetime:\n\n$S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$\n\nSince the spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of `[length]`⁴ = `[M]`⁻⁴, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of `[M]`⁴ to make the action S dimensionless.\n\n$[\\mathcal{L}] = [M]^4$\n\nEvery term added to the Lagrangian density must have this same mass dimension.\n\n### **2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields and Operators**\n\nWe need to find the mass dimensions of each component in the given interaction Lagrangian, $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$. We can deduce these from the standard kinetic terms for the fields.\n\n*   **Fermion Field ($\\psi$):**\n    The kinetic term for a fermion field (like an electron) is $\\mathcal{L}_{Dirac} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. Let's analyze the term $\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi$.\n    *   The partial derivative $\\partial_\\mu$ has the dimension of inverse length, so $[\\partial_\\mu] = [M]^1$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless.\n    *   The dimension of the term must be `[M]`⁴: $[\\bar{\\psi}][\\psi][\\partial_\\mu] = [M]^4$.\n    *   Since $[\\bar{\\psi}] = [\\psi]$, we have $[\\psi]^2 [M]^1 = [M]^4$.\n    *   This implies $[\\psi]^2 = [M]^3$, so the mass dimension of the fermion field is $[\\psi] = [M]^{3/2}$.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic Field Strength Tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$):**\n    The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field (a gauge field) is $\\mathcal{L}_{Maxwell} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   The dimension of this term must be `[M]`⁴: $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [F^{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = [M]^4$.\n    *   This implies the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [M]^2$.\n\n*   **The operator $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$:**\n    This operator is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]$. Since the gamma matrices ($\\gamma_\\mu$) are dimensionless constant matrices, their commutator is also dimensionless.\n    *   $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = [M]^0$.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Mass Dimension of $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we can analyze the interaction term itself:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$\n\nThe mass dimension of this term must be `[M]`⁴.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] [\\bar{\\psi}] [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] [\\psi] [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [M]^4$\n\nLet's substitute the dimensions we found for the fields and operators:\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^{3/2} \\cdot [M]^0 \\cdot [M]^{3/2} \\cdot [M]^2 = [M]^4$\n\nCombining the dimensions on the left side:\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^{(3/2 + 3/2 + 2)} = [M]^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^{(3 + 2)} = [M]^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^5 = [M]^4$\n\nSolving for $[\\kappa]$:\n$[\\kappa] = \\frac{[M]^4}{[M]^5} = [M]^{-1}$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n### **4. Renormalizability**\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined from the mass dimension of its coupling constants. A theory is:\n\n*   **Super-renormalizable** if the mass dimension of its coupling constant is positive (`[g] > 0`). These interactions become less significant at high energies.\n*   **Renormalizable** if the mass dimension of its coupling constant is zero (`[g] = 0`). The strength of these interactions does not change with energy at the classical level. QED is a prime example.\n*   **Non-renormalizable** if the mass dimension of its coupling constant is negative (`[g] < 0`). These interactions become increasingly strong at high energies, leading to divergences in perturbative calculations that cannot be absorbed into a finite number of parameters. Such theories are typically treated as effective field theories, valid only up to a certain energy scale.\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of **-1**. Since this is negative, the theory is **non-renormalizable**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is **-1**.\n*   The theory is **not renormalizable**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
