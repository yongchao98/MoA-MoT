    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Scenario:** A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at a high voltage (1000 kV) under ultra-high vacuum (< 10⁻⁹ Torr).\n    *   **λ1 (Lambda 1):** The mean free path of the *remaining gas molecules colliding with each other*. This is the standard gas kinetic definition of the mean free path. This happens *before* the electron beam is active.\n    *   **λ2 (Lambda 2):** The mean free path related to the *electron beam scattering off the gas molecules*. This is the average distance an electron travels before it interacts with a gas molecule. This is observed *after* the electron beam is turned on.\n    *   **Constant Condition:** The temperature and, by extension, the number density (`n`) of the gas molecules in the chamber remain the same.\n    *   **Question:** What is the relationship between λ2 and λ1?\n\n2.  **Analyze the Physics of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    *   The general formula for mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n        *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision/scattering cross-section, which is the effective area that a target particle presents to an incoming particle for a \"collision\" to occur.\n\n3.  **Calculate/Define λ1:**\n    *   This is the MFP for a gas molecule moving through other gas molecules.\n    *   The incoming particles are gas molecules, and the target particles are also gas molecules. Since both are moving, we must account for their relative velocities. This introduces a factor of √2 into the denominator.\n    *   So, the formula is: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   Here, `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. This is basically a \"hard sphere\" collision, determined by the physical size (kinetic diameter, `d`) of the molecules. We can approximate σ_gg ≈ πd².\n\n4.  **Calculate/Define λ2:**\n    *   This is the MFP for a high-energy electron moving through the gas molecules.\n    *   The incoming particles are electrons, and the target particles are the gas molecules.\n    *   The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they are traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light. The gas molecules, at room temperature, are moving extremely slowly in comparison. Therefore, we can consider the gas molecules to be stationary targets. The √2 factor is not needed.\n    *   So, the formula is: **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   Here, `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare the Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   This is the crucial step. The relationship between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on the relationship between their respective denominators, specifically `√2 * σ_gg` versus `σ_eg`.\n    *   **Molecule-Molecule Interaction (for σ_gg):** Neutral gas molecules interact via very short-range forces (van der Waals forces). The collision is like two billiard balls hitting. The cross-section `σ_gg` is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n    *   **Electron-Molecule Interaction (for σ_eg):** An electron is a charged particle. It interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electrostatic (Coulomb) force. The electron is repelled by the molecule's electron cloud and attracted by its atomic nuclei. Because this force has a much longer range than the van der Waals force, an electron can be significantly deflected (i.e., \"scattered\") even when it passes quite far from the molecule's physical boundary.\n    *   **Conclusion on Cross-Sections:** The effective target area that a molecule presents to an incoming electron (`σ_eg`) is much larger than the physical cross-section it presents to another molecule (`σ_gg`). Therefore, **σ_eg > σ_gg**. It is also much larger than `√2 * σ_gg` (since √2 is only ~1.414).\n\n6.  **Final Comparison of λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   We have:\n        *   λ1 = 1 / (n * √2 * σ_gg)\n        *   λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   We established that the denominator for λ2 is larger than the denominator for λ1, because σ_eg > √2 * σ_gg.\n    *   Since the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to its denominator, a larger denominator results in a smaller mean free path.\n    *   Therefore, we must conclude that **λ2 < λ1**.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1: Incorrect. This suggests λ2 is larger than λ1. The number 1.22 is likely a distractor related to the Rayleigh criterion for optical resolution, which is not relevant here.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: This matches our physical reasoning. The mean free path for an electron scattering in a gas is shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules scattering amongst themselves because the electron-gas interaction cross-section is much larger.\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. The two physical processes (molecule-molecule collision vs. electron-molecule scattering) are fundamentally different, so there is no reason to expect their mean free paths to be equal.\n    *   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This suggests λ2 is larger than λ1.\n\nThe correct conclusion is that the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) is shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n\n<<<B>>>"
