    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n**1. Express the potential in Cartesian coordinates.**\n\nThe given potential is in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$:\n$V(r, θ) = \\frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \\frac{3}{2} kr^2 \\cos^2(θ)$\n\nTo solve the problem, it is convenient to switch to Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$. The transformation rules are:\n$x = r \\cos(θ)$\n$y = r \\sin(θ)$\n$r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\nSubstitute these into the potential expression:\nThe first term is $\\frac{1}{2} kr^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k(x^2 + y^2)$.\nThe second term is $\\frac{3}{2} kr^2 \\cos^2(θ) = \\frac{3}{2} k (r \\cos(θ))^2 = \\frac{3}{2} kx^2$.\n\nNow, add the terms together to get the potential in Cartesian coordinates, $V(x, y)$:\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k(x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} kx^2$\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2 + \\frac{3}{2} kx^2$\nCombine the terms with $x^2$:\n$V(x, y) = (\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}) kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{4}{2} kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n$V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n\n**2. Identify the system as two independent harmonic oscillators.**\n\nThe potential $V(x, y)$ is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of a function of $x$ only and a function of $y$ only:\n$V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$\nwhere:\n$V_x(x) = 2kx^2$\n$V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$\n\nThis form of potential describes a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator, which is equivalent to two independent 1D quantum harmonic oscillators, one oscillating in the x-direction and the other in the y-direction. The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of these two oscillators.\n\n**3. Find the energy eigenvalues for each oscillator.**\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with potential $V(q) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 q^2$ are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$ and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    The potential is $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$. We equate this to the standard form $\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_x^2 x^2$:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_x^2 = 2k \\implies m\\omega_x^2 = 4k \\implies \\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\n    $E_{n_x} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_x = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\left(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right)$\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    The potential is $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$. We equate this to $\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_y^2 y^2$:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_y^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k \\implies m\\omega_y^2 = k \\implies \\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\n    $E_{n_y} = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_y = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n**4. Sum the energies to find the total energy spectrum.**\n\nThe total energy $E$ is the sum of the energies from the independent x and y motions:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$\n$E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\left(2\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\left(\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right)$\n\nFactor out the common term $\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$:\n$E = \\left[ 2(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\nDistribute the factors inside the bracket:\n$E = \\left[ 2n_x + 2(\\frac{1}{2}) + n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n$E = \\left( 2n_x + 1 + n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\nCombine the constant terms:\n$E = \\left( 2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2} \\right) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n**5. Compare the result with the given options.**\n\nThe derived energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) \\hbar\\sqrt{k/m}$.\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) $E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) \\hbar*\\sqrt(k/m))$\nB) $E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) \\hbar*\\sqrt(k/m))$\nC) $E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)\\hbar*\\sqrt(k/m))$\nD) $E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) \\hbar*\\sqrt(k/m))$\n\nOur result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
