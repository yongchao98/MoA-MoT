    "An elegant way to solve this problem is by using the formalism of quantum mechanics. Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main goal is to compute the uncertainty in the measurement of the $P_z$ operator, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$, for a system in a specific quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:** The uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is defined by the standard deviation:\n    $$ \\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2} $$\n    For our problem, this becomes:\n    $$ \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} $$\n    This means I need to calculate two quantities: the expectation value of $P_z$, which is $\\langle P_z \\rangle$, and the expectation value of $P_z^2$, which is $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector:\n        $$ |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n        The problem states this is an eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. While this is good for context, the explicit form of the state vector is all I need for the calculation. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$.\n    *   The matrix for the operator $P_z$ is:\n        $$ P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n4.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Calculate $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ (Expectation Value of $P_z$):**\n        The formula for the expectation value is $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\n        First, I need the bra vector $\\langle \\psi |$, which is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all components are real, it's just the transpose:\n        $$ \\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n        Next, I'll calculate the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $$ P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n        Now, I can compute the inner product $\\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n        $$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) $$\n        $$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right) = \\hbar \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 0 $$\n        So, the expectation value of $P_z$ is 0.\n\n    *   **Calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ (Expectation Value of $P_z^2$):**\n        First, I need to find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$.\n        $$ P_z^2 = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n        Now, I calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$. Let's compute $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $$ P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n        Then, compute the inner product:\n        $$ \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) $$\n        $$ \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    Now I can plug the calculated values back into the uncertainty formula:\n    $$ \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} $$\n    $$ \\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\n6.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) $\\hbar/2$\n    B) $\\hbar$\n    C) $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$\n    D) $\\sqrt{2}\\hbar$\n\n    The calculated value matches option C.\n\nTo be absolutely sure, I will perform a quick calculation using a Python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define constants and operators\nhbar = 1  # We can set hbar=1 and add it back at the end.\nPz = hbar * np.array([[1, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, -1]])\n\n# Define the state vector\npsi = np.array([[-1/2],\n                [1/np.sqrt(2)],\n                [-1/2]])\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz\n# <Pz> = psi_dagger * Pz * psi\nPz_psi = np.dot(Pz, psi)\nexp_Pz = np.dot(psi.T, Pz_psi)\n\nprint(f\"Expectation value of Pz: {exp_Pz[0][0]} * hbar\")\n\n# Calculate the Pz^2 operator\nPz2 = np.dot(Pz, Pz)\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz^2\n# <Pz^2> = psi_dagger * Pz^2 * psi\nPz2_psi = np.dot(Pz2, psi)\nexp_Pz2 = np.dot(psi.T, Pz2_psi)\n\nprint(f\"Expectation value of Pz^2: {exp_Pz2[0][0]} * hbar^2\")\n\n# Calculate the uncertainty\n# Delta_Pz = sqrt(<Pz^2> - <Pz>^2)\nuncertainty_sq = exp_Pz2 - exp_Pz**2\nuncertainty = np.sqrt(uncertainty_sq[0][0])\n\nprint(f\"Uncertainty Delta_Pz: {uncertainty} * hbar\")\nprint(f\"Uncertainty Delta_Pz in terms of sqrt(2): {uncertainty * np.sqrt(2)} * hbar / sqrt(2)\")\n\n# Compare with hbar/sqrt(2)\n# 1/sqrt(2) is approximately 0.707\nval_C = 1/np.sqrt(2)\nprint(f\"hbar/sqrt(2) is approximately: {val_C}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to find the uncertainty, $\\Delta P_z$, of the operator $P_z$ for a system in a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Uncertainty Formula:** The uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is defined by the root-mean-square deviation from its expectation value. The formula is:\n    $$ \\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2} $$\n    For this problem, we need to calculate:\n    $$ \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} $$\n\n3.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   The operator $P_z$ in its matrix form is:\n        $$ P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    *   The state of the system, $|\\psi\\rangle$, is given by the column vector:\n        $$ |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    *   The problem also mentions that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. This is a crucial piece of information. The standard basis vectors correspond to these eigenvectors:\n        *   $|e_1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ is the eigenvector with eigenvalue $+\\hbar$.\n        *   $|e_2\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ is the eigenvector with eigenvalue $0$.\n        *   $|e_3\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ is the eigenvector with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$.\n\n4.  **Calculation Strategy:** We need to compute two quantities: $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ and $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$. We can do this in two ways: using matrix multiplication or by using the probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues. The second method is often simpler.\n\n    **Method 1: Using Probabilities**\n\n    *   First, we express the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of $P_z$:\n        $$ |\\psi\\rangle = (-1/2)|e_1\\rangle + (1/\\sqrt{2})|e_2\\rangle + (-1/2)|e_3\\rangle $$\n    *   The coefficients are $c_1 = -1/2$, $c_2 = 1/\\sqrt{2}$, and $c_3 = -1/2$.\n    *   The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of its corresponding coefficient.\n        *   Probability of measuring eigenvalue $p_z = +\\hbar$ is $P(+\\hbar) = |c_1|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\n        *   Probability of measuring eigenvalue $p_z = 0$ is $P(0) = |c_2|^2 = (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$.\n        *   Probability of measuring eigenvalue $p_z = -\\hbar$ is $P(-\\hbar) = |c_3|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\n        *   (Check: The probabilities sum to 1: $1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1$.)\n\n    *   **Calculate $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n        The expectation value is the sum of (eigenvalue × probability):\n        $$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = (+\\hbar)P(+\\hbar) + (0)P(0) + (-\\hbar)P(-\\hbar) $$\n        $$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = (\\hbar)(1/4) + (0)(1/2) + (-\\hbar)(1/4) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0 $$\n\n    *   **Calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n        The expectation value of $P_z^2$ is the sum of (eigenvalue² × probability):\n        $$ \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (+\\hbar)^2 P(+\\hbar) + (0)^2 P(0) + (-\\hbar)^2 P(-\\hbar) $$\n        $$ \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (\\hbar^2)(1/4) + (0)(1/2) + (\\hbar^2)(1/4) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} $$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation of Uncertainty:**\n    Now substitute the calculated expectation values back into the uncertainty formula:\n    $$ \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} $$\n    $$ \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} $$\n    $$ \\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This corresponds to option C.\n\n    *(Self-Correction/Verification: I could also use direct matrix multiplication as performed in the hidden thinking process, which gives the same result. The code execution also confirms this result numerically.)*\n\n<<<C>>>"
