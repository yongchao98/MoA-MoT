    "This problem is solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which connects the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty (or spread) in its energy.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The core principle here is the energy-time uncertainty relation: ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. In the context of atomic energy levels, Δt can be interpreted as the lifetime (τ) of the excited state, and ΔE represents the natural linewidth or the inherent uncertainty in the energy of that level. A common and practical form of the relation is ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where ΔE is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the energy distribution and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n*   **Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be \"clearly distinguished\" or \"resolved,\" the difference in their energies, |E2 - E1|, must be significantly larger than their energy uncertainties. A good criterion is that the energy difference should be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2). At the very least, the energy difference must be larger than the broader of the two energy widths.\n\n*   **Values Needed:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (τ1) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (τ2) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n*   **Calculations:**\n    1.  **Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state.**\n        *   ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n        *   ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n    2.  **Determine the minimum required energy separation.**\n        *   The state with the shorter lifetime (τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV). This broader line is the limiting factor for resolution.\n        *   To clearly resolve the two levels, their energy separation must be greater than this dominant energy width.\n        *   Required energy difference: |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. A more conservative condition would be |E2 - E1| > (ΔE1 + ΔE2) ≈ (6.6 x 10⁻⁷ + 0.66 x 10⁻⁷) eV ≈ 7.26 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   Let's check which of the given options satisfies the condition that the energy difference must be greater than ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n        *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is 1 x 10⁻⁴ eV. Since 10⁻⁴ is much larger than 7 x 10⁻⁷, this energy difference is sufficient for clear resolution.\n        *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n        *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is much smaller than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n        *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Only option A provides an energy separation large enough to overcome the natural line broadening of the states, allowing them to be clearly resolved.\n\nLet's confirm the calculation using a Python script.\n```python\n# Constants\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes of the states\ntau1 = 1e-9   # sec\ntau2 = 1e-8   # sec\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using Delta_E = h_bar / tau\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\n# The condition to resolve the two levels is that their energy difference\n# must be larger than their combined linewidths.\nrequired_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 1 (Delta_E1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 2 (Delta_E2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Required energy difference to resolve (Delta_E1 + Delta_E2): {required_energy_difference:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Compare with options\noption_A = 1e-4\noption_B = 1e-11\noption_C = 1e-8\noption_D = 1e-9\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nprint(f\"Is Option A ({option_A:.1e} eV) > Required Difference? {option_A > required_energy_difference}\")\nprint(f\"Is Option B ({option_B:.1e} eV) > Required Difference? {option_B > required_energy_difference}\")\nprint(f\"Is Option C ({option_C:.1e} eV) > Required Difference? {option_C > required_energy_difference}\")\nprint(f\"Is Option D ({option_D:.1e} eV) > Required Difference? {option_D > required_energy_difference}\")\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nEnergy uncertainty of state 1 (Delta_E1): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy uncertainty of state 2 (Delta_E2): 6.582e-08 eV\nRequired energy difference to resolve (Delta_E1 + Delta_E2): 7.240e-07 eV\n\nComparing with options:\nIs Option A (1.0e-04 eV) > Required Difference?

    "The problem requires us to apply the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which states that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time (in this case, the lifetime of the state, τ), and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). This principle implies that a state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly defined energy; instead, its energy is spread out over a range ΔE, often called the natural linewidth.\n\n**1. Understand the Concept of Resolution**\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly distinguished\" or \"resolved,\" the difference in their central energies (|E₂ - E₁|) must be significantly larger than their energy uncertainties (their linewidths). A conservative criterion is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths: |E₂ - E₁| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂.\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State**\n\nWe can approximate the energy width ΔE using the relation ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. Determine the Minimum Required Energy Separation**\n\nTo resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than the sum of their widths.\n\n*   Required energy difference > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n*   Required energy difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n*   Required energy difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   Required energy difference > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*Note: Even using a less strict criterion where the separation only needs to be larger than the broader of the two lines (ΔE₁ = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV), the conclusion remains the same.*\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nWe need to find the option that is greater than ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV = 1,000 x 10⁻⁷ eV.  This is much greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV. This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy separation large enough to overcome the natural line broadening of the states, allowing them to be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<A>>>"
