Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let's break down this name to understand its structure:\n*   **7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane:** This is the core structure. It consists of a cyclohexane ring fused with a three-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (an epoxide). The bridgehead carbons are C1 and C6. The epoxide is formed between C1 and C6.\n*   **1,3,4-trimethyl:** There are methyl groups attached to carbons 1, 3, and 4.\n*   **(1R,3R,4R,6S):** This defines the absolute stereochemistry at the chiral centers.\n\nLet's visualize the structure. We can draw the cyclohexane ring in a planar representation with wedges (up) and dashes (down) to show the stereochemistry.\n*   The bicyclo[4.1.0] system implies a cis-fusion. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing \"up\" (on a wedge).\n*   **At C1 (R):** The substituents are -O-, -C6-, -C2-, and -CH3. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C1 must also be \"up\" (wedge), cis to the epoxide.\n*   **At C6 (S):** The substituents are -O-, -C1-, -C5-, and -H. For the configuration to be S, the hydrogen atom at C6 must be \"down\" (dash), trans to the epoxide.\n*   **At C3 (R):** The substituents are -C2-, -C4-, -CH3, and -H. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C3 must be \"up\" (wedge).\n*   **At C4 (R):** The substituents are -C5-, -C3-, -CH3, and -H. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C4 must also be \"up\" (wedge).\n\n**Summary of the starting material's stereochemistry:** The epoxide ring and all three methyl groups are on the same face of the cyclohexane ring (we've defined this as \"up\" or beta).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Key Principles:**\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and attack epoxides via an Sₙ2-like mechanism. The attack occurs at the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack is a backside attack, meaning the nucleophile approaches from the side opposite the C-O bond. This results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Attack**\n\nThe epoxide is formed by carbons C1 and C6. We must determine which is less sterically hindered.\n*   **C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, C2, C6, and the epoxide oxygen. It is a **quaternary** carbon.\n*   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, C1, C5, and the epoxide oxygen. It is a **tertiary** carbon.\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻) from the cuprate will attack **C6**.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   **Attack at C6:** The C6-O bond is \"up\" (wedge). The nucleophile (Me⁻) must perform a backside attack, so it will approach from the \"down\" side (dash).\n*   **Ring Opening:** The C6-O bond breaks. The C1-O bond remains, forming a lithium alkoxide at C1. Subsequent acidic or aqueous workup protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Inversion at C6:** The starting configuration at C6 is **S**. The Sₙ2 attack causes an inversion of configuration, so the new stereocenter at this carbon will be **R**. The new methyl group will be \"down\" (alpha), and the original hydrogen at C6 will be pushed \"up\" (beta).\n*   **Stereochemistry at other centers:** The configurations at C1, C3, and C4 are not directly involved in the reaction, so their stereochemistry is retained.\n    *   C1 remains **R**.\n    *   C3 remains **R**.\n    *   C4 remains **R**.\n\n**5. Name the Final Product**\n\n*   **Structure:** The product is a cyclohexanol. The -OH group is at the original C1 position. There are methyl groups at the original C1, C3, C4 positions, and a new methyl group at the original C6 position.\n*   **IUPAC Numbering:** The carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1. We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   New C1 = Old C1\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise gives methyl groups at C1, C2(old C6), C4(old C4), and C5(old C3). The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise gives methyl groups at C1, C3(old C4), C4(old C3), and C6(old C6). The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower. So the name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   **Absolute Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **New C1 (Old C1):** Configuration is retained -> **R**.\n    *   **New C2 (Old C6):** Configuration is inverted (S -> R) -> **R**.\n    *   **New C4 (Old C4):** Configuration is retained -> **R**.\n    *   **New C5 (Old C3):** Configuration is retained -> **R**.\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\n\n*   A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur derived product matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method in organic synthesis for carbon-carbon bond formation. The reaction proceeds via an S_N2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and the stereoselectivity of the product.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The prompt states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and are highly sensitive to steric hindrance. In the starting material, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, the epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to two other ring carbons (C2, C6) and the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom and two other ring carbons (C1, C5) and the epoxide oxygen.\n    Due to the significant steric bulk of the methyl group on C1 compared to the hydrogen on C6, the incoming nucleophilic methyl group from Me2CuLi will preferentially attack the less hindered **C6**. This regioselectivity eliminates options C and D, which would result from an attack at C1.\n\n2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds through an S_N2-type mechanism. A key feature of the S_N2 reaction is the inversion of configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked by the nucleophile. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond (backside attack).\n    *   The initial configuration at the site of attack, C6, is given as **(S)**.\n    *   The S_N2 attack by the methyl nucleophile will invert this stereocenter. Therefore, the configuration of this carbon in the product will be **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenters not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming process (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their original configurations.\n\n**Determining the Product:**\n\n*   The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,**6S**)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   The nucleophilic methyl group attacks C6.\n*   The C6-O bond breaks, and after an acidic workup, the oxygen at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with methyl groups at the original positions (C1, C3, C4) and a new methyl group at C6.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature for the product, the carbon bearing the -OH group (original C1) is now C1. The carbon that was attacked (original C6) is now C2.\n*   The stereochemistry of the product will be:\n    *   C1 retains its configuration: **(1R)**\n    *   C6 inverts to become C2: (6S) → **(2R)**\n    *   C4 retains its configuration: **(4R)**\n    *   C3 retains its configuration and becomes C5: **(5R)**\n\nCombining these, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   The substrate is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 with the specified absolute configurations.\n    *   The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n    *   The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n2.  **Determine the Regiochemistry:**\n    *   The problem states that the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide is across C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. The methyl nucleophile will attack C6.\n    *   The attack breaks the C6-O bond, and the oxygen (attached to C1) is later protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Constitution of the Product:**\n    *   The reaction adds a methyl group to C6 and creates a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   The starting molecule has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The product will have an -OH and a -CH₃ on the original C1. It will have a new -CH₃ on the original C6. It will retain the original -CH₃ groups at C3 and C4.\n    *   The product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol. To name it via IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as C1. The ring is then numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   The methyl groups are at the new C1, new C2 (old C6), new C4 (old C4), and new C5 (old C3). The locants are 1, 2, 4, 5.\n    *   The product is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options A and B, which are constitutional isomers resulting from attack at the wrong carbon.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The reaction is an Sₙ2-type attack, which proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C6).\n    *   The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) **retain their absolute configuration**.\n    *   Let's map the stereocenters from the reactant to the product:\n        *   Reactant C1 (R) → Product C1 (R)\n        *   Reactant C3 (R) → Product C5 (R)\n        *   Reactant C4 (R) → Product C4 (R)\n        *   Reactant C6 (S) → Product C2 (inverted configuration)\n    *   So, the product must have the configuration (1R, 4R, 5R). This is consistent with both options C and D.\n    *   The final step is to determine the configuration at C2, which results from the inversion of C6(S). While the geometric configuration is inverted, the R/S descriptor might not flip from S to R because the priorities of the substituents change. We must analyze this carefully.\n        *   Priorities at reactant C6: O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4). The configuration is (S).\n        *   Priorities at product C2: C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n        *   The Sₙ2 reaction causes a Walden inversion, meaning the spatial arrangement of the three non-reacting groups (H, C1, C5) is inverted relative to the central carbon.\n        *   Let's analyze the consequence for the R/S descriptor. A detailed analysis shows that when the leaving group (O, priority 1) is replaced by the incoming nucleophile (Me, priority 3), and the other priorities shift, the descriptor for the inverted center remains (S).\n        *   Therefore, C6(S) becomes C2(S) after the reaction.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The product has the absolute configuration (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R).\n    *   This corresponds to the name (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to identify the product of a chemical reaction.\n# Based on the step-by-step analysis:\n# 1.

The `7-oxa` indicates that the single-atom bridge of the cyclopropane is an oxygen atom, forming an epoxide fused to the cyclohexane ring. The fusion points are C1 and C6.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configurations are given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n\nLet's visualize the structure. We can draw the cyclohexane ring with the epoxide fused to it. The stereochemistry at C1 and C6 determines that the epoxide ring is cis-fused. Let's assume the oxygen atom is on the 'up' (beta) face of the ring.\n*   At **C1**, which is `R`, the C1-O bond is 'up'. For it to be R, the methyl group at C1 must be 'down' (alpha).\n*   At **C6**, which is `S`, the C6-O bond is 'up'. For it to be S, the hydrogen atom at C6 must be 'down' (alpha).\n*   At **C3**, which is `R`, the methyl group must be 'down' (alpha).\n*   At **C4**, which is `R`, the methyl group must also be 'down' (alpha).\n\nSo, the starting epoxide has the oxygen atom on one face, and all three methyl groups are on the opposite face.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagent and Reaction Type**\n\nThe reagent is **Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate)**, a Gilman reagent.\n*   This reagent is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Regioselectivity of the Attack**\n\nThe problem states a key rule for organocuprates reacting with epoxides: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **C6** is a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom).\n*   Clearly, C6 is sterically less hindered than C1.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack by the methyl group will occur at **C6**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereoselectivity of the Attack**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via an **Sₙ2 mechanism**. The problem states: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n*   This means the nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond being broken (the backside).\n*   In our structure, the C6-O bond is on the 'up' face.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile must attack C6 from the **'down' face**.\n*   This attack breaks the C6-O bond and causes an **inversion of configuration** at C6. The hydrogen atom at C6, which was 'down', is pushed to the 'up' position. The new methyl group is added to the 'down' position.\n*   The C1-O bond also breaks (after the initial attack), and upon aqueous workup, the resulting alkoxide is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The configuration at C1 is retained.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Structure and Name of the Product**\n\nLet's summarize the resulting structure:\n*   The cyclohexane ring is opened to form a cyclohexanol.\n*   The hydroxyl group (-OH) is at the original C1 position, and its stereochemistry is retained ('up').\n*   The methyl group at the original C1 position remains 'down'.\n*   The methyl groups at C3 and C4 remain 'down'.\n*   A new methyl group is added at the original C6 position and is 'down'.\n\nNow, we must name this product according to IUPAC rules:\n*   **Parent Name:** The main functional group is the alcohol, so it is a `cyclohexanol`. The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new **C1**.\n*   **Numbering:** We number the ring to give the substituents (the four methyl groups) the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Starting from the OH-carbon as C1, numbering counter-clockwise (towards the original C6) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise would give locants {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower, so we use this numbering scheme.\n*   **Full Name (without stereochemistry):** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nWe need to determine the R/S configuration for the chiral centers in the product: C1, C2, C4, and C5.\n*   **New C1 (original C1):** The configuration is retained. It was R in the starting material. So, it is **1R**.\n*   **New C2 (original C6):** The configuration is inverted due to the Sₙ2 attack. The original configuration was S. One might assume it becomes R, but we must re-evaluate using CIP rules because the substituent priorities have changed.\n    *   At New C2, the groups are H ('up'), Me ('down'), C1, and C3.\n    *   Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H.\n    *   With the lowest priority group (H) pointing towards us ('up'), we trace the path from C1 → C3 → Me, which is clockwise. A clockwise path with the lowest priority group towards the viewer means the configuration is **S**. So, it is **2S**.\n*   **New C4 (original C4):** The configuration is retained. It was R. So, it is **4R**.\n*   **New C5 (original C3):** The configuration is retained. It was R. So, it is **5R**.\n\nCombining these, the full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Core Structure:** The `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` indicates a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring. The `7-oxa` means the single-atom bridge of the cyclopropane is an oxygen atom, which defines an epoxide fused to the cyclohexane ring at carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The given R/S configurations define the 3D structure. A detailed analysis shows:\n    *   The epoxide ring is on the α-face (pointing \"down\" relative to the plane of the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   The methyl group at C1 is on the β-face (\"up\").\n    *   The methyl group at C3 is on the α-face (\"down\").\n    *   The methyl group at C4 is on the α-face (\"down\").\n    *   The hydrogen atom at C6 is on the β-face (\"up\").\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (CH₃⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem states that organocuprates attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    *   The epoxide is formed by C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C6, C2, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and the nucleophilic attack will occur at C6.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction is an Sₙ2-type attack. The problem states that this results in an \"inversion of configuration\" at the carbon where the nucleophile adds.\n    *   The nucleophile (CH₃⁻) must attack from the side opposite to the C-O bond being broken.\n    *   The C6-O bond is on the α-face (down).\n    *   Therefore, the methyl group will attack C6 from the β-face (top).\n\n**3. Predict the Product Structure**\n\n1.  **Attack at C6:** The incoming methyl group adds to the β-face of C6. The C6-O bond breaks. This causes an inversion of configuration at C6. The original configuration of C6 was S, so the new configuration at this carbon will be R.\n2.  **Ring Opening:** The C1-O bond also breaks, and the oxygen atom remains attached to C1. After an aqueous workup (which is standard procedure), this oxygen is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The stereochemistry at C1 is not affected by the reaction, so the -OH group will be on the α-face (down), just as the oxygen atom was.\n3.  **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so they retain their original R configurations.\n\n**4. Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product**\n\n1.  **Parent Chain:** The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is assigned the lowest possible number, C1. So, the original C1 of the reactant is the new C1 of the product.\n2.  **Numbering:** We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the new C1 towards the original C6 (which is now substituted with the new methyl group) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. (The alternative numbering would give 1, 3, 4, 6, which is a higher set of locants).\n    *   New C1 ← Old C1\n    *   New C2 ← Old C6\n    *   New C4 ← Old C4\n    *   New C5 ← Old C3\n3.  **Base Name:** The product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-).\n\n**5. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nWe now assign the R/S configuration to each stereocenter in the product based on the reaction mechanism:\n*   **New C1 (from Old C1):** The configuration is retained. Old C1 was R. → **1R**.\n*   **New C2 (from Old C6):** The configuration is inverted. Old C6 was S. → **2R**.\n*   **New C4 (from Old C4):** The configuration is retained. Old C4 was R. → **4R**.\n*   **New C5 (from Old C3):** The configuration is retained. Old C3 was R. → **5R**.\n\nCombining these, the full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe reaction of saturated epoxides with organocuprates, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method in organic synthesis for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The reaction follows a set of predictable rules for regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, which can be used to determine the structure of the product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexene oxide. The bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane core indicates a cyclohexane ring fused to a three-membered ring, and the \"7-oxa\" designation confirms this is an epoxide. The stereochemistry (1R,3R,4R,6S) defines the specific three-dimensional arrangement of the substituents. Based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules, the epoxide oxygen and the methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4 are all on the same face of the cyclohexane ring (beta, or 'up').\n\n2.  **Reagent:** The reagent is Me2CuLi, lithium dimethylcuprate. In this reagent, the methyl group (Me) acts as a soft nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Regioselectivity:** The first rule provided states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate is introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the other ring carbons.\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon, bonded only to hydrogen and the other ring carbons.\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and the nucleophilic methyl group will attack this position.\n\n4.  **Stereoselectivity:** The second rule states that inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is characteristic of an S_N2-type reaction mechanism. The nucleophile attacks the carbon from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond of the epoxide (anti-attack).\n    *   In the starting material, the epoxide ring is on the beta face ('up').\n    *   The methyl nucleophile must therefore attack C6 from the alpha face ('down').\n    *   This attack breaks the C6-O bond and causes an inversion of the stereocenter at C6. The hydrogen originally at C6 (alpha) is pushed to the beta position, and the new methyl group takes the alpha position.\n    *   The C1-O bond also breaks (as part of the ring opening), and the oxygen atom is protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The stereocenter at C1 is not attacked and retains its original configuration. The resulting -OH group will be on the beta face.\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are also unaffected by the reaction and retain their configurations.\n\n### Determining the Product Structure and Name\n\nFollowing the reaction, a new product is formed:\n*   The cyclohexane ring remains.\n*   An alcohol (-OH) is formed at C1, with beta stereochemistry.\n*   A new methyl group is added at C6, with alpha stereochemistry.\n*   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 retain their positions and stereochemistry.\n\nTo name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. Numbering proceeds around the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants, which results in a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\nThe final step is to assign the absolute configuration (R/S) to each chiral center in the product:\n*   **C1:** Retains its original R configuration.\n*   **C2 (originally C6):** The starting configuration was S. The SN2 attack causes a geometric inversion. However, due to changes in substituent priorities under the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules, the final designation for this center is S. This is a known phenomenon where geometric inversion does not lead to an R/S descriptor change.\n*   **C4 (originally C4):** Retains its original R configuration.\n*   **C5 (originally C3):** Retains its original R configuration.\n\nTherefore, the final product is (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe analysis of the reaction between an epoxide and an organocuprate relies on well-established principles of organic chemistry. The reaction of an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), with an epoxide proceeds via a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) mechanism. This mechanism has specific consequences for both the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analysis of Reactants:**\n*   **Substrate:** The epoxide is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This name describes a cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide ring (forming the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane core). The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6. There are methyl substituents at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me2CuLi, a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of the nucleophilic methyl anion (Me-).\n\n**2. Regioselectivity:**\nOrganocuprates are known to attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   In the given epoxide, the two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the other ring carbons.\n*   C6 is a secondary carbon.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered **C6**.\n\n**3. Stereochemistry:**\nThe reaction proceeds through an SN2-type mechanism, which results in the inversion of configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n*   The nucleophile (Me-) attacks C6.\n*   The initial configuration at C6 is (S).\n*   Due to the inversion of configuration, the new stereocenter at this carbon in the product will be **(R)**.\n*   The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, and C4) are not involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps and thus remain unchanged as (1R, 3R, 4R).\n\n**4. Product Identification and Nomenclature:**\nThe attack of the methyl group on C6 opens the epoxide ring, and subsequent protonation (during workup) places a hydroxyl (-OH) group on C1. The resulting product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol. To name the product according to IUPAC rules:\n*   The carbon bearing the hydroxyl group receives the highest priority and is numbered C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant.\n*   The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the new C1 towards the carbon that was attacked (the original C6) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   The name is therefore **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5. Final Stereochemical Assignment:**\nCombining the stereochemical outcomes with the new IUPAC numbering:\n*   **New C1** (from original C1): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **New C2** (from original C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n*   **New C4** (from original C4): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **New C5** (from original C3): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\nThus, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe reaction involves the ring-opening of a substituted epoxide by an organocuprate, specifically a Gilman reagent (Me2CuLi). The fundamental principles governing this reaction are key to determining the correct product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a bicyclic compound where an epoxide ring is fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring.\n    *   **Reagent**: Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi). This reagent acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and, in reactions with epoxides, they attack the less sterically hindered carbon atom.\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by the oxygen atom and carbons C1 and C6 of the bicyclic system.\n    *   Carbon C1 is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group and three other carbons (C2, C5, and C6).\n    *   Carbon C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen and three other carbons (C1, C2, and C5).\n    *   Comparing the two, C6 is the less sterically hindered position. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The ring-opening of epoxides by organocuprates proceeds via an Sₙ2-type mechanism. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond (anti-attack), leading to an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n    *   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6.\n    *   This causes an inversion of the stereochemistry at C6. The starting material has a (6S) configuration. After the reaction, this center will have an (R) configuration.\n    *   The stereocenter at C1 is not involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming step with the nucleophile, so its configuration (1R) is retained.\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are also unaffected, so their configurations (3R, 4R) are retained.\n\n### Determining the Product Structure\n\n*   **Attack at C6**: The methyl group adds to C6.\n*   **Ring Opening**: The C6-O bond breaks, and the C1-O bond becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH) after an aqueous workup (which is implicit in this type of reaction).\n*   **Resulting Structure**: The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with methyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 4 from the original molecule, plus a new methyl group at the site of attack (C6).\n*   **IUPAC Naming of the Product**:\n    *   The carbon bearing the -OH group is C1. This carbon also has a methyl group.\n    *   The adjacent carbon that was attacked (originally C6) is now C2. It has the newly added methyl group.\n    *   The original C4 is still C4.\n    *   The original C3 is now C5.\n    *   The product is named 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n### Determining the Product Stereochemistry\n\n*   **C1**: Configuration is retained as (R).\n*   **C2 (from C6)**: Configuration inverts from (S) to (R).\n*   **C4 (from C4)**: Configuration is retained as (R).\n*   **C5 (from C3)**: Configuration is retained as (R).\n\nCombining these, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nB) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nC) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nD) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe calculated product matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons, C1 and C6.

Let's assume the plane of the cyclohexane ring is the reference.\n\n1.  Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing 'up' (beta face).\n2.  We need to place the substituents (Me on C1, H on C6, Me on C3, Me on C4) as either 'up' (beta) or 'down' (alpha) to satisfy the given R/S configurations.\n    *   **At C6 (S):** The groups are O, C1, C5, H. Priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. With the O 'up', for the configuration to be S, the H at C6 must also be 'up' (beta, syn to the epoxide).\n    *   **At C1 (R):** The groups are O, C6, C2, Me. Priorities are O > C6 > C2 > Me. With the O 'up', for the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C1 must be 'down' (alpha, anti to the epoxide).\n    *   **At C4 (R):** The groups are C3, C5, Me, H. Priorities are C3 > C5 > Me > H. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C4 must be 'up' (beta).\n    *   **At C3 (R):** The groups are C4, C2, Me, H. Priorities are C4 > C2 > Me > H. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C3 must be 'down' (alpha).\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n*   Epoxide oxygen: **up (beta)**\n*   C1-Methyl: **down (alpha)**\n*   C3-Methyl: **down (alpha)**\n*   C4-Methyl: **up (beta)**\n*   C6-Hydrogen: **up (beta)**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). The nucleophile is effectively a methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates attack the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at **C6**.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an **Sₙ2 mechanism**. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the leaving group (the C-O bond), resulting in an **inversion of configuration** at the center of attack.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product Structure**\n\n1.  The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6. The C6-O bond is 'up' (beta), so the attack occurs from the 'down' (alpha) side.\n2.  The C6-O bond breaks. The C1-O bond also breaks, and the oxygen atom becomes an alkoxide (O⁻), which is then protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n3.  Let's trace the stereochemistry of each part of the molecule:\n    *   **At C1:** The configuration is **retained**. The original C1-Me was 'down' (alpha), and it remains 'down'. The C1-O bond was 'up' (beta), so the new C1-OH group is 'up' (beta).\n    *   **At C6:** The configuration is **inverted**. The incoming methyl group adds from the 'down' (alpha) side. The original C6-H was 'up' (beta), and it remains 'up'.\n    *   **At C3 and C4:** These centers are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations are **retained**. C3-Me remains 'down' (alpha), and C4-Me remains 'up' (beta).\n\n**Summary of Product's Relative Stereochemistry:**\n*   C1-OH: **up (beta)**\n*   C1-Me: **down (alpha)**\n*   C3-Me: **down (alpha)**\n*   C4-Me: **up (beta)**\n*   C6-Me (newly added): **down (alpha)**\n\n**Step 4: Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product**\n\n1.  **Numbering:** The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. The -OH group gets priority, so it is on C1. We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants. The methyl groups are on C1, C3, C4, and C6 of the original ring.\n    *   Numbering C1 → C6 → C5 → C4 → C3 → C2 as the new 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 gives methyl locants of {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering C1 → C2 → C3 → C4 → C5 → C6 as the new 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 gives methyl locants of {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower than {1, 3, 4, 6}. So the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches options A and B.\n\n2.  **Assigning R/S Configuration to the Product:** We use the relative stereochemistry determined in Step 3 and the new numbering system.\n    *   New C1 is original C1.\n    *   New C2 is original C6.\n    *   New C4 is original C4.\n    *   New C5 is original C3.\n\n    Let's assign the configuration for each chiral center using wedges (up, beta) and dashes (down, alpha).\n    *   **C1:** OH (wedge), Me (dash). Priorities: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. Looking down the C1-Me bond (lowest priority, dash), the path OH → C2 → C6 is clockwise. **C1 is (R)**.\n    *   **C2 (from C6):** Me (dash), H (wedge). Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H. Looking down the C2-H bond (lowest priority, wedge), the path C1 → C3 → Me is clockwise. Since we are looking from the front, we reverse the result. Clockwise → Counter-clockwise. **C2 is (S)**.\n    *   **C4 (from C4):** Me (wedge), H (dash). Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. Looking down the C4-H bond (lowest priority, dash), the path C5 → C3 → Me is clockwise. **C4 is (R)**.\n    *   **C5 (from C3):** Me (dash), H (wedge). Priorities: C4 > C6 > Me > H. Looking down the C5-H bond (lowest priority, wedge), the path C4 → C6 → Me is counter-clockwise. Reverse the result. Counter-clockwise → Clockwise. **C5 is (R)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product has the stereochemistry **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)**.\nThe full name is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n*   **Scaffold:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` is the IUPAC name for cyclohexene oxide. It consists of a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons, which are numbered C1 and C6 according to bicyclic nomenclature.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configuration at the chiral centers is given as 1R, 3R, 4R, 6S.\n\nLet's determine the 3D structure. We can draw the molecule in a half-chair conformation, which is typical for cyclohexene derivatives. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing \"up\" (on the β face).\n*   **At C1 (must be R):** The priorities are O > C6 > C2 > CH3. For the configuration to be (R) with the oxygen \"up\", the C1-methyl group must be pointing \"down\" (on the α face).\n*   **At C6 (must be S):** The priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. For the configuration to be (S) with the oxygen \"up\", the hydrogen at C6 must also be pointing \"up\" (on the β face).\n*   **At C3 (must be R):** The priorities are C4(with Me) > C2 > CH3 > H. For the configuration to be (R), the C3-methyl group must be in an axial-like \"down\" position (α face).\n*   **At C4 (must be R):** The priorities are C3(with Me) > C5 > CH3 > H. For the configuration to be (R), the C4-methyl group must be in an equatorial-like \"up\" position (β face).\n\nSo, the starting epoxide has the following stereochemical features (visualized with the epoxide ring on the top face):\n*   Epoxide O: Up (β)\n*   C1-Me: Down (α)\n*   C3-Me: Down (α)\n*   C4-Me: Up (β)\n*   C6-H: Up (β)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me2CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. The nucleophile is a methyl anion (Me⁻), which is considered a \"soft\" nucleophile.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem states that for saturated epoxides, the organocuprate attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, O, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, O, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at **C6**.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an **SN2 mechanism**, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the center of attack. The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond. Since the C6-O bond is \"up\" (β), the methyl group will attack from the \"down\" side (α). This is known as an anti-diaxial opening.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product Structure**\n\n1.  The Me⁻ group attacks C6 from the α face (\"down\").\n2.  The C6-O bond breaks. The oxygen, which is attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide (O⁻).\n3.  A subsequent acidic workup (not explicitly shown but always implied) protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n4.  The resulting molecule is a substituted cyclohexanol. The ring will adopt a stable chair conformation.\n\nLet's track the stereochemistry of each group in the product:\n*   **At C1:** The C1-O bond becomes C1-OH. Since the oxygen was \"up\" (β), the OH group is \"up\" (β). The original C1-Me group was \"down\" (α) and remains so.\n*   **At C6:** The incoming Me group attacks from \"down\" (α). The original H at C6 was \"up\" (β) and remains so.\n*   **At C3 & C4:** The methyl groups are not involved in the reaction and retain their original stereochemistry: C3-Me is \"down\" (α) and C4-Me is \"up\" (β).\n\n**Step 4: Name the Product and Determine its Absolute Configuration**\n\nFirst, we need to number the cyclohexane ring of the product according to IUPAC rules. The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the carbon bearing the -OH group is **C1**. This corresponds to the original C1 of the epoxide.\n\nWe then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n*   Path 1 (clockwise): C1 -> orig C2 -> orig C3 -> orig C4 -> orig C5 -> orig C6. Methyl groups are at 1, 3, 4, 6.\n*   Path 2 (counter-clockwise): C1 -> orig C6 -> orig C5 -> orig C4 -> orig C3 -> orig C2. Methyl groups are at 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\nThe set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower than {1, 3, 4, 6}, so we use the counter-clockwise numbering. The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options C and D.\n\nNow, we must determine the absolute configuration (R/S) at the chiral centers (C1, C2, C4, C5) of the most stable conformer.\n\n*   **Conformational Analysis:** The anti-diaxial opening initially produces a high-energy chair conformer with the C1-OH and the new C2-Me in axial positions. The ring will flip to a more stable conformer.\n    *   Initial conformer (less stable): C1-OH (axial), C1-Me (equatorial), C2-Me (axial), C4-Me (equatorial), C5-Me (axial). (3 axial groups)\n    *   Flipped conformer (more stable): C1-OH (equatorial), C1-Me (axial), C2-Me (equatorial), C4-Me (axial), C5-Me (equatorial). (2 axial groups)\n    We will assign the R/S configuration based on this more stable flipped conformer.\n\n*   **R/S Assignment (on the stable conformer):**\n    *   **C1:** Has OH (eq, β), Me (ax, α). Priorities: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. Viewing down the C1-Me (axial) bond, the path OH → C2 → C6 is clockwise. **C1 is (R)**.\n    *   **C2 (orig C6):** Has Me (eq, α), H (ax, β). Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H. Viewing down the C2-H (axial) bond, the path C1 → C3 → Me is counter-clockwise. **C2 is (S)**.\n    *   **C4 (orig C4):** Has Me (ax, β), H (eq, α). Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. Viewing down the C4-H (equatorial) bond is tricky, but careful analysis shows the path C5 → C3 → Me is clockwise. **C4 is (R)**.\n    *   **C5 (orig C3):** Has Me (eq, α), H (ax, β). Priorities: C4 > C6 > Me > H. Viewing down the C5-H (axial) bond, the path C4 → C6 → Me is clockwise. **C5 is (R)**.\n\nCombining these results, the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires us to predict the product of a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide using an organocuprate reagent.

This makes C1 a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is also part of the epoxide but has no methyl substituent. It is bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon.\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the methyl nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\n\nThe reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the site of attack.\n*   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6.\n*   The initial configuration at C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n*   The Sₙ2 attack inverts this configuration, so the new stereocenter at this position will be **(R)**.\n*   The attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1. A subsequent aqueous workup (which is standard procedure to isolate the alcohol product) protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the reaction, so their configurations remain unchanged: (1R), (3R), and (4R).\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Structure and IUPAC Name**\n\nThe reaction opens the bicyclic system to form a substituted cyclohexanol.\n*   **Structure:** The product has an -OH group at the original C1 position and a new methyl group at the original C6 position. The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are also present.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the carbon bearing the -OH group (the original C1) is designated as **C1** in the product's name.\n    2.  We must number the ring to give the substituents (the four methyl groups) the lowest possible set of locants. The methyl groups are at positions corresponding to the original C1, C3, C4, and the newly added one on C6.\n        *   **Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1:** The methyl groups are at positions 1 (on new C1), 2 (the new methyl on original C6), 4 (on original C4), and 5 (on original C3). This gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n        *   **Numbering clockwise from the new C1:** The methyl groups would be at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. This gives the locant set {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    3.  Comparing the locant sets {1, 2, 4, 5} and {1, 3, 4, 6}, the first set is lower. Thus, the correct base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n*   **Assigning Final Stereochemistry:** We use the correct (counter-clockwise) numbering to assign the stereodescriptors.\n    *   **New C1** (was original C1): Configuration is retained → **(R)**.\n    *   **New C2** (was original C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) → **(R)**.\n    *   **New C4** (was original C4): Configuration is retained → **(R)**.\n    *   **New C5** (was original C3): Configuration is retained → **(R)**.\n\nThe full and correct IUPAC name for the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our derived product name with the given options:\n*   **A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This matches our result perfectly.\n*   B) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect numbering.\n*   C) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect numbering and stereochemistry.\n*   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect stereochemistry at C2 (implies retention of configuration, which is incorrect for this mechanism).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    *   The starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n    *   `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   `7-oxa` indicates that the single-atom bridge is an oxygen atom, meaning this is an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   The substituents are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   To determine the 3D structure, we use the given stereochemistry (1R,3R,4R,6S). We can draw the molecule on a plane with wedges (up) and dashes (down) to represent its stereochemistry. A consistent assignment is:\n        *   The epoxide oxygen is on the 'up' face (beta, wedge).\n        *   The methyl group at C1 is 'down' (alpha, dash). This gives the (1R) configuration. (Priorities: O > C6 > C2 > Me).\n        *   The hydrogen at C6 is 'down' (alpha, dash). This gives the (6S) configuration. (Priorities: O > C1 > C5 > H).\n        *   The methyl group at C3 is 'down' (alpha, dash). This gives the (3R) configuration. (Priorities: C4 > C2 > Me > H).\n        *   The methyl group at C4 is 'down' (alpha, dash). This gives the (4R) configuration. (Priorities: C3 > C5 > Me > H).\n    *   So, the starting material has the epoxide ring on one face of the cyclohexane ring, and the methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are all on the opposite face.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reagent and Reaction:**\n    *   The reagent is **Me2CuLi** (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of the soft nucleophile, methyl anion (Me⁻).\n    *   The problem states two key rules for the reaction of organocuprates with epoxides:\n        1.  The alkyl group attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n        2.  The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n3.  **Determine the Site of Attack:**\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, O, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, O, and a hydrogen).\n    *   C6 is less sterically hindered than C1. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The attack is an Sₙ2 reaction. The nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack from the side opposite to the C6-O bond.\n    *   In our model, the C6-O bond is 'up'. Thus, the Me⁻ attacks C6 from the 'down' side.\n    *   This attack causes an inversion of configuration at C6. The hydrogen atom at C6, which was 'down', is pushed 'up'. The new methyl group from the cuprate is added to the 'down' position.\n    *   The C6-O bond breaks, and the oxygen atom, which is still attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide (O⁻). After acidic workup (implied), it becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH). Since the original C1-O bond was 'up', the resulting OH group at C1 will also be 'up'.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Product Structure:**\n    *   The product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n    *   The OH group is at C1 and is 'up'.\n    *   The original methyl group at C1 is 'down'.\n    *   The original methyl group at C3 is 'down'.\n    *   The original methyl group at C4 is 'down'.\n    *   The new methyl group (from Me2CuLi) is at C6 and is 'down'.\n    *   So, the final product has an 'up' OH group, and all four methyl groups are 'down' (i.e., trans to the OH group).\n\n6.  **Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product:**\n    *   First, we must number the product according to IUPAC rules. The carbon bearing the -OH group is C1. We then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   The methyl groups are at positions corresponding to the original C1, C3, C4, and C6. Numbering from the new C1 (original C1), the methyl locants are {1, 3, 4, 6}, regardless of whether we number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   *Note*: The options provide product names with locants {1, 2, 4, 5} or {2, 2, 4, 5}. This indicates a flaw in the problem statement, as the locants derived from the starting material do not match those in the options. We must assume this is a typo in the question and proceed by determining the correct stereochemistry (R/S configuration) of the product we've derived, and find the option that matches it. The most likely scenario is that the attacked carbon (original C6) becomes C2 in the product name provided in the options.\n    *   Now, we assign the R/S configuration to each chiral center of our derived product structure (OH up, all four Me down), assuming the numbering {1, 2, 4, 5} as given in options B and D.\n        *   **C1**: Has OH(up), Me(down). Priorities: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. With Me(4) pointing away (down/dash), the sequence OH(1)→C2(2)→C6(3) is clockwise. Thus, **C1 is (R)**.\n        *   **C2 (original C6)**: Has new Me(down), H(up). Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H. With H(4) pointing towards us (up/wedge), the sequence C1(1)→C3(2)→Me(3) is clockwise. Since H is towards us, we reverse the assignment. Thus, **C2 is (S)**.\n        *   **C4**: Has Me(down), H(up). Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. With H(4) pointing towards us (up/wedge), the sequence C5(1)→C3(2)→Me(3) is counter-clockwise. We reverse the assignment. Thus, **C4 is (R)**.\n        *   **C5**: Has Me(down), H(up). Priorities: C4 > C6 > Me > H. With H(4) pointing towards us (up/wedge), the sequence C4(1)→C6(2)→Me(3) is clockwise. We reverse the assignment. Thus, **C5 is (S)**.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate the C5 assignment using a chair conformation, as planar drawings can be misleading. In the most stable chair, C5-Me is axial (down) and C5-H is equatorial (up). Let's put the lowest priority group (H) in the back by rotating the molecule. This is complex. Let's re-verify the C5 R/S assignment from the options. Both B and D list C5 as (R). Let's re-calculate.\n    *   Let's use the stable chair conformation: OH(eq,up), C1-Me(ax,down), C2-Me(eq,down), C4-Me(eq,down), C5-Me(ax,down).\n        *   **C5**: Me is axial down (away). H is equatorial up (front-ish). Priorities: C4(1) > C6(2) > Me(3) > H(4). Let's put Me(3) in the back. The sequence C4(1) -> C6(2) -> H(4) is clockwise. So, **C5 is (R)**.\n    *   So the calculated stereochemistry is **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   Our calculated product stereochemistry is (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R).\n    *   This matches option B exactly.\n\nA) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect locants and stereochemistry.\nB) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - **Matches our derived stereochemistry.**\nC) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect locants and stereochemistry.\nD) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n\nDespite the inconsistency in the locant numbering between the starting material and the options, the stereochemical outcome of the reaction points unambiguously to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe reaction of an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), with an epoxide is a well-established method in organic synthesis for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The reaction follows a set of predictable rules regarding its regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, which are key to determining the final product.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. There are also methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4 with the specified R/S configurations.\n    *   **Reagent**: Me2CuLi (a Gilman reagent) provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me-).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: Organocuprates are considered \"soft\" nucleophiles. In reactions with epoxides, they preferentially attack the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide ring.\n    *   In the given epoxide, the two carbons of the ring are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The ring-opening of epoxides by organocuprates proceeds via an SN2-type mechanism. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond, resulting in an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, which has an (S) configuration in the starting material. Due to the SN2 inversion, its configuration in the product will become (R).\n    *   The C1-O bond of the epoxide opens to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The configuration at C1 is retained, so it remains (R).\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations also remain (R).\n\n**Determining the Product Structure and Name:**\n\n1.  **Structure**: The reaction adds a new methyl group to C6 and creates a hydroxyl group at C1. The product is therefore a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n\n2.  **IUPAC Naming**: To name the product, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (the -OH) is designated as C1. The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   The original C1 (now with an -OH and a methyl group) is the new C1.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2 (the newly added one), 4, and 5. The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise would give methyl groups at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is preferred as it is lower. Thus, the product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n3.  **Final Stereochemistry**:\n    *   **Product C1** (from reactant C1): Configuration is retained as (R).\n    *   **Product C2** (from reactant C6): Configuration inverts from (S) to (R).\n    *   **Product C4** (from reactant C4): Configuration is retained as (R).\n    *   **Product C5** (from reactant C3): Configuration is retained as (R).\n\nCombining these assignments, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe analysis of the reaction between saturated epoxides and organocuprates, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is based on well-established principles of organic chemistry. The reaction proceeds via an SN2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of the product.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a bicyclic structure containing a cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide ring. The stereochemistry of the chiral centers is specified.\n    *   **Nucleophile**: Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), often called a Gilman reagent, serves as a source for a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**: The prompt correctly states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6 of the bicycloheptane structure.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the incoming methyl nucleophile will attack the less hindered C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity (3D Arrangement)**: The reaction is an SN2 substitution. This type of reaction is known to proceed with an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n    *   The initial configuration at the site of attack, C6, is (S).\n    *   Following the SN2 attack by the methyl group, the configuration at this carbon will be inverted to (R).\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4), which are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps of the nucleophilic attack, are retained.\n\n4.  **Product Formation**:\n    *   The attack of the methyl group on C6 breaks the C6-O bond of the epoxide.\n    *   An alkoxide intermediate is formed, with the oxygen still attached to C1.\n    *   A subsequent acidic workup (a standard procedure in such reactions) protonates the alkoxide, yielding a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n\n5.  **Structure and IUPAC Name of the Product**:\n    *   The resulting molecule is a cyclohexane ring with four methyl groups and one hydroxyl group.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (the -OH) is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n    *   The new methyl group is on the adjacent carbon, which was C6 in the starting material and is now C2.\n    *   The other original methyl groups are located at positions that correspond to the new C4 and C5.\n    *   Thus, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n    *   The stereochemistry of the final product is determined as follows:\n        *   **New C1** (from old C1): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n        *   **New C2** (from old C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n        *   **New C4** (from old C4): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n        *   **New C5** (from old C3): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\nCombining these pieces, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent. This provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate is a nucleophilic ring-opening. The user prompt and chemical principles confirm two key rules for this reaction.\n        *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n        *   **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which results in an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n2.  **Identify the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity):**\n    *   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is not substituted with a methyl group (it is bonded to a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. The nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Determine the Resulting Structure:**\n    *   The attack of the methyl group on C6 breaks the C6-O bond.\n    *   After an aqueous workup (which is standard procedure), the oxygen atom at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 remain.\n    *   A new methyl group is added at C6.\n    *   To name the final product, the ring is renumbered according to IUPAC rules for a substituted cyclohexanol. The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1.\n        *   Original C1 → New C1 (has an -OH and a -CH₃)\n        *   Original C6 → New C2 (has the newly added -CH₃)\n        *   Original C5 → New C3\n        *   Original C4 → New C4 (has a -CH₃)\n        *   Original C3 → New C5 (has a -CH₃)\n        *   Original C2 → New C6\n    *   The resulting molecule is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options B and C, which have a different substitution pattern.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations remain unchanged. The original configurations were (3R) and (4R). In the renumbered product, these correspond to C5 and C4, so the product has (4R, 5R) configurations.\n    *   The stereocenter at C1 is where the epoxide was opened to form an alcohol, but the substitution reaction does not happen at this carbon. Its configuration is retained. The original configuration was (1R), and it remains (1R) in the product.\n    *   The key change occurs at C6 (which becomes C2 in the product). The reaction is an Sₙ2 attack, which causes an inversion of configuration. The starting material has a configuration of (6S).\n    *   Inversion of the (S) configuration at this carbon results in an (R) configuration.\n    *   Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The final product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product, synthesizing the information from the provided answers and applying fundamental chemical principles.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with specific stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is `Me₂CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide, which proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\nThe problem states that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is a **quaternary** carbon because it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the other ring carbons and the epoxide oxygen.\n*   **C6** is a **tertiary** carbon because it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, two other ring carbons, and the epoxide oxygen.\n*   A tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\nThis conclusion immediately eliminates options that would result from an attack at C1. The products resulting from an attack at C1 would be `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` isomers. Therefore, options A and D are incorrect. The product must be a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` isomer, leaving us to decide between options B and C.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereoselectivity (3D Outcome)**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which has two main stereochemical consequences:\n*   **Inversion of Configuration:** The stereocenter at the site of attack (C6) undergoes an inversion.\n*   **Retention of Configuration:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) retain their original configurations.\n\nLet's map the stereochemistry from the reactant to the product:\n*   **C1:** The configuration is retained. It was **(R)** and remains **(R)**.\n*   **C3:** The configuration is retained. It was **(R)**. In the final product, this carbon is numbered C5, so its configuration is **(5R)**.\n*   **C4:** The configuration is retained. It was **(R)** and remains **(4R)**.\n*   **C6:** The configuration is inverted. It was **(S)**. This carbon becomes C2 in the final product.\n\n**4. The Critical Point: Does S Invert to R?**\n\nA common mistake is to assume that a geometric inversion of an (S) center automatically results in an (R) descriptor. The R/S descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents. We must analyze if the priorities change.\n\n*   **At reactant C6:** The substituents are -O- (epoxide), -C1- (bridgehead), -C5-, and -H. The priority order is O > C1 > C5 > H. This arrangement gives the (S) configuration.\n*   **At product C2 (from old C6):** The leaving group (-O-, priority #1) is replaced by the incoming nucleophile (-CH₃). The new substituents are -C1- (now with an -OH), -C3-, -CH₃, and -H. The new priority order is C1 > C3 > CH₃ > H.\n\nBecause the leaving group (priority #1) was replaced by a group with a lower priority (#3), the simple S→R rule does not apply. A detailed 3D analysis is required. As correctly identified by several of the more thorough candidate answers (e.g., 4, 9, 10), the geometric backside attack (inversion) combined with the change in CIP priorities results in the final stereocenter having an **(S)** descriptor.\n\n*   **Conclusion on C2:** The configuration at C6 inverts geometrically, but the resulting descriptor for C2 in the product is **(S)**.\n\n**5.

Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let's break down this name to understand its structure:\n*   **7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane:** This is the core structure. It consists of a cyclohexane ring fused with a three-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (an epoxide). The bridgehead carbons are C1 and C6. The epoxide is formed between C1 and C6.\n*   **1,3,4-trimethyl:** There are methyl groups attached to carbons 1, 3, and 4.\n*   **(1R,3R,4R,6S):** This defines the absolute stereochemistry at the chiral centers.\n\nLet's visualize the structure. We can draw the cyclohexane ring in a planar representation with wedges (up) and dashes (down) to show the stereochemistry.\n*   The bicyclo[4.1.0] system implies a cis-fusion. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing \"up\" (on a wedge).\n*   **At C1 (R):** The substituents are -O-, -C6-, -C2-, and -CH3. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C1 must also be \"up\" (wedge), cis to the epoxide.\n*   **At C6 (S):** The substituents are -O-, -C1-, -C5-, and -H. For the configuration to be S, the hydrogen atom at C6 must be \"down\" (dash), trans to the epoxide.\n*   **At C3 (R):** The substituents are -C2-, -C4-, -CH3, and -H. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C3 must be \"up\" (wedge).\n*   **At C4 (R):** The substituents are -C5-, -C3-, -CH3, and -H. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C4 must also be \"up\" (wedge).\n\n**Summary of the starting material's stereochemistry:** The epoxide ring and all three methyl groups are on the same face of the cyclohexane ring (we've defined this as \"up\" or beta).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Key Principles:**\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and attack epoxides via an Sₙ2-like mechanism. The attack occurs at the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack is a backside attack, meaning the nucleophile approaches from the side opposite the C-O bond. This results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Attack**\n\nThe epoxide is formed by carbons C1 and C6. We must determine which is less sterically hindered.\n*   **C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, C2, C6, and the epoxide oxygen. It is a **quaternary** carbon.\n*   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, C1, C5, and the epoxide oxygen. It is a **tertiary** carbon.\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻) from the cuprate will attack **C6**.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   **Attack at C6:** The C6-O bond is \"up\" (wedge). The nucleophile (Me⁻) must perform a backside attack, so it will approach from the \"down\" side (dash).\n*   **Ring Opening:** The C6-O bond breaks. The C1-O bond remains, forming a lithium alkoxide at C1. Subsequent acidic or aqueous workup protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Inversion at C6:** The starting configuration at C6 is **S**. The Sₙ2 attack causes an inversion of configuration, so the new stereocenter at this carbon will be **R**. The new methyl group will be \"down\" (alpha), and the original hydrogen at C6 will be pushed \"up\" (beta).\n*   **Stereochemistry at other centers:** The configurations at C1, C3, and C4 are not directly involved in the reaction, so their stereochemistry is retained.\n    *   C1 remains **R**.\n    *   C3 remains **R**.\n    *   C4 remains **R**.\n\n**5. Name the Final Product**\n\n*   **Structure:** The product is a cyclohexanol. The -OH group is at the original C1 position. There are methyl groups at the original C1, C3, C4 positions, and a new methyl group at the original C6 position.\n*   **IUPAC Numbering:** The carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1. We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   New C1 = Old C1\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise gives methyl groups at C1, C2(old C6), C4(old C4), and C5(old C3). The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise gives methyl groups at C1, C3(old C4), C4(old C3), and C6(old C6). The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower. So the name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   **Absolute Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **New C1 (Old C1):** Configuration is retained -> **R**.\n    *   **New C2 (Old C6):** Configuration is inverted (S -> R) -> **R**.\n    *   **New C4 (Old C4):** Configuration is retained -> **R**.\n    *   **New C5 (Old C3):** Configuration is retained -> **R**.\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\n\n*   A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur derived product matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method in organic synthesis for carbon-carbon bond formation. The reaction proceeds via an S_N2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and the stereoselectivity of the product.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The prompt states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and are highly sensitive to steric hindrance. In the starting material, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, the epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to two other ring carbons (C2, C6) and the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom and two other ring carbons (C1, C5) and the epoxide oxygen.\n    Due to the significant steric bulk of the methyl group on C1 compared to the hydrogen on C6, the incoming nucleophilic methyl group from Me2CuLi will preferentially attack the less hindered **C6**. This regioselectivity eliminates options C and D, which would result from an attack at C1.\n\n2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds through an S_N2-type mechanism. A key feature of the S_N2 reaction is the inversion of configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked by the nucleophile. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond (backside attack).\n    *   The initial configuration at the site of attack, C6, is given as **(S)**.\n    *   The S_N2 attack by the methyl nucleophile will invert this stereocenter. Therefore, the configuration of this carbon in the product will be **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenters not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming process (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their original configurations.\n\n**Determining the Product:**\n\n*   The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,**6S**)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   The nucleophilic methyl group attacks C6.\n*   The C6-O bond breaks, and after an acidic workup, the oxygen at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with methyl groups at the original positions (C1, C3, C4) and a new methyl group at C6.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature for the product, the carbon bearing the -OH group (original C1) is now C1. The carbon that was attacked (original C6) is now C2.\n*   The stereochemistry of the product will be:\n    *   C1 retains its configuration: **(1R)**\n    *   C6 inverts to become C2: (6S) → **(2R)**\n    *   C4 retains its configuration: **(4R)**\n    *   C3 retains its configuration and becomes C5: **(5R)**\n\nCombining these, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   The substrate is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 with the specified absolute configurations.\n    *   The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n    *   The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n2.  **Determine the Regiochemistry:**\n    *   The problem states that the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide is across C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. The methyl nucleophile will attack C6.\n    *   The attack breaks the C6-O bond, and the oxygen (attached to C1) is later protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Constitution of the Product:**\n    *   The reaction adds a methyl group to C6 and creates a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   The starting molecule has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The product will have an -OH and a -CH₃ on the original C1. It will have a new -CH₃ on the original C6. It will retain the original -CH₃ groups at C3 and C4.\n    *   The product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol. To name it via IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as C1. The ring is then numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   The methyl groups are at the new C1, new C2 (old C6), new C4 (old C4), and new C5 (old C3). The locants are 1, 2, 4, 5.\n    *   The product is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options A and B, which are constitutional isomers resulting from attack at the wrong carbon.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The reaction is an Sₙ2-type attack, which proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C6).\n    *   The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) **retain their absolute configuration**.\n    *   Let's map the stereocenters from the reactant to the product:\n        *   Reactant C1 (R) → Product C1 (R)\n        *   Reactant C3 (R) → Product C5 (R)\n        *   Reactant C4 (R) → Product C4 (R)\n        *   Reactant C6 (S) → Product C2 (inverted configuration)\n    *   So, the product must have the configuration (1R, 4R, 5R). This is consistent with both options C and D.\n    *   The final step is to determine the configuration at C2, which results from the inversion of C6(S). While the geometric configuration is inverted, the R/S descriptor might not flip from S to R because the priorities of the substituents change. We must analyze this carefully.\n        *   Priorities at reactant C6: O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4). The configuration is (S).\n        *   Priorities at product C2: C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n        *   The Sₙ2 reaction causes a Walden inversion, meaning the spatial arrangement of the three non-reacting groups (H, C1, C5) is inverted relative to the central carbon.\n        *   Let's analyze the consequence for the R/S descriptor. A detailed analysis shows that when the leaving group (O, priority 1) is replaced by the incoming nucleophile (Me, priority 3), and the other priorities shift, the descriptor for the inverted center remains (S).\n        *   Therefore, C6(S) becomes C2(S) after the reaction.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The product has the absolute configuration (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R).\n    *   This corresponds to the name (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to identify the product of a chemical reaction.\n# Based on the step-by-step analysis:\n# 1.

The `7-oxa` indicates that the single-atom bridge of the cyclopropane is an oxygen atom, forming an epoxide fused to the cyclohexane ring. The fusion points are C1 and C6.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configurations are given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n\nLet's visualize the structure. We can draw the cyclohexane ring with the epoxide fused to it. The stereochemistry at C1 and C6 determines that the epoxide ring is cis-fused. Let's assume the oxygen atom is on the 'up' (beta) face of the ring.\n*   At **C1**, which is `R`, the C1-O bond is 'up'. For it to be R, the methyl group at C1 must be 'down' (alpha).\n*   At **C6**, which is `S`, the C6-O bond is 'up'. For it to be S, the hydrogen atom at C6 must be 'down' (alpha).\n*   At **C3**, which is `R`, the methyl group must be 'down' (alpha).\n*   At **C4**, which is `R`, the methyl group must also be 'down' (alpha).\n\nSo, the starting epoxide has the oxygen atom on one face, and all three methyl groups are on the opposite face.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagent and Reaction Type**\n\nThe reagent is **Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate)**, a Gilman reagent.\n*   This reagent is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Regioselectivity of the Attack**\n\nThe problem states a key rule for organocuprates reacting with epoxides: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **C6** is a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom).\n*   Clearly, C6 is sterically less hindered than C1.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack by the methyl group will occur at **C6**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereoselectivity of the Attack**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via an **Sₙ2 mechanism**. The problem states: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n*   This means the nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond being broken (the backside).\n*   In our structure, the C6-O bond is on the 'up' face.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile must attack C6 from the **'down' face**.\n*   This attack breaks the C6-O bond and causes an **inversion of configuration** at C6. The hydrogen atom at C6, which was 'down', is pushed to the 'up' position. The new methyl group is added to the 'down' position.\n*   The C1-O bond also breaks (after the initial attack), and upon aqueous workup, the resulting alkoxide is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The configuration at C1 is retained.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Structure and Name of the Product**\n\nLet's summarize the resulting structure:\n*   The cyclohexane ring is opened to form a cyclohexanol.\n*   The hydroxyl group (-OH) is at the original C1 position, and its stereochemistry is retained ('up').\n*   The methyl group at the original C1 position remains 'down'.\n*   The methyl groups at C3 and C4 remain 'down'.\n*   A new methyl group is added at the original C6 position and is 'down'.\n\nNow, we must name this product according to IUPAC rules:\n*   **Parent Name:** The main functional group is the alcohol, so it is a `cyclohexanol`. The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new **C1**.\n*   **Numbering:** We number the ring to give the substituents (the four methyl groups) the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Starting from the OH-carbon as C1, numbering counter-clockwise (towards the original C6) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise would give locants {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower, so we use this numbering scheme.\n*   **Full Name (without stereochemistry):** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nWe need to determine the R/S configuration for the chiral centers in the product: C1, C2, C4, and C5.\n*   **New C1 (original C1):** The configuration is retained. It was R in the starting material. So, it is **1R**.\n*   **New C2 (original C6):** The configuration is inverted due to the Sₙ2 attack. The original configuration was S. One might assume it becomes R, but we must re-evaluate using CIP rules because the substituent priorities have changed.\n    *   At New C2, the groups are H ('up'), Me ('down'), C1, and C3.\n    *   Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H.\n    *   With the lowest priority group (H) pointing towards us ('up'), we trace the path from C1 → C3 → Me, which is clockwise. A clockwise path with the lowest priority group towards the viewer means the configuration is **S**. So, it is **2S**.\n*   **New C4 (original C4):** The configuration is retained. It was R. So, it is **4R**.\n*   **New C5 (original C3):** The configuration is retained. It was R. So, it is **5R**.\n\nCombining these, the full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Core Structure:** The `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` indicates a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring. The `7-oxa` means the single-atom bridge of the cyclopropane is an oxygen atom, which defines an epoxide fused to the cyclohexane ring at carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The given R/S configurations define the 3D structure. A detailed analysis shows:\n    *   The epoxide ring is on the α-face (pointing \"down\" relative to the plane of the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   The methyl group at C1 is on the β-face (\"up\").\n    *   The methyl group at C3 is on the α-face (\"down\").\n    *   The methyl group at C4 is on the α-face (\"down\").\n    *   The hydrogen atom at C6 is on the β-face (\"up\").\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (CH₃⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem states that organocuprates attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    *   The epoxide is formed by C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C6, C2, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and the nucleophilic attack will occur at C6.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction is an Sₙ2-type attack. The problem states that this results in an \"inversion of configuration\" at the carbon where the nucleophile adds.\n    *   The nucleophile (CH₃⁻) must attack from the side opposite to the C-O bond being broken.\n    *   The C6-O bond is on the α-face (down).\n    *   Therefore, the methyl group will attack C6 from the β-face (top).\n\n**3. Predict the Product Structure**\n\n1.  **Attack at C6:** The incoming methyl group adds to the β-face of C6. The C6-O bond breaks. This causes an inversion of configuration at C6. The original configuration of C6 was S, so the new configuration at this carbon will be R.\n2.  **Ring Opening:** The C1-O bond also breaks, and the oxygen atom remains attached to C1. After an aqueous workup (which is standard procedure), this oxygen is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The stereochemistry at C1 is not affected by the reaction, so the -OH group will be on the α-face (down), just as the oxygen atom was.\n3.  **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so they retain their original R configurations.\n\n**4. Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product**\n\n1.  **Parent Chain:** The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is assigned the lowest possible number, C1. So, the original C1 of the reactant is the new C1 of the product.\n2.  **Numbering:** We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the new C1 towards the original C6 (which is now substituted with the new methyl group) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. (The alternative numbering would give 1, 3, 4, 6, which is a higher set of locants).\n    *   New C1 ← Old C1\n    *   New C2 ← Old C6\n    *   New C4 ← Old C4\n    *   New C5 ← Old C3\n3.  **Base Name:** The product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-).\n\n**5. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nWe now assign the R/S configuration to each stereocenter in the product based on the reaction mechanism:\n*   **New C1 (from Old C1):** The configuration is retained. Old C1 was R. → **1R**.\n*   **New C2 (from Old C6):** The configuration is inverted. Old C6 was S. → **2R**.\n*   **New C4 (from Old C4):** The configuration is retained. Old C4 was R. → **4R**.\n*   **New C5 (from Old C3):** The configuration is retained. Old C3 was R. → **5R**.\n\nCombining these, the full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe reaction of saturated epoxides with organocuprates, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method in organic synthesis for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The reaction follows a set of predictable rules for regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, which can be used to determine the structure of the product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexene oxide. The bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane core indicates a cyclohexane ring fused to a three-membered ring, and the \"7-oxa\" designation confirms this is an epoxide. The stereochemistry (1R,3R,4R,6S) defines the specific three-dimensional arrangement of the substituents. Based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules, the epoxide oxygen and the methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4 are all on the same face of the cyclohexane ring (beta, or 'up').\n\n2.  **Reagent:** The reagent is Me2CuLi, lithium dimethylcuprate. In this reagent, the methyl group (Me) acts as a soft nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Regioselectivity:** The first rule provided states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate is introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the other ring carbons.\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon, bonded only to hydrogen and the other ring carbons.\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and the nucleophilic methyl group will attack this position.\n\n4.  **Stereoselectivity:** The second rule states that inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is characteristic of an S_N2-type reaction mechanism. The nucleophile attacks the carbon from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond of the epoxide (anti-attack).\n    *   In the starting material, the epoxide ring is on the beta face ('up').\n    *   The methyl nucleophile must therefore attack C6 from the alpha face ('down').\n    *   This attack breaks the C6-O bond and causes an inversion of the stereocenter at C6. The hydrogen originally at C6 (alpha) is pushed to the beta position, and the new methyl group takes the alpha position.\n    *   The C1-O bond also breaks (as part of the ring opening), and the oxygen atom is protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The stereocenter at C1 is not attacked and retains its original configuration. The resulting -OH group will be on the beta face.\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are also unaffected by the reaction and retain their configurations.\n\n### Determining the Product Structure and Name\n\nFollowing the reaction, a new product is formed:\n*   The cyclohexane ring remains.\n*   An alcohol (-OH) is formed at C1, with beta stereochemistry.\n*   A new methyl group is added at C6, with alpha stereochemistry.\n*   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 retain their positions and stereochemistry.\n\nTo name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. Numbering proceeds around the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants, which results in a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\nThe final step is to assign the absolute configuration (R/S) to each chiral center in the product:\n*   **C1:** Retains its original R configuration.\n*   **C2 (originally C6):** The starting configuration was S. The SN2 attack causes a geometric inversion. However, due to changes in substituent priorities under the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules, the final designation for this center is S. This is a known phenomenon where geometric inversion does not lead to an R/S descriptor change.\n*   **C4 (originally C4):** Retains its original R configuration.\n*   **C5 (originally C3):** Retains its original R configuration.\n\nTherefore, the final product is (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe analysis of the reaction between an epoxide and an organocuprate relies on well-established principles of organic chemistry. The reaction of an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), with an epoxide proceeds via a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) mechanism. This mechanism has specific consequences for both the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analysis of Reactants:**\n*   **Substrate:** The epoxide is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This name describes a cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide ring (forming the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane core). The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6. There are methyl substituents at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me2CuLi, a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of the nucleophilic methyl anion (Me-).\n\n**2. Regioselectivity:**\nOrganocuprates are known to attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   In the given epoxide, the two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the other ring carbons.\n*   C6 is a secondary carbon.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered **C6**.\n\n**3. Stereochemistry:**\nThe reaction proceeds through an SN2-type mechanism, which results in the inversion of configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n*   The nucleophile (Me-) attacks C6.\n*   The initial configuration at C6 is (S).\n*   Due to the inversion of configuration, the new stereocenter at this carbon in the product will be **(R)**.\n*   The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, and C4) are not involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps and thus remain unchanged as (1R, 3R, 4R).\n\n**4. Product Identification and Nomenclature:**\nThe attack of the methyl group on C6 opens the epoxide ring, and subsequent protonation (during workup) places a hydroxyl (-OH) group on C1. The resulting product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol. To name the product according to IUPAC rules:\n*   The carbon bearing the hydroxyl group receives the highest priority and is numbered C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant.\n*   The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the new C1 towards the carbon that was attacked (the original C6) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   The name is therefore **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5. Final Stereochemical Assignment:**\nCombining the stereochemical outcomes with the new IUPAC numbering:\n*   **New C1** (from original C1): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **New C2** (from original C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n*   **New C4** (from original C4): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **New C5** (from original C3): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\nThus, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe reaction involves the ring-opening of a substituted epoxide by an organocuprate, specifically a Gilman reagent (Me2CuLi). The fundamental principles governing this reaction are key to determining the correct product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a bicyclic compound where an epoxide ring is fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring.\n    *   **Reagent**: Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi). This reagent acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and, in reactions with epoxides, they attack the less sterically hindered carbon atom.\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by the oxygen atom and carbons C1 and C6 of the bicyclic system.\n    *   Carbon C1 is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group and three other carbons (C2, C5, and C6).\n    *   Carbon C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen and three other carbons (C1, C2, and C5).\n    *   Comparing the two, C6 is the less sterically hindered position. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The ring-opening of epoxides by organocuprates proceeds via an Sₙ2-type mechanism. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond (anti-attack), leading to an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n    *   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6.\n    *   This causes an inversion of the stereochemistry at C6. The starting material has a (6S) configuration. After the reaction, this center will have an (R) configuration.\n    *   The stereocenter at C1 is not involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming step with the nucleophile, so its configuration (1R) is retained.\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are also unaffected, so their configurations (3R, 4R) are retained.\n\n### Determining the Product Structure\n\n*   **Attack at C6**: The methyl group adds to C6.\n*   **Ring Opening**: The C6-O bond breaks, and the C1-O bond becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH) after an aqueous workup (which is implicit in this type of reaction).\n*   **Resulting Structure**: The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with methyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 4 from the original molecule, plus a new methyl group at the site of attack (C6).\n*   **IUPAC Naming of the Product**:\n    *   The carbon bearing the -OH group is C1.

Let's assume the plane of the cyclohexane ring is the reference.\n\n1.  Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing 'up' (beta face).\n2.  We need to place the substituents (Me on C1, H on C6, Me on C3, Me on C4) as either 'up' (beta) or 'down' (alpha) to satisfy the given R/S configurations.\n    *   **At C6 (S):** The groups are O, C1, C5, H. Priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. With the O 'up', for the configuration to be S, the H at C6 must also be 'up' (beta, syn to the epoxide).\n    *   **At C1 (R):** The groups are O, C6, C2, Me. Priorities are O > C6 > C2 > Me. With the O 'up', for the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C1 must be 'down' (alpha, anti to the epoxide).\n    *   **At C4 (R):** The groups are C3, C5, Me, H. Priorities are C3 > C5 > Me > H. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C4 must be 'up' (beta).\n    *   **At C3 (R):** The groups are C4, C2, Me, H. Priorities are C4 > C2 > Me > H. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group at C3 must be 'down' (alpha).\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n*   Epoxide oxygen: **up (beta)**\n*   C1-Methyl: **down (alpha)**\n*   C3-Methyl: **down (alpha)**\n*   C4-Methyl: **up (beta)**\n*   C6-Hydrogen: **up (beta)**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). The nucleophile is effectively a methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates attack the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at **C6**.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an **Sₙ2 mechanism**. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the leaving group (the C-O bond), resulting in an **inversion of configuration** at the center of attack.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product Structure**\n\n1.  The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6. The C6-O bond is 'up' (beta), so the attack occurs from the 'down' (alpha) side.\n2.  The C6-O bond breaks. The C1-O bond also breaks, and the oxygen atom becomes an alkoxide (O⁻), which is then protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n3.  Let's trace the stereochemistry of each part of the molecule:\n    *   **At C1:** The configuration is **retained**. The original C1-Me was 'down' (alpha), and it remains 'down'. The C1-O bond was 'up' (beta), so the new C1-OH group is 'up' (beta).\n    *   **At C6:** The configuration is **inverted**. The incoming methyl group adds from the 'down' (alpha) side. The original C6-H was 'up' (beta), and it remains 'up'.\n    *   **At C3 and C4:** These centers are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations are **retained**. C3-Me remains 'down' (alpha), and C4-Me remains 'up' (beta).\n\n**Summary of Product's Relative Stereochemistry:**\n*   C1-OH: **up (beta)**\n*   C1-Me: **down (alpha)**\n*   C3-Me: **down (alpha)**\n*   C4-Me: **up (beta)**\n*   C6-Me (newly added): **down (alpha)**\n\n**Step 4: Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product**\n\n1.  **Numbering:** The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. The -OH group gets priority, so it is on C1. We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants. The methyl groups are on C1, C3, C4, and C6 of the original ring.\n    *   Numbering C1 → C6 → C5 → C4 → C3 → C2 as the new 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 gives methyl locants of {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering C1 → C2 → C3 → C4 → C5 → C6 as the new 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 gives methyl locants of {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower than {1, 3, 4, 6}. So the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches options A and B.\n\n2.  **Assigning R/S Configuration to the Product:** We use the relative stereochemistry determined in Step 3 and the new numbering system.\n    *   New C1 is original C1.\n    *   New C2 is original C6.\n    *   New C4 is original C4.\n    *   New C5 is original C3.\n\n    Let's assign the configuration for each chiral center using wedges (up, beta) and dashes (down, alpha).\n    *   **C1:** OH (wedge), Me (dash). Priorities: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. Looking down the C1-Me bond (lowest priority, dash), the path OH → C2 → C6 is clockwise. **C1 is (R)**.\n    *   **C2 (from C6):** Me (dash), H (wedge). Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H. Looking down the C2-H bond (lowest priority, wedge), the path C1 → C3 → Me is clockwise. Since we are looking from the front, we reverse the result. Clockwise → Counter-clockwise. **C2 is (S)**.\n    *   **C4 (from C4):** Me (wedge), H (dash). Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. Looking down the C4-H bond (lowest priority, dash), the path C5 → C3 → Me is clockwise. **C4 is (R)**.\n    *   **C5 (from C3):** Me (dash), H (wedge). Priorities: C4 > C6 > Me > H. Looking down the C5-H bond (lowest priority, wedge), the path C4 → C6 → Me is counter-clockwise. Reverse the result. Counter-clockwise → Clockwise. **C5 is (R)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product has the stereochemistry **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)**.\nThe full name is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n*   **Scaffold:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` is the IUPAC name for cyclohexene oxide. It consists of a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons, which are numbered C1 and C6 according to bicyclic nomenclature.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configuration at the chiral centers is given as 1R, 3R, 4R, 6S.\n\nLet's determine the 3D structure. We can draw the molecule in a half-chair conformation, which is typical for cyclohexene derivatives. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing \"up\" (on the β face).\n*   **At C1 (must be R):** The priorities are O > C6 > C2 > CH3. For the configuration to be (R) with the oxygen \"up\", the C1-methyl group must be pointing \"down\" (on the α face).\n*   **At C6 (must be S):** The priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. For the configuration to be (S) with the oxygen \"up\", the hydrogen at C6 must also be pointing \"up\" (on the β face).\n*   **At C3 (must be R):** The priorities are C4(with Me) > C2 > CH3 > H. For the configuration to be (R), the C3-methyl group must be in an axial-like \"down\" position (α face).\n*   **At C4 (must be R):** The priorities are C3(with Me) > C5 > CH3 > H. For the configuration to be (R), the C4-methyl group must be in an equatorial-like \"up\" position (β face).\n\nSo, the starting epoxide has the following stereochemical features (visualized with the epoxide ring on the top face):\n*   Epoxide O: Up (β)\n*   C1-Me: Down (α)\n*   C3-Me: Down (α)\n*   C4-Me: Up (β)\n*   C6-H: Up (β)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me2CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. The nucleophile is a methyl anion (Me⁻), which is considered a \"soft\" nucleophile.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem states that for saturated epoxides, the organocuprate attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, O, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, O, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at **C6**.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an **SN2 mechanism**, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the center of attack. The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond. Since the C6-O bond is \"up\" (β), the methyl group will attack from the \"down\" side (α). This is known as an anti-diaxial opening.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product Structure**\n\n1.  The Me⁻ group attacks C6 from the α face (\"down\").\n2.  The C6-O bond breaks. The oxygen, which is attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide (O⁻).\n3.  A subsequent acidic workup (not explicitly shown but always implied) protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n4.  The resulting molecule is a substituted cyclohexanol. The ring will adopt a stable chair conformation.\n\nLet's track the stereochemistry of each group in the product:\n*   **At C1:** The C1-O bond becomes C1-OH. Since the oxygen was \"up\" (β), the OH group is \"up\" (β). The original C1-Me group was \"down\" (α) and remains so.\n*   **At C6:** The incoming Me group attacks from \"down\" (α). The original H at C6 was \"up\" (β) and remains so.\n*   **At C3 & C4:** The methyl groups are not involved in the reaction and retain their original stereochemistry: C3-Me is \"down\" (α) and C4-Me is \"up\" (β).\n\n**Step 4: Name the Product and Determine its Absolute Configuration**\n\nFirst, we need to number the cyclohexane ring of the product according to IUPAC rules. The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the carbon bearing the -OH group is **C1**. This corresponds to the original C1 of the epoxide.\n\nWe then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n*   Path 1 (clockwise): C1 -> orig C2 -> orig C3 -> orig C4 -> orig C5 -> orig C6. Methyl groups are at 1, 3, 4, 6.\n*   Path 2 (counter-clockwise): C1 -> orig C6 -> orig C5 -> orig C4 -> orig C3 -> orig C2. Methyl groups are at 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\nThe set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower than {1, 3, 4, 6}, so we use the counter-clockwise numbering. The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options C and D.\n\nNow, we must determine the absolute configuration (R/S) at the chiral centers (C1, C2, C4, C5) of the most stable conformer.\n\n*   **Conformational Analysis:** The anti-diaxial opening initially produces a high-energy chair conformer with the C1-OH and the new C2-Me in axial positions. The ring will flip to a more stable conformer.\n    *   Initial conformer (less stable): C1-OH (axial), C1-Me (equatorial), C2-Me (axial), C4-Me (equatorial), C5-Me (axial). (3 axial groups)\n    *   Flipped conformer (more stable): C1-OH (equatorial), C1-Me (axial), C2-Me (equatorial), C4-Me (axial), C5-Me (equatorial). (2 axial groups)\n    We will assign the R/S configuration based on this more stable flipped conformer.\n\n*   **R/S Assignment (on the stable conformer):**\n    *   **C1:** Has OH (eq, β), Me (ax, α). Priorities: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. Viewing down the C1-Me (axial) bond, the path OH → C2 → C6 is clockwise. **C1 is (R)**.\n    *   **C2 (orig C6):** Has Me (eq, α), H (ax, β). Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H. Viewing down the C2-H (axial) bond, the path C1 → C3 → Me is counter-clockwise. **C2 is (S)**.\n    *   **C4 (orig C4):** Has Me (ax, β), H (eq, α). Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. Viewing down the C4-H (equatorial) bond is tricky, but careful analysis shows the path C5 → C3 → Me is clockwise. **C4 is (R)**.\n    *   **C5 (orig C3):** Has Me (eq, α), H (ax, β). Priorities: C4 > C6 > Me > H. Viewing down the C5-H (axial) bond, the path C4 → C6 → Me is clockwise. **C5 is (R)**.\n\nCombining these results, the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires us to predict the product of a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide using an organocuprate reagent. We must apply the given rules for regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4. The absolute stereochemistry at these four chiral centers is specified.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Rules:**\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs via an Sₙ2 mechanism, leading to an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nWe must compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is part of the epoxide and is also substituted with a methyl group (from the name `1,3,4-trimethyl...`). This makes C1 a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is also part of the epoxide but has no methyl substituent. It is bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon.\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the methyl nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\n\nThe reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the site of attack.\n*   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6.\n*   The initial configuration at C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n*   The Sₙ2 attack inverts this configuration, so the new stereocenter at this position will be **(R)**.\n*   The attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1. A subsequent aqueous workup (which is standard procedure to isolate the alcohol product) protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the reaction, so their configurations remain unchanged: (1R), (3R), and (4R).\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Structure and IUPAC Name**\n\nThe reaction opens the bicyclic system to form a substituted cyclohexanol.\n*   **Structure:** The product has an -OH group at the original C1 position and a new methyl group at the original C6 position. The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are also present.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the carbon bearing the -OH group (the original C1) is designated as **C1** in the product's name.\n    2.  We must number the ring to give the substituents (the four methyl groups) the lowest possible set of locants. The methyl groups are at positions corresponding to the original C1, C3, C4, and the newly added one on C6.\n        *   **Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1:** The methyl groups are at positions 1 (on new C1), 2 (the new methyl on original C6), 4 (on original C4), and 5 (on original C3). This gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n        *   **Numbering clockwise from the new C1:** The methyl groups would be at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. This gives the locant set {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    3.  Comparing the locant sets {1, 2, 4, 5} and {1, 3, 4, 6}, the first set is lower. Thus, the correct base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n*   **Assigning Final Stereochemistry:** We use the correct (counter-clockwise) numbering to assign the stereodescriptors.\n    *   **New C1** (was original C1): Configuration is retained → **(R)**.\n    *   **New C2** (was original C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) → **(R)**.\n    *   **New C4** (was original C4): Configuration is retained → **(R)**.\n    *   **New C5** (was original C3): Configuration is retained → **(R)**.\n\nThe full and correct IUPAC name for the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our derived product name with the given options:\n*   **A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This matches our result perfectly.\n*   B) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect numbering.\n*   C) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect numbering and stereochemistry.\n*   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect stereochemistry at C2 (implies retention of configuration, which is incorrect for this mechanism).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    *   The starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n    *   `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   `7-oxa` indicates that the single-atom bridge is an oxygen atom, meaning this is an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   The substituents are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   To determine the 3D structure, we use the given stereochemistry (1R,3R,4R,6S). We can draw the molecule on a plane with wedges (up) and dashes (down) to represent its stereochemistry. A consistent assignment is:\n        *   The epoxide oxygen is on the 'up' face (beta, wedge).\n        *   The methyl group at C1 is 'down' (alpha, dash). This gives the (1R) configuration. (Priorities: O > C6 > C2 > Me).\n        *   The hydrogen at C6 is 'down' (alpha, dash). This gives the (6S) configuration. (Priorities: O > C1 > C5 > H).\n        *   The methyl group at C3 is 'down' (alpha, dash). This gives the (3R) configuration. (Priorities: C4 > C2 > Me > H).\n        *   The methyl group at C4 is 'down' (alpha, dash). This gives the (4R) configuration. (Priorities: C3 > C5 > Me > H).\n    *   So, the starting material has the epoxide ring on one face of the cyclohexane ring, and the methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are all on the opposite face.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reagent and Reaction:**\n    *   The reagent is **Me2CuLi** (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of the soft nucleophile, methyl anion (Me⁻).\n    *   The problem states two key rules for the reaction of organocuprates with epoxides:\n        1.  The alkyl group attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n        2.  The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n3.  **Determine the Site of Attack:**\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, O, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, O, and a hydrogen).\n    *   C6 is less sterically hindered than C1. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The attack is an Sₙ2 reaction. The nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack from the side opposite to the C6-O bond.\n    *   In our model, the C6-O bond is 'up'. Thus, the Me⁻ attacks C6 from the 'down' side.\n    *   This attack causes an inversion of configuration at C6. The hydrogen atom at C6, which was 'down', is pushed 'up'. The new methyl group from the cuprate is added to the 'down' position.\n    *   The C6-O bond breaks, and the oxygen atom, which is still attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide (O⁻). After acidic workup (implied), it becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH). Since the original C1-O bond was 'up', the resulting OH group at C1 will also be 'up'.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Product Structure:**\n    *   The product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n    *   The OH group is at C1 and is 'up'.\n    *   The original methyl group at C1 is 'down'.\n    *   The original methyl group at C3 is 'down'.\n    *   The original methyl group at C4 is 'down'.\n    *   The new methyl group (from Me2CuLi) is at C6 and is 'down'.\n    *   So, the final product has an 'up' OH group, and all four methyl groups are 'down' (i.e., trans to the OH group).\n\n6.  **Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product:**\n    *   First, we must number the product according to IUPAC rules. The carbon bearing the -OH group is C1. We then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   The methyl groups are at positions corresponding to the original C1, C3, C4, and C6. Numbering from the new C1 (original C1), the methyl locants are {1, 3, 4, 6}, regardless of whether we number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   *Note*: The options provide product names with locants {1, 2, 4, 5} or {2, 2, 4, 5}. This indicates a flaw in the problem statement, as the locants derived from the starting material do not match those in the options. We must assume this is a typo in the question and proceed by determining the correct stereochemistry (R/S configuration) of the product we've derived, and find the option that matches it. The most likely scenario is that the attacked carbon (original C6) becomes C2 in the product name provided in the options.\n    *   Now, we assign the R/S configuration to each chiral center of our derived product structure (OH up, all four Me down), assuming the numbering {1, 2, 4, 5} as given in options B and D.\n        *   **C1**: Has OH(up), Me(down). Priorities: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. With Me(4) pointing away (down/dash), the sequence OH(1)→C2(2)→C6(3) is clockwise. Thus, **C1 is (R)**.\n        *   **C2 (original C6)**: Has new Me(down), H(up). Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H. With H(4) pointing towards us (up/wedge), the sequence C1(1)→C3(2)→Me(3) is clockwise. Since H is towards us, we reverse the assignment. Thus, **C2 is (S)**.\n        *   **C4**: Has Me(down), H(up). Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. With H(4) pointing towards us (up/wedge), the sequence C5(1)→C3(2)→Me(3) is counter-clockwise. We reverse the assignment. Thus, **C4 is (R)**.\n        *   **C5**: Has Me(down), H(up). Priorities: C4 > C6 > Me > H. With H(4) pointing towards us (up/wedge), the sequence C4(1)→C6(2)→Me(3) is clockwise. We reverse the assignment. Thus, **C5 is (S)**.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate the C5 assignment using a chair conformation, as planar drawings can be misleading. In the most stable chair, C5-Me is axial (down) and C5-H is equatorial (up). Let's put the lowest priority group (H) in the back by rotating the molecule. This is complex. Let's re-verify the C5 R/S assignment from the options. Both B and D list C5 as (R). Let's re-calculate.\n    *   Let's use the stable chair conformation: OH(eq,up), C1-Me(ax,down), C2-Me(eq,down), C4-Me(eq,down), C5-Me(ax,down).\n        *   **C5**: Me is axial down (away). H is equatorial up (front-ish). Priorities: C4(1) > C6(2) > Me(3) > H(4). Let's put Me(3) in the back. The sequence C4(1) -> C6(2) -> H(4) is clockwise. So, **C5 is (R)**.\n    *   So the calculated stereochemistry is **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   Our calculated product stereochemistry is (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R).\n    *   This matches option B exactly.\n\nA) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect locants and stereochemistry.\nB) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - **Matches our derived stereochemistry.**\nC) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect locants and stereochemistry.\nD) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n\nDespite the inconsistency in the locant numbering between the starting material and the options, the stereochemical outcome of the reaction points unambiguously to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe reaction of an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), with an epoxide is a well-established method in organic synthesis for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The reaction follows a set of predictable rules regarding its regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, which are key to determining the final product.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. There are also methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4 with the specified R/S configurations.\n    *   **Reagent**: Me2CuLi (a Gilman reagent) provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me-).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: Organocuprates are considered \"soft\" nucleophiles. In reactions with epoxides, they preferentially attack the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide ring.\n    *   In the given epoxide, the two carbons of the ring are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The ring-opening of epoxides by organocuprates proceeds via an SN2-type mechanism. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond, resulting in an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, which has an (S) configuration in the starting material. Due to the SN2 inversion, its configuration in the product will become (R).\n    *   The C1-O bond of the epoxide opens to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The configuration at C1 is retained, so it remains (R).\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations also remain (R).\n\n**Determining the Product Structure and Name:**\n\n1.  **Structure**: The reaction adds a new methyl group to C6 and creates a hydroxyl group at C1. The product is therefore a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n\n2.  **IUPAC Naming**: To name the product, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (the -OH) is designated as C1. The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   The original C1 (now with an -OH and a methyl group) is the new C1.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2 (the newly added one), 4, and 5. The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise would give methyl groups at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is preferred as it is lower. Thus, the product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n3.  **Final Stereochemistry**:\n    *   **Product C1** (from reactant C1): Configuration is retained as (R).\n    *   **Product C2** (from reactant C6): Configuration inverts from (S) to (R).\n    *   **Product C4** (from reactant C4): Configuration is retained as (R).\n    *   **Product C5** (from reactant C3): Configuration is retained as (R).\n\nCombining these assignments, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe analysis of the reaction between saturated epoxides and organocuprates, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is based on well-established principles of organic chemistry. The reaction proceeds via an SN2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of the product.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a bicyclic structure containing a cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide ring. The stereochemistry of the chiral centers is specified.\n    *   **Nucleophile**: Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), often called a Gilman reagent, serves as a source for a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**: The prompt correctly states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6 of the bicycloheptane structure.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the incoming methyl nucleophile will attack the less hindered C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity (3D Arrangement)**: The reaction is an SN2 substitution. This type of reaction is known to proceed with an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n    *   The initial configuration at the site of attack, C6, is (S).\n    *   Following the SN2 attack by the methyl group, the configuration at this carbon will be inverted to (R).\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4), which are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps of the nucleophilic attack, are retained.\n\n4.  **Product Formation**:\n    *   The attack of the methyl group on C6 breaks the C6-O bond of the epoxide.\n    *   An alkoxide intermediate is formed, with the oxygen still attached to C1.\n    *   A subsequent acidic workup (a standard procedure in such reactions) protonates the alkoxide, yielding a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n\n5.  **Structure and IUPAC Name of the Product**:\n    *   The resulting molecule is a cyclohexane ring with four methyl groups and one hydroxyl group.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (the -OH) is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n    *   The new methyl group is on the adjacent carbon, which was C6 in the starting material and is now C2.\n    *   The other original methyl groups are located at positions that correspond to the new C4 and C5.\n    *   Thus, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n    *   The stereochemistry of the final product is determined as follows:\n        *   **New C1** (from old C1): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n        *   **New C2** (from old C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n        *   **New C4** (from old C4): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n        *   **New C5** (from old C3): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\nCombining these pieces, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent. This provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate is a nucleophilic ring-opening. The user prompt and chemical principles confirm two key rules for this reaction.\n        *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n        *   **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which results in an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n2.  **Identify the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity):**\n    *   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is not substituted with a methyl group (it is bonded to a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. The nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Determine the Resulting Structure:**\n    *   The attack of the methyl group on C6 breaks the C6-O bond.\n    *   After an aqueous workup (which is standard procedure), the oxygen atom at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 remain.\n    *   A new methyl group is added at C6.\n    *   To name the final product, the ring is renumbered according to IUPAC rules for a substituted cyclohexanol.

This eliminates options B and C, which have a different substitution pattern.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations remain unchanged. The original configurations were (3R) and (4R).

Its configuration is retained. The original configuration was (1R), and it remains (1R) in the product.\n    *   The key change occurs at C6 (which becomes C2 in the product). The reaction is an Sₙ2 attack, which causes an inversion of configuration. The starting material has a configuration of (6S).\n    *   Inversion of the (S) configuration at this carbon results in an (R) configuration.\n    *   Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The final product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
