The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening is an anti-addition, which leads to the formation of a racemic mixture of (4R, 5R)- and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two products are enantiomers.\n*   **Reaction 2:** The treatment of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA results in a syn-addition to form a racemic mixture of cis-epoxides. The subsequent acid-catalyzed anti-addition of water to this racemic mixture results in the formation of a single product: the meso compound, (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nThe final mixture, therefore, contains three stereoisomers: the (4R, 5R) enantiomer, the (4S, 5S) enantiomer, and the (4R, 5S) meso compound.\n\nThe chromatographic separation of this mixture is as follows:\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This method separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated; they will elute together as a single peak. Diastereomers, such as the enantiomeric pair and the meso compound, have different physical properties and can be separated. Thus, the racemic mixture of (4R, 5R)- and (4S, 5S)-diols will appear as one peak, and the meso-diol will appear as a second, separate peak. This results in a total of **2 peaks**.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase to separate enantiomers. The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. Therefore, the (4R, 5R)-diol and the (4S, 5S)-diol will be resolved into two separate peaks. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and appear as its own peak. This results in a total of **3 peaks**.\n\nTherefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a *trans*-alkene like (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA is a syn-addition, meaning the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond. This process occurs with equal probability from either face of the alkene, resulting in the formation of a racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides. The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, which are enantiomers of each other.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Aqueous acid workup (hydrolysis).** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide by water is an anti-addition. This means the water molecule attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   When the (4R,5R)-epoxide is attacked by water, the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at one of the two carbons, leading to the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Similarly, when the (4S,5S)-epoxide is hydrolyzed, it also yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The syn-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene like (Z)-oct-4-ene results in a *cis*-epoxide. Because the starting material is symmetrical, the resulting epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is a meso compound.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Aqueous acid workup (hydrolysis).** The subsequent acid-catalyzed anti-addition of water opens the meso-epoxide ring.\n    *   Attack of water at one carbon of the meso-epoxide results in the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon results in the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are a pair of enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is that the meso compound is a diastereomer to both of the enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Observation**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity, but they cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers, however, have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   In this case, the racemic pair of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols will co-elute as one peak. The meso-(4R,5S)-diol, being a diastereomer to the other two, will have different properties and will elute at a different time, producing a second peak.\n    *   **Observation: 2 peaks.**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound is achiral but is a diastereomer to the other two compounds. It will not be resolved further and will appear as a single, separate peak.\n    *   **Observation: 3 peaks.**\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (H₂O) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide C-O bond, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups overall.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for stereospecific addition reactions states that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-(E)-alkene results in a meso compound.\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene + anti-dihydroxylation → meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single, achiral meso compound: meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1, resulting in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for stereospecific addition reactions states that the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-(Z)-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene + anti-dihydroxylation → racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Products of Reaction 2:** A pair of enantiomers, which together form a racemic mixture.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   Compound 1 (the meso compound) is a **diastereomer** of both compound 2 and compound 3.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol (1) will be separated from the enantiomeric pair (2 and 3).\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute at the same time (co-elute).\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomers (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Since all three stereoisomers in the mixture are chemically distinct in a chiral environment, they will all be separated.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a C2 rotational axis of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process that results in anti-dihydroxylation.\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs a syn-addition epoxidation across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide via an S_N2-like attack by water, which is an anti-addition.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The combination of a syn-epoxidation followed by an anti-ring-opening is equivalent to an overall anti-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** A well-established rule in stereochemistry is that the anti-addition to a trans-alkene results in a meso compound.\n    *   Mnemonic: **T**rans + **A**nti -> **M**eso (TAM).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid produces meso-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound. Let's call this compound **M**. (Its specific configuration is (4R, 5S) or (4S, 5R), which are identical for a meso compound).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition to a cis-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Mnemonic: **C**is + **A**nti -> **R**acemic (CAR).\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid produces a racemic mixture of (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These are two distinct, chiral compounds that are enantiomers of each other. Let's call them **R** and **S**, respectively. They are produced in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **R**: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **S**: (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   **R** and **S** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **R**.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **S**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (**M** vs. **R** and **M** vs. **S**) have different physical properties and will therefore have different retention times. They will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers (**R** vs. **S**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will have the same retention time and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **two peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: The meso compound (**M**)\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomers (**R** + **S**)\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It will separate the diastereomers (**M** from **R** and **S**) and also the enantiomers (**R** from **S**).\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three distinct stereoisomers.\n    *   The chiral HPLC will show **three peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: The meso compound (**M**)\n        *   Peak 2: One enantiomer (e.g., **R**)\n        *   Peak 3: The other enantiomer (e.g., **S**)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  Correctly identify the overall reaction as an anti-dihydroxylation.\n2.  Apply the correct stereochemical rules for anti-addition to cis and trans alkenes. (Trans -> Meso, Cis -> Racemic).\n3.  Understand the composition of the final mixture (one meso compound and one pair of enantiomers).\n4.  Know the separation capabilities of both standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC. Achiral columns separate diastereomers but not enantiomers. Chiral columns separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   Reaction 1 Product: 1 compound (meso-diol)\n*   Reaction 2 Product: 2 compounds (racemic pair of enantiomeric diols)\n*   Total Mixture: 3 stereoisomers (1 meso, 2 enantiomers)\n*   Standard HPLC: Separates diastereomers -> 2 peaks (meso peak, enantiomer pair peak)\n*   Chiral HPLC: Separates all stereoisomers -> 3 peaks (meso peak, R-enantiomer peak, S-enantiomer peak)\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a C2 axis of symmetry.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                   \\ /\n                    C=C\n                   / \\\n                  H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Reaction with mCPBA.** This is an epoxidation reaction. The addition of the oxygen atom across the double bond is a *syn*-addition. When a trans-alkene undergoes syn-addition, it forms a trans-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral and the reagent (mCPBA) is also achiral, the reaction must produce either an achiral product or a racemic mixture. The product, trans-4,5-epoxyoctane, is chiral. Therefore, a racemic mixture of its two enantiomers is formed: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Step 2: Reaction with aqueous acid (H3O+).** This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons, leading to the formation of a diol. This ring-opening occurs via an *anti*-addition mechanism (the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen).\n    *   The overall transformation from alkene to diol (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: **(E)-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound** (if the substituents are the same, which they are here: propyl groups).\n    *   Let's trace the stereochemistry:\n        *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide: Attack at C4 (inversion) gives (4S,5R)-diol. Attack at C5 (inversion) gives (4R,5S)-diol. These are the same meso compound.\n        *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide: Attack at C4 (inversion) gives (4R,5S)-diol. Attack at C5 (inversion) gives (4S,5R)-diol. Again, this is the same meso compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product is formed, the meso compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                   \\ /\n                    C=C\n                   / \\\n                  H   H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Reaction with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a cis-alkene forms a cis-epoxide. The product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound.\n\n*   **Step 2: Reaction with aqueous acid (H3O+).** This is the *anti*-addition ring-opening of the meso-epoxide.\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: **(Z)-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n    *   Let's trace the stereochemistry:\n        *   Opening of the meso-epoxide (e.g., (4R,5S)-epoxide): Attack at C4 (inversion) gives (4S,5S)-diol. Attack at C5 (inversion) gives (4R,5R)-diol.\n        *   These two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the starting material (meso-epoxide) is achiral, they are formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains the products from both reactions:\n*   From Reaction 1: **meso-octane-4,5-diol** ((4R,5S)-diol)\n*   From Reaction 2: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (a racemic pair)\n\nIn total, there are three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of the (R,R)-diol.\n*   The meso-diol is also a **diastereomer** of the (S,S)-diol.\n*   The (R,R)-diol and (S,S)-diol are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column cannot distinguish between enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore have the same retention time, eluting as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by an achiral column.\n    *   Therefore, the racemic pair ((R,R)-diol + (S,S)-diol) will appear as **one peak**.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer to the other two, will have a different retention time and appear as a **second peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks in standard HPLC = 2.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Therefore, the enantiomers (R,R)-diol and (S,S)-diol will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the other two and will also be separated, appearing as a **third peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks in chiral HPLC = 3.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  Determine the stereochemical outcome of Reaction 1: the anti-dihydroxylation of (E)-oct-4-ene.\n2.  Determine the stereochemical outcome of Reaction 2: the anti-dihydroxylation of (Z)-oct-4-ene.\n3.  Identify all the stereoisomers present in the combined product mixture.\n4.  Predict the number of peaks for the mixture on an achiral HPLC column, which separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n5.  Predict the number of peaks for the mixture on a chiral HPLC column, which separates all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n\nI will now execute this plan. The reaction sequence (mCPBA followed by aqueous acid) results in the anti-dihydroxylation of the starting alkene. I can determine the products without needing a search or calculation.\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Determine Reaction Products**\n*   **Reaction 1:** Starts with (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene). Anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene results in a meso compound.\n    *   Product 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound.\n*   **Reaction 2:** Starts with (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene). Anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Product 2: A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture**\nThe final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol\n2.

The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are enantiomers of each other.\n\n**Step 4: Predict Standard (Achiral) HPLC Result**\nA standard, achiral HPLC column separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will elute at different times, appearing as separate peaks.\nTherefore, the racemic pair of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol will co-elute as one peak.

This forms a trans-epoxide. Because the attack can occur from either face of the alkene, a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is produced.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition process (specifically, an Sₙ2-type attack by water).\n    *   The attack of water on the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in the (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The attack of water on the (4S,5S)-epoxide results in the (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1.** The two products, (4R,5S) and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are actually the same molecule. This compound has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound. Thus, Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral product.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation.** The reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA is also a *syn*-addition. This forms a cis-epoxide, which is a meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening proceeds via *anti*-addition.\n    *   Attack of water at one carbon of the meso-epoxide yields (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon yields (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2.** These two products are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of enantiomers. Reaction 2 produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   The meso-diol from Reaction 1.\n*   The pair of enantiomeric diols from Reaction 2.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\nThe chemist analyzes this three-component mixture using two types of HPLC.\n\n1.  **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated; they will elute as a single peak.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard HPLC.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This method uses a chiral stationary phase, which interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The two enantiomers from Reaction 2 will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction 1 is achiral and will also be separated from the two enantiomers, eluting as its own distinct peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, and one for each of the two enantiomers.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting products is correct.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** The treatment of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA results in a syn-addition epoxidation, forming a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening is an anti-addition, which leads to the formation of a single, achiral meso-compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This overall process is known as anti-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** The treatment of (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA also undergoes syn-addition to form the corresponding cis-epoxide, which is a meso compound. The subsequent acid-catalyzed anti-addition ring-opening of this meso epoxide results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nThe combined product mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers: the meso-diol from Reaction 1, and the pair of enantiomeric diols from Reaction 2.\n\nThe chromatographic separation of this mixture is as follows:\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** An achiral stationary phase cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. However, it can separate diastereomers, which have different physical properties. In this case, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the meso compound will elute as one peak, and the two enantiomers will co-elute as a second peak. This results in a total of **two peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** A chiral stationary phase creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers. It interacts differently with each enantiomer, leading to different retention times. The column will also separate the meso compound from the enantiomers, as it is a diastereomer. Consequently, all three stereoisomers in the mixture—the meso compound, the (4R,4R)-enantiomer, and the (4S,5S)-enantiomer—will be resolved into distinct peaks. This results in a total of **three peaks**.\n\nTherefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. Starting with (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene), this syn-addition results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, the epoxidation occurs from either face of the alkene with equal probability, producing a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric *trans*-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide by water is an **anti-addition**. The water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond.\n    *   The hydrolysis of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The hydrolysis of the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, also results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a **meso compound**.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The **syn-addition** of the oxygen atom to (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) results in a *cis*-epoxide. Since (Z)-oct-4-ene has a plane of symmetry, the resulting *cis*-epoxide is a single **meso compound**: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The **anti-addition** of water to this meso epoxide can occur by attack at either of the two epoxide carbons.\n    *   Attack at one carbon results in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon results in its enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    Since the starting epoxide is achiral, the attack at either carbon is equally likely, producing a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The products are an equal mixture of two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Observation**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated by a standard column. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks will be observed.** (Peak 1: meso-diol; Peak 2: racemic pair).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer of a chiral compound.\n    *   This differential interaction allows for the separation of enantiomers. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will have different retention times and will appear as two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a unique retention time and will be separated.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks will be observed.** (One for each of the three stereoisomers in the mixture).\n\nTherefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, a *trans*-alkene. This is an achiral molecule.\n2.  **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process: epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening. This sequence results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the double bond.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemical rule for this type of reaction is: **Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound**.\n    *   The first step, epoxidation with mCPBA, is a *syn*-addition, which converts the *trans*-alkene into a racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   The second step, acid-catalyzed ring opening with water, is an Sₙ2-like attack that proceeds with inversion of configuration (*anti*-opening).\n    *   Opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Both (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) describe the same single achiral compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 1 produces only one compound.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene. This is an achiral molecule.\n2.  **Reagents:** The same *anti*-dihydroxylation sequence is performed.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemical rule is: **Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture**.\n    *   The first step, epoxidation with mCPBA, converts the *cis*-alkene into a single *meso* compound, (cis)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   The second step, *anti*-opening of this meso-epoxide with water, leads to a mixture of two enantiomers. Attack at one carbon gives (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, and attack at the other gives (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since the starting materials are achiral, the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated. The meso-diol will have a different retention time than the chiral diols.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved enantiomeric pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers.\n    *   It separates all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n    *   The meso-diol, the (4R,5R)-diol, and the (4S,5S)-diol are all stereochemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The treatment of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) with mCPBA results in a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom. This stereospecific reaction produces a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid opens the epoxide ring via an *anti*-addition of a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The ring opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Similarly, the ring opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound.\n\n**Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, the meso compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The treatment of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA also involves a *syn*-addition of oxygen. This reaction produces a cis-epoxide, which is a meso compound ((4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane) due to its internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-addition of water opens the meso-epoxide ring.\n    *   Attack at one carbon of the epoxide yields (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon yields its enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer to both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on physical properties like polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   In the mixture, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will co-elute, producing one peak. The meso-(4R,5S) compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time, producing a second peak.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns use a chiral stationary phase (CSP) that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The column will resolve the racemic mixture from Reaction 2 into two separate peaks for the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction 1 is a diastereomer to the other two compounds and will also be separated, appearing as a distinct, third peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe analysis is confirmed to be correct.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene ((E)-oct-4-ene) yields a single meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Reaction 2:** Anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene ((Z)-oct-4-ene) yields a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Combined Mixture:** The final mixture contains three stereoisomers: the meso compound and the pair of enantiomers.\n*   **Standard (Achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on physical properties. Diastereomers (like the meso compound and the enantiomers) have different properties and will separate. Enantiomers have identical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute. Therefore, we observe two peaks: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved racemic pair.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase to resolve enantiomers. It will also separate the diastereomers. Therefore, all three unique stereoisomers will be resolved, resulting in three peaks.\n\nThe conclusion is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer**: The proposed solution path is to determine the stereochemical products of each reaction, combine them, and then predict the number of peaks observed in both achiral and chiral HPLC separations.\n\nReaction 1 involves the anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene ((E)-oct-4-ene). This process is expected to yield a meso compound.\nReaction 2 involves the anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene ((Z)-oct-4-ene). This process is expected to yield a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.\n\nThe combined product mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers: the meso-diol, the (R,R)-diol, and the (S,S)-diol.\n\n*   On a standard (achiral) HPLC, diastereomers can be separated, but enantiomers cannot. The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. Thus, the meso compound will form one peak, and the unresolved enantiomers will form a second peak. This results in **2 peaks**.\n*   On a chiral HPLC, both diastereomers and enantiomers can be separated. All three distinct stereoisomers will be resolved. This results in **3 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC. My proposed next action is to verify the stereochemical outcome of this reaction sequence.\n\n**Skeptic**: The Proposer's logic is sound, but relies on a few key assumptions about the reaction's stereochemistry and the principles of chromatography. The search results confirm these assumptions.\n\n1.  **Stereochemistry of the Reaction**: The reaction sequence is an epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. This two-step process results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   **Reaction 1**: The *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *trans*-alkene ((E)-oct-4-ene) correctly yields a single meso compound.\n    *   **Reaction 2**: The *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene ((Z)-oct-4-ene) correctly yields a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.\n    The initial analysis of the products is therefore correct. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chromatographic Separation**:\n    *   **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: This technique separates molecules based on differences in physical properties like polarity. Diastereomers (like the meso compound and either of the enantiomers) have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated, eluting as a single peak. Therefore, the prediction of **2 peaks** is correct.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC**: This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. Since the chiral column can separate the two enantiomers from each other, and also separate them from their diastereomer (the meso compound), all three distinct molecules in the mixture will be resolved. Therefore, the prediction of **3 peaks** is correct.\n\nThe initial reasoning is fully supported by the search results.

The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening is an anti-addition, which leads to the formation of a racemic mixture of (4R, 5R)- and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two products are enantiomers.\n*   **Reaction 2:** The treatment of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA results in a syn-addition to form a racemic mixture of cis-epoxides. The subsequent acid-catalyzed anti-addition of water to this racemic mixture results in the formation of a single product: the meso compound, (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nThe final mixture, therefore, contains three stereoisomers: the (4R, 5R) enantiomer, the (4S, 5S) enantiomer, and the (4R, 5S) meso compound.\n\nThe chromatographic separation of this mixture is as follows:\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This method separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated; they will elute together as a single peak.

The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, which are enantiomers of each other.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Aqueous acid workup (hydrolysis).** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide by water is an anti-addition. This means the water molecule attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   When the (4R,5R)-epoxide is attacked by water, the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at one of the two carbons, leading to the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Similarly, when the (4S,5S)-epoxide is hydrolyzed, it also yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The syn-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene like (Z)-oct-4-ene results in a *cis*-epoxide. Because the starting material is symmetrical, the resulting epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is a meso compound.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Aqueous acid workup (hydrolysis).** The subsequent acid-catalyzed anti-addition of water opens the meso-epoxide ring.\n    *   Attack of water at one carbon of the meso-epoxide results in the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon results in the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are a pair of enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is that the meso compound is a diastereomer to both of the enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Observation**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity, but they cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers, however, have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   In this case, the racemic pair of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols will co-elute as one peak. The meso-(4R,5S)-diol, being a diastereomer to the other two, will have different properties and will elute at a different time, producing a second peak.\n    *   **Observation: 2 peaks.**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound is achiral but is a diastereomer to the other two compounds. It will not be resolved further and will appear as a single, separate peak.\n    *   **Observation: 3 peaks.**\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene.

Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a C2 axis of symmetry.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                   \\ /\n                    C=C\n                   / \\\n                  H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Reaction with mCPBA.** This is an epoxidation reaction. The addition of the oxygen atom across the double bond is a *syn*-addition. When a trans-alkene undergoes syn-addition, it forms a trans-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral and the reagent (mCPBA) is also achiral, the reaction must produce either an achiral product or a racemic mixture. The product, trans-4,5-epoxyoctane, is chiral. Therefore, a racemic mixture of its two enantiomers is formed: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Step 2: Reaction with aqueous acid (H3O+).** This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons, leading to the formation of a diol. This ring-opening occurs via an *anti*-addition mechanism (the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen).\n    *   The overall transformation from alkene to diol (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: **(E)-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound** (if the substituents are the same, which they are here: propyl groups).\n    *   Let's trace the stereochemistry:\n        *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide: Attack at C4 (inversion) gives (4S,5R)-diol. Attack at C5 (inversion) gives (4R,5S)-diol. These are the same meso compound.\n        *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide: Attack at C4 (inversion) gives (4R,5S)-diol. Attack at C5 (inversion) gives (4S,5R)-diol. Again, this is the same meso compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product is formed, the meso compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                   \\ /\n                    C=C\n                   / \\\n                  H   H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Reaction with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a cis-alkene forms a cis-epoxide. The product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound.\n\n*   **Step 2: Reaction with aqueous acid (H3O+).** This is the *anti*-addition ring-opening of the meso-epoxide.\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: **(Z)-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n    *   Let's trace the stereochemistry:\n        *   Opening of the meso-epoxide (e.g., (4R,5S)-epoxide): Attack at C4 (inversion) gives (4S,5S)-diol. Attack at C5 (inversion) gives (4R,5R)-diol.\n        *   These two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the starting material (meso-epoxide) is achiral, they are formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**3.

Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore have the same retention time, eluting as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by an achiral column.\n    *   Therefore, the racemic pair ((R,R)-diol + (S,S)-diol) will appear as **one peak**.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer to the other two, will have a different retention time and appear as a **second peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks in standard HPLC = 2.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Therefore, the enantiomers (R,R)-diol and (S,S)-diol will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the other two and will also be separated, appearing as a **third peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks in chiral HPLC = 3.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.

This forms a trans-epoxide. Because the attack can occur from either face of the alkene, a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is produced.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition process (specifically, an Sₙ2-type attack by water).\n    *   The attack of water on the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in the (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The attack of water on the (4S,5S)-epoxide results in the (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1.** The two products, (4R,5S) and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are actually the same molecule. This compound has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound. Thus, Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral product.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation.** The reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA is also a *syn*-addition. This forms a cis-epoxide, which is a meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening proceeds via *anti*-addition.\n    *   Attack of water at one carbon of the meso-epoxide yields (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon yields (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2.** These two products are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of enantiomers. Reaction 2 produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   The meso-diol from Reaction 1.\n*   The pair of enantiomeric diols from Reaction 2.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\nThe chemist analyzes this three-component mixture using two types of HPLC.\n\n1.  **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated; they will elute as a single peak.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard HPLC.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This method uses a chiral stationary phase, which interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The two enantiomers from Reaction 2 will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction 1 is achiral and will also be separated from the two enantiomers, eluting as its own distinct peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, and one for each of the two enantiomers.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting products is correct.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** The treatment of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA results in a syn-addition epoxidation, forming a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening is an anti-addition, which leads to the formation of a single, achiral meso-compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This overall process is known as anti-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** The treatment of (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA also undergoes syn-addition to form the corresponding cis-epoxide, which is a meso compound. The subsequent acid-catalyzed anti-addition ring-opening of this meso epoxide results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nThe combined product mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers: the meso-diol from Reaction 1, and the pair of enantiomeric diols from Reaction 2.\n\nThe chromatographic separation of this mixture is as follows:\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** An achiral stationary phase cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. However, it can separate diastereomers, which have different physical properties. In this case, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the meso compound will elute as one peak, and the two enantiomers will co-elute as a second peak. This results in a total of **two peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** A chiral stationary phase creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers. It interacts differently with each enantiomer, leading to different retention times. The column will also separate the meso compound from the enantiomers, as it is a diastereomer. Consequently, all three stereoisomers in the mixture—the meso compound, the (4R,4R)-enantiomer, and the (4S,5S)-enantiomer—will be resolved into distinct peaks. This results in a total of **three peaks**.\n\nTherefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. Starting with (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene), this syn-addition results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, the epoxidation occurs from either face of the alkene with equal probability, producing a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric *trans*-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide by water is an **anti-addition**. The water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond.\n    *   The hydrolysis of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The hydrolysis of the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, also results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a **meso compound**.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The **syn-addition** of the oxygen atom to (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) results in a *cis*-epoxide. Since (Z)-oct-4-ene has a plane of symmetry, the resulting *cis*-epoxide is a single **meso compound**: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The **anti-addition** of water to this meso epoxide can occur by attack at either of the two epoxide carbons.\n    *   Attack at one carbon results in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon results in its enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    Since the starting epoxide is achiral, the attack at either carbon is equally likely, producing a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The products are an equal mixture of two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Observation**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated by a standard column. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks will be observed.** (Peak 1: meso-diol; Peak 2: racemic pair).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer of a chiral compound.\n    *   This differential interaction allows for the separation of enantiomers. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will have different retention times and will appear as two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a unique retention time and will be separated.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks will be observed.** (One for each of the three stereoisomers in the mixture).\n\nTherefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, a *trans*-alkene. This is an achiral molecule.\n2.  **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process: epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening. This sequence results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the double bond.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemical rule for this type of reaction is: **Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound**.\n    *   The first step, epoxidation with mCPBA, is a *syn*-addition, which converts the *trans*-alkene into a racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   The second step, acid-catalyzed ring opening with water, is an Sₙ2-like attack that proceeds with inversion of configuration (*anti*-opening).\n    *   Opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Both (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) describe the same single achiral compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 1 produces only one compound.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene. This is an achiral molecule.\n2.  **Reagents:** The same *anti*-dihydroxylation sequence is performed.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemical rule is: **Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture**.\n    *   The first step, epoxidation with mCPBA, converts the *cis*-alkene into a single *meso* compound, (cis)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   The second step, *anti*-opening of this meso-epoxide with water, leads to a mixture of two enantiomers. Attack at one carbon gives (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, and attack at the other gives (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since the starting materials are achiral, the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated. The meso-diol will have a different retention time than the chiral diols.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved enantiomeric pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers.\n    *   It separates all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n    *   The meso-diol, the (4R,5R)-diol, and the (4S,5S)-diol are all stereochemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The treatment of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) with mCPBA results in a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom. This stereospecific reaction produces a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid opens the epoxide ring via an *anti*-addition of a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The ring opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Similarly, the ring opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound.\n\n**Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, the meso compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The treatment of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA also involves a *syn*-addition of oxygen. This reaction produces a cis-epoxide, which is a meso compound ((4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane) due to its internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-addition of water opens the meso-epoxide ring.\n    *   Attack at one carbon of the epoxide yields (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon yields its enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer to both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on physical properties like polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   In the mixture, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will co-elute, producing one peak. The meso-(4R,5S) compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time, producing a second peak.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns use a chiral stationary phase (CSP) that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The column will resolve the racemic mixture from Reaction 2 into two separate peaks for the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction 1 is a diastereomer to the other two compounds and will also be separated, appearing as a distinct, third peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe analysis is confirmed to be correct.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene ((E)-oct-4-ene) yields a single meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Reaction 2:** Anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene ((Z)-oct-4-ene) yields a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Combined Mixture:** The final mixture contains three stereoisomers: the meso compound and the pair of enantiomers.\n*   **Standard (Achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on physical properties. Diastereomers (like the meso compound and the enantiomers) have different properties and will separate. Enantiomers have identical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute. Therefore, we observe two peaks: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved racemic pair.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase to resolve enantiomers. It will also separate the diastereomers. Therefore, all three unique stereoisomers will be resolved, resulting in three peaks.\n\nThe conclusion is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer**: The proposed solution path is to determine the stereochemical products of each reaction, combine them, and then predict the number of peaks observed in both achiral and chiral HPLC separations.\n\nReaction 1 involves the anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene ((E)-oct-4-ene). This process is expected to yield a meso compound.\nReaction 2 involves the anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene ((Z)-oct-4-ene). This process is expected to yield a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.\n\nThe combined product mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers: the meso-diol, the (R,R)-diol, and the (S,S)-diol.\n\n*   On a standard (achiral) HPLC, diastereomers can be separated, but enantiomers cannot. The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. Thus, the meso compound will form one peak, and the unresolved enantiomers will form a second peak. This results in **2 peaks**.\n*   On a chiral HPLC, both diastereomers and enantiomers can be separated. All three distinct stereoisomers will be resolved. This results in **3 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC. My proposed next action is to verify the stereochemical outcome of this reaction sequence.\n\n**Skeptic**: The Proposer's logic is sound, but relies on a few key assumptions about the reaction's stereochemistry and the principles of chromatography. The search results confirm these assumptions.\n\n1.  **Stereochemistry of the Reaction**: The reaction sequence is an epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. This two-step process results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   **Reaction 1**: The *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *trans*-alkene ((E)-oct-4-ene) correctly yields a single meso compound.\n    *   **Reaction 2**: The *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene ((Z)-oct-4-ene) correctly yields a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.\n    The initial analysis of the products is therefore correct. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chromatographic Separation**:\n    *   **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: This technique separates molecules based on differences in physical properties like polarity. Diastereomers (like the meso compound and either of the enantiomers) have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated, eluting as a single peak. Therefore, the prediction of **2 peaks** is correct.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC**: This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. Since the chiral column can separate the two enantiomers from each other, and also separate them from their diastereomer (the meso compound), all three distinct molecules in the mixture will be resolved. Therefore, the prediction of **3 peaks** is correct.\n\nThe initial reasoning is fully supported by the search results. The debate converges.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
