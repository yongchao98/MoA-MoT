We need to find the energy and the degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) of the third excited state.\n\n**1. Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe Schrödinger equation for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be solved by separating variables in Cartesian coordinates. The potential can be written as $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$.

Degeneracy**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n$.\n\nFor the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to get $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$. Let's list the possible combinations:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n    *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — 3 states.\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n    *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) — 6 states.\n3.

This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is spherically symmetric, i.e., it depends only on the distance $r$ from the origin.\n\n2.  **Set up the Hamiltonian:**\n    In Cartesian coordinates, the radial distance squared is $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. The potential can be written as:\n    $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2$.\n    The total Hamiltonian $H$ is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies:\n    $H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + V(x, y, z)$\n    $H = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2\\right)$\n    This shows that the 3D Hamiltonian is a sum of three independent 1D harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians: $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    Since the Hamiltonian is separable, the total energy eigenvalue $E$ is the sum of the energy eigenvalues from each of the three 1D harmonic oscillators:\n    $E = E_x + E_y + E_z$.\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number.\n    Therefore, the total energy for the 3D system is:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    We can define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy formula simplifies to:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n4.  **Find the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The energy levels are determined by the value of $N$.\n    *   **Ground State (0th excited state):** $N=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $N=1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $N=2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $N=3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $N$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n    We can list all possible combinations:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) --- (3 states)\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n        *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) --- (6 states)\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        *   (1, 1, 1) --- (1 state)\n    The total number of combinations is the sum of these counts: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n    Therefore, the degeneracy of the third excited state is 10. This means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguishing 1D and 3D Oscillators:** The ground state energy for a 1D oscillator is $(\\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, while for a 3D isotropic oscillator it is $(\\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Identifying Excited States:** The ground state corresponds to $N=0$. The \"third excited state\" corresponds to $N=3$, not $n=3$.\n*   **Degeneracy Calculation:** The degeneracy for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator for a given $N$ can be calculated quickly with the formula $g(N) = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$. For $N=3$, this gives $g(3) = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$. This confirms the manual counting.\n*   **Eliminating Incorrect Options:** Options C and D present an energy formula proportional to $1/r^2$, which is characteristic of the energy for a particle in an infinite spherical well, not a harmonic oscillator. They can be dismissed immediately.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state ($N=3$) is $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy (its degeneracy) is 10.\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy eigenvalue.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Energy Eigenvalues:** The potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$ describes a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.

This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is spherically symmetric, i.e., it depends only on the distance $r$ from the origin.\n\n2.  **Set up the Hamiltonian:**\n    In Cartesian coordinates, the radial distance squared is $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. The potential can be written as:\n    $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2$.\n    The total Hamiltonian $H$ is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies:\n    $H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + V(x, y, z)$\n    $H = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2\\right)$\n    This shows that the 3D Hamiltonian is a sum of three independent 1D harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians: $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    Since the Hamiltonian is separable, the total energy eigenvalue $E$ is the sum of the energy eigenvalues from each of the three 1D harmonic oscillators:\n    $E = E_x + E_y + E_z$.\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number.\n    Therefore, the total energy for the 3D system is:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    We can define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy formula simplifies to:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n4.  **Find the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The energy levels are determined by the value of $N$.\n    *   **Ground State (0th excited state):** $N=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $N=1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $N=2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $N=3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $N$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n    We can list all possible combinations:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) --- (3 states)\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n        *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) --- (6 states)\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        *   (1, 1, 1) --- (1 state)\n    The total number of combinations is the sum of these counts: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n    Therefore, the degeneracy of the third excited state is 10. This means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguishing 1D and 3D Oscillators:** The ground state energy for a 1D oscillator is $(\\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, while for a 3D isotropic oscillator it is $(\\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Identifying Excited States:** The ground state corresponds to $N=0$. The \"third excited state\" corresponds to $N=3$, not $n=3$.\n*   **Degeneracy Calculation:** The degeneracy for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator for a given $N$ can be calculated quickly with the formula $g(N) = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$. For $N=3$, this gives $g(3) = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$. This confirms the manual counting.\n*   **Eliminating Incorrect Options:** Options C and D present an energy formula proportional to $1/r^2$, which is characteristic of the energy for a particle in an infinite spherical well, not a harmonic oscillator. They can be dismissed immediately.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state ($N=3$) is $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy (its degeneracy) is 10.\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy eigenvalue.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Energy Eigenvalues:** The potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$ describes a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.

Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nThis degeneracy can also be found by counting the number of ways the integer $n=3$ can be expressed as the sum of three non-negative integers ($n_x, n_y, n_z$):\n*   (3, 0, 0) and its 2 permutations: (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) - (3 states)\n*   (2, 1, 0) and its 5 permutations: (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) - (6 states)\n*   (1, 1, 1) - (1 state)\nThe total number of states is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$ and its degeneracy is 10.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
