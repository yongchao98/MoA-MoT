A molecule is typically chiral if it lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl compound. In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted.\n    *   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   This steric hindrance forces the two rings to be non-coplanar. The resulting molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism, which is a type of axial chirality. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This compound is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   To check for chirality, we look for a chiral center (an asymmetric carbon atom), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Since it has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule.\n    *   Therefore, this compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and also a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (6,6' and 2,2' respectively), the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as its mirror images are non-superimposable. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a carbon atom (the second carbon of the propanoate chain) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center, making the molecule optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. Because it is not bonded to four different groups and possesses a plane of symmetry, it is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism. While benzophenone is achiral, it can be used to create chiral derivatives or can crystallize in a chiral form.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. It has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which makes it an achiral molecule. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to assess whether each molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most commonly associated with the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or other elements of chirality like axial chirality, while lacking elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The single bond connecting the two phenyl rings can have restricted rotation if there are bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6'). In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups. This steric hindrance prevents the rings from rotating freely, locking them in a non-planar conformation. This phenomenon, known as atropisomerism, results in axial chirality, making the molecule and its mirror image non-superimposable. Thus, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2). It is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), a hydroxyl group (-OH), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). Since C2 is bonded to four distinct substituents, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C6H5)2C=O. The central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to two phenyl rings. It is sp2 hybridized and trigonal planar. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the trans-isomer of an alkene with the formula CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and show optical isomerism.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_optical_isomerism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four organic compounds for optical isomerism and determines the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dictionary to hold the analysis for each compound\n    analysis = {\n        \"1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\": \"Shows optical isomerism.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or from axial/planar chirality (as seen in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative where the two phenyl rings are connected by a C-C single bond. The ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality Check:** In biphenyl systems, if the ortho positions are substituted with large enough groups, free rotation around the single bond connecting the rings is prevented. This is called restricted rotation.\n    *   The substituents (-NO2 and -COOCH3) are bulky enough to hinder rotation, forcing the two phenyl rings to be non-coplanar. This creates a chiral axis along the C1-C1' bond.\n    *   We must check for elements of symmetry. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry because the substituents on each ring are not arranged symmetrically. It also lacks a center of inversion.\n    *   Due to restricted rotation and the lack of symmetry elements, the molecule is chiral. This type of stereoisomerism is known as atropisomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid). Its chemical structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** We look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral and therefore optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze benzophenone:**\n    *   **Structure:** Benzophenone is diphenyl ketone, with the structure (C6H5)-C(=O)-(C6H5).\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The molecule has no chiral centers. The central carbon is sp2 hybridized. We need to check for overall molecular symmetry.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Analyze dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** This molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has the plane of the molecule itself as a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral.\n    *   Furthermore, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. It does, however, show geometric (cis-trans) isomerism.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not. Therefore, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules, which are molecules that are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. It has two phenyl rings connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** In biphenyl compounds, if there are large, bulky groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is restricted due to steric hindrance. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   In this specific molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). This severe steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar and locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   For the molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Since each ring is asymmetrically substituted (a -NO2 group and a -COOCH3 group), the molecule as a whole is asymmetric. It is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is an ester derived from lactic acid. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The most common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group).\n    *   This carbon atom is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, so it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2CO. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp2-hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl groups), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric. It possesses a C2 axis of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. A molecule that is superimposable on its mirror image is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), which is a sufficient condition for it to be achiral. Dimethyl fumarate also possesses a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Optical isomerism in biphenyls can arise from a phenomenon called atropisomerism, which occurs when rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This restriction is typically caused by bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions are occupied by large nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups. These bulky groups prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar, leading to a stable, chiral conformation. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable, meaning they are enantiomers and the compound will exhibit optical activity.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is known as a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and will have two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), thus exhibiting optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. It does not have a carbon atom with four different substituents. The molecule itself is achiral; while it can crystallize in a chiral form, the individual molecule is not chiral in solution or gas phases. It possesses a plane of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image and therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of a butenedioic acid ester. It has a double bond and is a planar molecule. It possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry. There are no chiral centers in the molecule. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is an analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule belongs to a class of compounds called biphenyls. Biphenyls can exhibit a special type of stereoisomerism known as atropisomerism, which is due to restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation occurs when there are bulky groups at the ortho positions (the positions next to the connecting bond). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups). This significant steric hindrance prevents the two rings from rotating freely, which can lead to two different, non-superimposable mirror-image forms (enantiomers). Therefore, this compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon in the propanoate chain) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is called a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images, called enantiomers, which are optically active. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Benzophenone possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism. While individual benzophenone molecules are achiral, they can crystallize in a chiral form, but the molecule itself is not optically active in solution.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The double bond in the center of the molecule prevents free rotation. The molecule has a center of symmetry and is planar. Due to these symmetry elements, it is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. Its *cis*-isomer, dimethyl maleate, also has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n### Analysis of Optical Isomerism in the Given Compounds:\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common source of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or an axis of chirality, as seen in some substituted biphenyls (atropisomerism).\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. For a biphenyl to be chiral, there must be bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') that restrict free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. In this case, the nitro groups (-NO₂) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃) at the 6,6' and 2,2' positions, respectively, are bulky enough to prevent rotation. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as it lacks a plane of symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers (D and L forms) and is optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. It does not have a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings, making it achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule has a double bond, which restricts rotation, leading to geometrical isomerism (cis/trans). However, dimethyl fumarate itself is a symmetrical molecule. It has a center of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features that lead to chirality are:\n    1.  **Chiral Center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n    2.  **Axial Chirality:** Chirality arising from a molecule that has an axis of chirality, such as in allenes, spiranes, or atropisomers (e.g., substituted biphenyls).\n    3.  **Planar Chirality:** Chirality arising from a molecule that has a plane of chirality.\n\n    A molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it possesses an element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\n*   **Step-by-step analysis of each compound:**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system, which consists of two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond.\n        *   **Substituents:** There are bulky substituents at all four ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). Specifically, a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3) is at the 2 and 2' positions, and a nitro group (-NO2) is at the 6 and 6' positions.\n        *   **Chirality:** The steric hindrance caused by these four bulky ortho groups prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation forces the rings to be non-coplanar (twisted relative to each other). This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**.\n        *   **Symmetry Check:** In this twisted conformation, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The arrangement of substituents is asymmetric. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features that lead to chirality are the presence of a chiral center or axial/planar/helical chirality. A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls have a single bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Rotation around this single bond can be restricted if there are large, bulky groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   In this compound, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   The steric hindrance from these groups prevents the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar and restricts free rotation around the central C-C bond. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n    *   Because of this restricted rotation, the molecule is locked into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral, and its mirror image is non-superimposable. It exists as a pair of enantiomers and thus exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   This is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its chemical structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is called a chiral center or a stereocenter.\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center in a molecule makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (R- and S-forms).\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   The structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2C=O. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   The molecule does not contain any chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. It has a C2 rotational axis passing through the C=O bond. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   A molecule that is superimposable on its mirror image is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two -COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   It possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    Based on the analysis, compounds 1 (due to atropisomerism) and 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nThus, the correct option includes only compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism.\n\n**Understanding Optical Isomerism**\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (atropisomerism), which arises from restricted rotation around a single bond. A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound:**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative, meaning it consists of two phenyl rings connected by a C-C single bond.\n    *   **Substituents:** The positions ortho to the connecting single bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by large, bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n    *   **Chirality:** Due to the large size of these ortho substituents, there is significant steric hindrance that prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This locks the molecule into a non-planar conformation. The molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. As a result, its mirror image is non-superimposable. This type of chirality is known as **atropisomerism**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or the presence of an axis of chirality (as seen in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative, meaning it consists of two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Substituents:** All four positions adjacent to the linking bond (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky substituents: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The presence of these large groups at all four *ortho* positions creates significant steric hindrance. This hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them.\n    *   This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   Because the substitution pattern on each ring is asymmetric (e.g., a -COOCH3 at position 2 and a -NO2 at position 6), the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   This combination of restricted rotation and lack of symmetry results in a type of chirality known as **axial chirality**, and the resulting isomers are called **atropisomers**.\n    *   Since the molecule is chiral, it is non-superimposable on its mirror image and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is an ester derived from lactic acid. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   We need to look for a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four of these groups are different, this carbon atom is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a simple aromatic ketone with the formula (C6H5)2C=O. Two phenyl rings are attached to a carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The central carbon is sp2-hybridized (part of a double bond) and is only bonded to three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen).\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, it has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Additionally, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) is chiral due to atropisomerism.\n*   Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) is chiral due to a chiral center.\n*   Compound 3 (benzophenone) is achiral.\n*   Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) is achiral.\n\nThus, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, each compound must be analyzed for sources of chirality. Optical isomerism arises from chirality, which means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as biphenyls. Biphenyls can exhibit a special type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism if rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is hindered. For atropisomerism to lead to optical activity, two conditions must be met: the rotation around the central single bond must be restricted, and the molecule must lack a plane of symmetry. In this specific compound, all four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with bulky groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate). These bulky groups sterically hinder the free rotation around the biphenyl linkage. The substitution pattern is asymmetric, meaning the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry and is chiral. Therefore, it can be resolved into enantiomers and will show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. Optical isomerism in this type of molecule typically arises from the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the second carbon atom is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active. It exists as two optical isomers, L- and D-methyl lactate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. This molecule does not contain any chiral centers. It possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure features a carbon-carbon double bond. The two carboxylate groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. While it is a stereoisomer of dimethyl maleate (the *cis*-isomer), it is not optically active. The molecule has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) and is achiral. Therefore, it cannot show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are optically active.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers) or are diastereomers that are also chiral. A key feature for many optically active molecules is the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of optical isomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction is caused by bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups. These bulky groups prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar, leading to a twisted, stable conformation. This creates a chiral axis along the C1-C1' bond, making the molecule and its mirror image non-superimposable. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a central carbon atom (C2) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. The presence of this single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active, existing as two enantiomers (D and L forms).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. To be a chiral center, a carbon must be bonded to four *different* groups. Since it is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyls) and the two phenyl groups are identical, it does not have a chiral center. The molecule itself is achiral and therefore does not exhibit optical isomerism. While individual molecules can be twisted in a crystal lattice to form a chiral crystal, the molecule itself in a non-crystalline state is not chiral.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. It has a double bond which prevents free rotation, leading to geometric isomerism (cis/trans). However, the molecule is symmetrical. It possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry, which means it is achiral and cannot be optically active. Its stereoisomer, dimethyl maleate (the *cis*-isomer), is also achiral.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a breakdown of the optical isomerism for each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a type of atropisomer. Atropisomers are stereoisomers that result from hindered rotation around a single bond. In this biphenyl derivative, the bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') restrict the rotation around the central carbon-carbon single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This restriction prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar and locks the molecule into a specific conformation. If this conformation lacks a plane of symmetry, the molecule is chiral and will have a non-superimposable mirror image, thus exhibiting optical isomerism. The substitution pattern in dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate leads to a chiral molecule.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this compound has a stereocenter. The carbon at the second position (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center, which makes the molecule capable of existing as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This molecule is achiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry that runs through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. While individual molecules can adopt a twisted, chiral conformation in a crystal lattice, in solution, the phenyl rings can rotate freely, and the molecule is considered achiral on average. It does not have a chiral center and does not exhibit optical isomerism under normal conditions.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the C=C double bond. Due to these symmetry elements, it is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (6,6' and 2,2' respectively), the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as its mirror images are non-superimposable. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a carbon atom (the second carbon of the propanoate chain) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center, making the molecule optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. Because it is not bonded to four different groups and possesses a plane of symmetry, it is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism. While benzophenone is achiral, it can be used to create chiral derivatives or can crystallize in a chiral form.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. It has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which makes it an achiral molecule. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to assess whether each molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most commonly associated with the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or other elements of chirality like axial chirality, while lacking elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The single bond connecting the two phenyl rings can have restricted rotation if there are bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6'). In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups. This steric hindrance prevents the rings from rotating freely, locking them in a non-planar conformation. This phenomenon, known as atropisomerism, results in axial chirality, making the molecule and its mirror image non-superimposable. Thus, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2). It is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), a hydroxyl group (-OH), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). Since C2 is bonded to four distinct substituents, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C6H5)2C=O. The central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to two phenyl rings. It is sp2 hybridized and trigonal planar. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the trans-isomer of an alkene with the formula CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and show optical isomerism.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_optical_isomerism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four organic compounds for optical isomerism and determines the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dictionary to hold the analysis for each compound\n    analysis = {\n        \"1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\": \"Shows optical isomerism.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or from axial/planar chirality (as seen in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative where the two phenyl rings are connected by a C-C single bond. The ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality Check:** In biphenyl systems, if the ortho positions are substituted with large enough groups, free rotation around the single bond connecting the rings is prevented. This is called restricted rotation.\n    *   The substituents (-NO2 and -COOCH3) are bulky enough to hinder rotation, forcing the two phenyl rings to be non-coplanar. This creates a chiral axis along the C1-C1' bond.\n    *   We must check for elements of symmetry. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry because the substituents on each ring are not arranged symmetrically. It also lacks a center of inversion.\n    *   Due to restricted rotation and the lack of symmetry elements, the molecule is chiral. This type of stereoisomerism is known as atropisomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid).

Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** This molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has the plane of the molecule itself as a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral.\n    *   Furthermore, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules, which are molecules that are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. It has two phenyl rings connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** In biphenyl compounds, if there are large, bulky groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is restricted due to steric hindrance. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   In this specific molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). This severe steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar and locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   For the molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Since each ring is asymmetrically substituted (a -NO2 group and a -COOCH3 group), the molecule as a whole is asymmetric. It is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is an ester derived from lactic acid. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The most common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, so it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2CO. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp2-hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl groups), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric. It possesses a C2 axis of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. A molecule that is superimposable on its mirror image is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid.

Optical isomerism in biphenyls can arise from a phenomenon called atropisomerism, which occurs when rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This restriction is typically caused by bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions are occupied by large nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups. These bulky groups prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar, leading to a stable, chiral conformation. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable, meaning they are enantiomers and the compound will exhibit optical activity.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is known as a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and will have two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), thus exhibiting optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. It does not have a carbon atom with four different substituents. The molecule itself is achiral; while it can crystallize in a chiral form, the individual molecule is not chiral in solution or gas phases. It possesses a plane of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image and therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of a butenedioic acid ester. It has a double bond and is a planar molecule. It possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry. There are no chiral centers in the molecule. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is an analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule belongs to a class of compounds called biphenyls. Biphenyls can exhibit a special type of stereoisomerism known as atropisomerism, which is due to restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation occurs when there are bulky groups at the ortho positions (the positions next to the connecting bond). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups). This significant steric hindrance prevents the two rings from rotating freely, which can lead to two different, non-superimposable mirror-image forms (enantiomers). Therefore, this compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon in the propanoate chain) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is called a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images, called enantiomers, which are optically active. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Benzophenone possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism. While individual benzophenone molecules are achiral, they can crystallize in a chiral form, but the molecule itself is not optically active in solution.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The double bond in the center of the molecule prevents free rotation. The molecule has a center of symmetry and is planar. Due to these symmetry elements, it is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. Its *cis*-isomer, dimethyl maleate, also has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n### Analysis of Optical Isomerism in the Given Compounds:\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common source of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or an axis of chirality, as seen in some substituted biphenyls (atropisomerism).\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. For a biphenyl to be chiral, there must be bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') that restrict free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. In this case, the nitro groups (-NO₂) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃) at the 6,6' and 2,2' positions, respectively, are bulky enough to prevent rotation. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as it lacks a plane of symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers (D and L forms) and is optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. It does not have a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings, making it achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule has a double bond, which restricts rotation, leading to geometrical isomerism (cis/trans). However, dimethyl fumarate itself is a symmetrical molecule. It has a center of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism.

This restricted rotation forces the rings to be non-coplanar (twisted relative to each other). This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**.\n        *   **Symmetry Check:** In this twisted conformation, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.

A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This molecule is a substituted biphenyl.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (atropisomerism), which arises from restricted rotation around a single bond. A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound:**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative, meaning it consists of two phenyl rings connected by a C-C single bond.\n    *   **Substituents:** The positions ortho to the connecting single bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by large, bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n    *   **Chirality:** Due to the large size of these ortho substituents, there is significant steric hindrance that prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This locks the molecule into a non-planar conformation. The molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. As a result, its mirror image is non-superimposable. This type of chirality is known as **atropisomerism**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This compound is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2. It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms) and shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is not chiral. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon and oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral because it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, and it is the *trans* isomer. The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and also a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism.\n\n**Understanding Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or the presence of an axis of chirality (as seen in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative, meaning it consists of two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Substituents:** All four positions adjacent to the linking bond (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky substituents: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The presence of these large groups at all four *ortho* positions creates significant steric hindrance. This hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them.\n    *   This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   Because the substitution pattern on each ring is asymmetric (e.g., a -COOCH3 at position 2 and a -NO2 at position 6), the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   This combination of restricted rotation and lack of symmetry results in a type of chirality known as **axial chirality**, and the resulting isomers are called **atropisomers**.\n    *   Since the molecule is chiral, it is non-superimposable on its mirror image and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is an ester derived from lactic acid. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   We need to look for a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four of these groups are different, this carbon atom is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a simple aromatic ketone with the formula (C6H5)2C=O. Two phenyl rings are attached to a carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The central carbon is sp2-hybridized (part of a double bond) and is only bonded to three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen).\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, it has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Additionally, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) is chiral due to atropisomerism.\n*   Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) is chiral due to a chiral center.\n*   Compound 3 (benzophenone) is achiral.\n*   Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) is achiral.\n\nThus, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, each compound must be analyzed for sources of chirality. Optical isomerism arises from chirality, which means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as biphenyls. Biphenyls can exhibit a special type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism if rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is hindered. For atropisomerism to lead to optical activity, two conditions must be met: the rotation around the central single bond must be restricted, and the molecule must lack a plane of symmetry. In this specific compound, all four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with bulky groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate). These bulky groups sterically hinder the free rotation around the biphenyl linkage. The substitution pattern is asymmetric, meaning the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry and is chiral. Therefore, it can be resolved into enantiomers and will show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. Optical isomerism in this type of molecule typically arises from the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the second carbon atom is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active. It exists as two optical isomers, L- and D-methyl lactate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. This molecule does not contain any chiral centers. It possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure features a carbon-carbon double bond. The two carboxylate groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. While it is a stereoisomer of dimethyl maleate (the *cis*-isomer), it is not optically active. The molecule has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) and is achiral. Therefore, it cannot show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are optically active.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers) or are diastereomers that are also chiral. A key feature for many optically active molecules is the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of optical isomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction is caused by bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups. These bulky groups prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar, leading to a twisted, stable conformation. This creates a chiral axis along the C1-C1' bond, making the molecule and its mirror image non-superimposable. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a central carbon atom (C2) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. The presence of this single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active, existing as two enantiomers (D and L forms).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. To be a chiral center, a carbon must be bonded to four *different* groups. Since it is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyls) and the two phenyl groups are identical, it does not have a chiral center. The molecule itself is achiral and therefore does not exhibit optical isomerism. While individual molecules can be twisted in a crystal lattice to form a chiral crystal, the molecule itself in a non-crystalline state is not chiral.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. It has a double bond which prevents free rotation, leading to geometric isomerism (cis/trans). However, the molecule is symmetrical. It possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry, which means it is achiral and cannot be optically active. Its stereoisomer, dimethyl maleate (the *cis*-isomer), is also achiral.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a breakdown of the optical isomerism for each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a type of atropisomer. Atropisomers are stereoisomers that result from hindered rotation around a single bond. In this biphenyl derivative, the bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') restrict the rotation around the central carbon-carbon single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This restriction prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar and locks the molecule into a specific conformation. If this conformation lacks a plane of symmetry, the molecule is chiral and will have a non-superimposable mirror image, thus exhibiting optical isomerism. The substitution pattern in dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate leads to a chiral molecule.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this compound has a stereocenter. The carbon at the second position (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center, which makes the molecule capable of existing as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This molecule is achiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry that runs through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. While individual molecules can adopt a twisted, chiral conformation in a crystal lattice, in solution, the phenyl rings can rotate freely, and the molecule is considered achiral on average. It does not have a chiral center and does not exhibit optical isomerism under normal conditions.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the C=C double bond. Due to these symmetry elements, it is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
