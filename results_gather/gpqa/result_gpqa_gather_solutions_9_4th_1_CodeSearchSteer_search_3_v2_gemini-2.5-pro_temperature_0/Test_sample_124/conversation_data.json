This is the standard potential for a **three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator**. The term \"isotropic\" signifies that the potential is spherically symmetric, and the angular frequency of oscillation, $\\omega$, is the same in all three Cartesian directions (x, y, z).\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** The Hamiltonian for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates. This means the total energy is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators.\n    *   The energy of a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by the formula: $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n    *   The total energy for the 3D system is the sum of the energies for each dimension:\n        $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n        $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   By defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, the energy levels are given by the simplified formula:\n        $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Find the Energy of the Third Excited State:** The energy levels are indexed by the principal quantum number $n$, starting from the ground state at $n=0$.\n    *   **Ground State:** $n=0 \\implies E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $n=1 \\implies E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $n=2 \\implies E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $n=3 \\implies E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    The energy of the third excited state is therefore $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the same energy eigenvalue. This is equivalent to finding the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n=3$.\n    *   The general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n        $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    *   For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n        $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n    *   This can be verified by explicitly listing the combinations:\n        *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): 3 states\n        *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): 6 states\n        *   The combination (1, 1, 1): 1 state\n        *   Total degeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **System Identification:** It is crucial to recognize the potential $V(r) \\propto r^2$ as a harmonic oscillator. The energy expressions in options B and D, which are proportional to $1/r^2$, are characteristic of a different system (the infinite spherical well) and are incorrect for this problem.\n*   **State Indexing:** The ground state corresponds to the principal quantum number $n=0$. Therefore, the \"third excited state\" corresponds to $n=3$. This is a common point of error.\n*   **Degeneracy Value:** The degeneracy for the $n=3$ state is 10. The value of 3 (seen in option A) corresponds to the degeneracy of the *first* excited state ($n=1$).\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** All provided candidate answers correctly derive the physical values for energy ($\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$) and degeneracy (10). The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) arise because they were likely presented with different orderings of the options. The underlying physics calculation is unanimous and robust.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is 10.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the standard potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" signifies that the potential is spherically symmetric, meaning the angular frequency of oscillation, $\\omega$, is the same in all three Cartesian directions (x, y, z).\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** The Schrödinger equation for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates. This allows the total energy to be treated as the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators.\n    *   The energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by the formula $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n    *   The total energy for the 3D system is the sum of the energies for each dimension:\n        $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   This simplifies to $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   By defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ (where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$), the energy levels are given by the compact formula:\n        $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n3.  **Find the Energy of the Third Excited State:** The energy levels are indexed by the principal quantum number $n$, starting from the ground state.\n    *   **Ground State:** $n=0 \\implies E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $n=1 \\implies E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $n=2 \\implies E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $n=3 \\implies E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    The value of the energy for the third excited state is therefore $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the same energy eigenvalue. This is equivalent to finding the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n=3$.\n    *   The general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n        $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.\n    *   For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n        $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n    *   This can be verified by explicitly listing the combinations:\n        *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): 3 states\n        *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): 6 states\n        *   The combination (1, 1, 1): 1 state\n        *   The total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **System Identification:** It is crucial to recognize the potential $V(r) \\propto r^2$ as a harmonic oscillator. The energy expressions in options B and C, which are proportional to $1/r^2$, are characteristic of a different system (the infinite spherical well) and are incorrect for this problem.\n*   **State Indexing:** A common point of error is misidentifying the excited state. The ground state corresponds to the principal quantum number $n=0$. Therefore, the \"third excited state\" is the third level *above* the ground state, which corresponds to $n=3$.\n*   **Degeneracy Value:** The degeneracy for the third excited state ($n=3$) is 10. The value of 3, seen in option D, corresponds to the degeneracy of the *first* excited state ($n=1$) and is incorrect for this question.\n*   **Matching Both Values:** The correct answer choice must have both the correct energy value and the correct degeneracy.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis confirms that the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and its degeneracy (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.

This allows the problem to be treated as three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators.\n    *   The energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by the formula $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n    *   The total energy for the 3D system is the sum of the energies for each dimension:\n        $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   This simplifies to $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   By defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ (where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$), the energy levels are given by the compact formula:\n        $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n3.  **Find the Energy of the Third Excited State:** The energy levels are indexed by the principal quantum number $n$, starting with the ground state.\n    *   **Ground State:** $n=0 \\implies E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $n=1 \\implies E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $n=2 \\implies E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $n=3 \\implies E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    The value of the energy for the third excited state is therefore $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the same energy eigenvalue. This is equivalent to finding the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n=3$.\n    *   The general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n        $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.\n    *   For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n        $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n    *   This result can be verified by explicitly listing the combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n        *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): 3 states\n        *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): 6 states\n        *   The combination (1, 1, 1): 1 state\n        *   The total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **System Identification:** It is crucial to recognize that the potential $V(r) \\propto r^2$ is for a harmonic oscillator. The energy expressions in options A and C, which are proportional to $1/r^2$, are characteristic of a different system (the infinite spherical well) and are incorrect for this problem.\n*   **State Indexing:** A common point of error is misidentifying the excited state. The ground state corresponds to the principal quantum number $n=0$. Therefore, the \"third excited state\" is the third level *above* the ground state, which corresponds to $n=3$.\n*   **Degeneracy Calculation:** The correct degeneracy for the third excited state ($n=3$) is 10. The degeneracy of 3, listed in option B, corresponds to the *first* excited state ($n=1$).\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** All provided candidate answers correctly derive the physical values: an energy of $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and a degeneracy of 10. The discrepancy in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) is an artifact of them being presented with differently ordered options. The underlying physical reasoning is unanimous and robust.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe analysis confirms that the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and its degeneracy (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.

As correctly identified by all candidate answers, this is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is spherically symmetric, and the angular frequency of oscillation, $\\omega$, is the same for oscillations along all three Cartesian axes (x, y, z).\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues**: The Schrödinger equation for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates. This allows the system to be treated as three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators.\n    *   The energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by the formula $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n    *   The total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n        $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   This simplifies to $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   By defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ (where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$), the energy levels are given by the compact formula:\n        $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Find the Energy of the Third Excited State**: The energy levels are indexed by the principal quantum number $n$, starting from the ground state.\n    *   **Ground State**: $n=0 \\implies E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State**: $n=1 \\implies E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State**: $n=2 \\implies E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State**: $n=3 \\implies E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    The energy of the third excited state is therefore $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**: The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the same energy eigenvalue. This is equivalent to finding the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n=3$.\n    *   The general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n        $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    *   For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n        $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n    *   This can be verified by explicitly listing the combinations:\n        *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states\n        *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states\n        *   The single combination (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) — 1 state\n        *   The total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **System Identification**: The potential $V(r) \\propto r^2$ is the signature of a harmonic oscillator. The energy expressions in options B and C, which are proportional to $1/r^2$, are characteristic of a different system (an infinite spherical well) and are incorrect for this problem.\n*   **State Indexing**: It is crucial to remember that the ground state corresponds to the principal quantum number $n=0$. Therefore, the \"third excited state\" corresponds to $n=3$.\n*   **Matching Both Values**: The correct answer choice must have both the correct energy and the correct degeneracy. Option A has the correct energy but the wrong degeneracy (3 is the degeneracy for the first excited state, $n=1$). Options B and C have the wrong energy formula.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers**: All provided candidate answers correctly derive the physical values for energy ($\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$) and degeneracy (10). The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) arise because they were likely presented with different orderings of the options. The underlying physics calculation is unanimous and robust.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is 10.
