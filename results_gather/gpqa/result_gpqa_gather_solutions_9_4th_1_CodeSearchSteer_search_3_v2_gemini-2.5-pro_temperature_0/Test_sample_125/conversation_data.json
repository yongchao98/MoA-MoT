This is a chiral molecule with a single, pre-existing stereocenter at the C5 position in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the attack of the hydride on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces. This creates two possible configurations, (R) and (S), at the new C3 stereocenter. The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged.\n*   **Products:** The reaction yields two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have two stereocenters. They share the same configuration at C5 but differ at C3. By definition, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material is achiral and symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They constitute a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from achiral precursors, they are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry (its mirror image, (2S, 4R), is the same molecule). It is therefore an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed (a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will elute separately. This gives **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (different molecular formulas and connectivity) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, enabling the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The total mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct compounds. Therefore, each of the **5** unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule because it has a single, defined stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This chemical transformation creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction. The reduction of the planar ketone group can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R or S) at the new C3 stereocenter. This results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** The two products have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but differ at the other (C3). Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other are called **diastereomers**. Therefore, Reaction I produces **two** distinct diastereomeric products.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the C3 carbon.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material is achiral and symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, which means it is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The reaction produces **three** distinct stereoisomers: the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The total mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct compounds. Therefore, each of the **5** unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This result corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to logically deduce the number of products from each reaction and then determine how they would be separated by the two different types of HPLC. I will break down the problem as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I**: I will determine the stereochemical outcome of the reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This involves creating a new stereocenter in a molecule that is already chiral.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II**: I will determine the stereochemical outcome of the reduction of pentane-2,4-dione. This involves creating two new stereocenters in a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n3.  **Calculate Normal-Phase HPLC Peaks**: I will determine the number of peaks for the combined mixture on an achiral column, which separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n4.  **Calculate Chiral HPLC Peaks**: I will determine the number of peaks for the combined mixture on a chiral column, which separates all unique stereoisomers.\n5.  **Select the Final Answer**: I will match the calculated peak counts to the given options.\n\nThe python code below will walk through this logical process step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function logically determines the number of peaks in normal-phase and chiral HPLC\n    for the products of two specified organic reactions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n    # The starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, is a single enantiomer (chiral).\n    # The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter.\n    # When a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral,\n    # the two resulting products are diastereomers.\n    # Products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    products_rxn1 = 2\n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis of Reaction I\")\n    print(\"The reaction starts with a chiral molecule and creates a new stereocenter.\")\n    print(f\"Result: {products_rxn1} products are formed, which are diastereomers of each other.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n    # The starting material, pentane-2,4-dione, is achiral and symmetric.\n    # The reduction of both ketones creates two new stereocenters (at C2 and C4).\n    # This results in a pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) and a meso compound ((2R,4S)).\n    # Total unique stereoisomers = 1 (enantiomeric pair) + 1 (meso compound) = 3 unique compounds.\n    products_rxn2 = 3\n    print(\"Step 2: Analysis of Reaction II\")\n    print(\"The reaction starts with an achiral, symmetric molecule and creates two new stereocenters.\")\n    print(f\"Result: {products_rxn2} unique stereoisomers are formed (a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate Normal-Phase HPLC Peaks\n    # A normal-phase (achiral) column separates compounds with different physical properties.\n    # It can separate diastereomers but CANNOT separate enantiomers.\n    # From Reaction I: The 2 diastereomers will separate. -> 2 peaks.\n    peaks_normal_rxn1 = 2\n    # From Reaction II: The enantiomeric pair will elute together as 1 peak.

This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction. The attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces.

This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and verifying each step.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule because it has a single stereocenter at the C5 position with a defined (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This chemical transformation creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products and their Relationship:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The reduction of the planar ketone group can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R or S) at the new C3 stereocenter. This results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since these two molecules have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but differ at the other (C3), they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4.\n*   **Products and their Relationship:** Since the starting material is achiral and symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product.\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Because the reaction starts from achiral materials, they are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, which means it is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak.

This is a chiral molecule, with a single, pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5 in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH. This chemical transformation creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry**: The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The reduction of the planar ketone at C3 can occur from two different faces, creating two possible configurations at the new stereocenter (R and S). Since the starting molecule is already chiral, the two products formed are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship**: These two products are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) and a different configuration at the other (C3). By definition, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I**: This reaction produces **two** distinct chemical compounds.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: The starting compound is pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at carbons C2 and C4.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry**: Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers of the product will be formed. We must consider the stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship**: The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: This reaction produces **three** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Peak Calculation**:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are constitutionally different (different molecular formulas) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **4.

The total number of unique compounds is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC**: Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak.

This chemical transformation creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the two possible products are not mirror images of each other. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected, while the new one at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I**: These two products are **diastereomers**. Therefore, Reaction I produces **two** distinct stereoisomeric products.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the C3 carbon.\n*   **Reaction**: Both ketone groups (at C2 and C4) are reduced to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: For a symmetric, achiral starting material that forms two new stereocenters, we must consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from achiral materials, they are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: This reaction produces **three** distinct stereoisomers: the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: A normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Calculation**:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and has different physical properties, so it will be separated from the enantiomeric pair's peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different molecules (constitutional isomers) and will not have identical retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing it to separate enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Calculation**:\n    *   The total mixture contains all unique stereoisomers from both reactions.\n    *   Total unique compounds = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all five of these distinct compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC**: **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction I: Reduction of a Chiral Ketone**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n*   **Key Point:** This molecule is already chiral. It has a single, defined stereocenter at carbon C5.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a *new* stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the two possible products are not mirror images. They have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations at the new C3 center.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion:** These two products are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces **2** distinct compounds.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction II: Reduction of an Achiral, Symmetric Dione**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n*   **Key Point:** This molecule is achiral and symmetric, with a plane of symmetry through the central carbon (C3).\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketones (at C2 and C4) are reduced to alcohols, creating two new stereocenters.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** For a symmetric molecule where two new stereocenters are formed, we must check for all possibilities, including meso compounds.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from achiral materials, they are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Reaction II produces **3** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Mixture on a Normal-Phase (Achiral) HPLC Column**\n*   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The 2 products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will separate. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The 3 products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and has different physical properties, so it will be separated from the enantiomeric pair's peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (different molecular formulas) and will not have identical retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**4. Analyze the Combined Mixture on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The total mixture contains all unique stereoisomers from both reactions.\n    *   Total unique compounds = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all five of these distinct compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

This is a chiral molecule, meaning it is a single enantiomer with a defined stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH. This chemical transformation creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The reduction of the planar ketone can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R and S) at the new C3 stereocenter. This results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are stereoisomers. Since they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (S at C5) and the other being different (R/S at C3), they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at the C2 and C4 positions.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material is achiral and symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product.\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Because the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed (a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions, for a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers, which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Peak Calculation:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will be separated from them.

This is a chiral molecule with a single, defined stereocenter at the C5 position in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction. The attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces. Since the starting material is already chiral, this leads to the formation of two products that are not mirror images of each other.\n*   **Products:** The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have two stereocenters. They share the same configuration at one center (C5) but have different configurations at the other (C3). By definition, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material is achiral and symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They constitute a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry (its mirror image, (2S, 4R), is the same molecule). It is therefore an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed (a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will elute separately. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all non-identical stereoisomers. It can separate enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:** The combined mixture contains a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n    1.

Each of the **5** unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

This is a chiral molecule because it has a single stereocenter at the C5 position with a defined (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This chemical transformation creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products and their Relationship:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The reduction of the planar ketone group can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R or S) at the new C3 stereocenter. This results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since these two molecules have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but differ at the other (C3), they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione.

This reaction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4.\n*   **Products and their Relationship:** Since the starting material is achiral and symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product.\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Because the reaction starts from achiral materials, they are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, which means it is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral.

This is a chiral molecule with a single, defined stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products & Relationship**: Since a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the two resulting products are not mirror images of each other. They are diastereomers. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I**: This reaction produces **two** distinct chemical compounds (a pair of diastereomers).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products & Relationship**: For a symmetric, achiral starting material that forms two new stereocenters, we must consider all stereochemical possibilities:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: This reaction produces **three** distinct stereoisomers (the two enantiomers and the meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Count**:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (different molecular formulas and functional groups) and will not co-elute.\n    *   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Count**:\n    *   The total mixture contains all unique stereoisomers from both reactions.\n    *   Total unique compounds = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = 5.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all five of these distinct compounds.\n    *   **Total Chiral Peaks = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. Matching this result to the given options:\n\n*   **A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n*   B) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n*   C) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n*   D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single, defined stereocenter at the C5 position in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, creating two possible configurations, (R) and (S), at the new C3 stereocenter.\n*   **Products**: The reaction yields two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship**: These two products have two stereocenters. They share the same configuration at C5 but differ at C3. By definition, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I**: Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione.

This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: Since the starting material is achiral and symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They constitute a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship**: The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: Three distinct stereoisomers are formed (a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture**:\n    *   **From Reaction I**: The two products are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II**: The products are a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and has different physical properties, so it will be separated from the enantiomeric pair's peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different (constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all non-identical stereoisomers. It can separate enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture**: The combined mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = **5 unique stereoisomers**:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.

The starting material is enantiomerically pure.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction, so its (S) configuration remains unchanged. The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces, creating two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n*   **Products:** The reaction yields two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.

This reaction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, all possible stereoisomers of the product will be formed. We must analyze the stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**.

It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will have different retention times. There is no risk of accidental co-elution.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The total mixture contains 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak.

This is a chiral molecule, meaning it is a single enantiomer with a defined stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH. This chemical transformation creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The reduction of the planar ketone can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R and S) at the new C3 stereocenter. This results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are stereoisomers.

They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Because the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed (a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions, for a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers, which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Peak Calculation:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (different molecular formulas) and will not have the same retention times.\n    *   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   **Peak Calculation:**\n    *   The mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct compounds.\n    *   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
