The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is highly characteristic of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Analysis:** The presence of both a ketone and a double bond in a C₁₀H₁₄O molecule means the carbon skeleton cannot be the original tricyclic adamantane cage (which would require a formula of C₁₀H₁₂O). The adamantane must have undergone a ring-opening rearrangement to a bicyclic system. A known reaction under these conditions is a Grob fragmentation, which transforms the adamantane skeleton into a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton. The structure that perfectly fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure has the correct formula, a ketone in a six-membered ring, and an exocyclic methylene group.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone functional group to an alcohol and does not affect the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to an alcohol. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at position C7. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (Cₛ) that passes through the C3 and C7 atoms.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-3). Its chemical shift is typically in the 3.5-4.5 ppm range, which is more deshielded than the protons alpha to the ketone.\n*   **Coupling Pattern of H-3:** We must analyze the protons on the carbons adjacent to C3, which are C2 and C4.\n    *   Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are in an equivalent environment to the two protons on C4.\n    *   H-3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons. These four protons can be grouped into two sets of two equivalent protons:\n        1.  The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4). These are equivalent to each other due to the plane of symmetry. Let's say they couple to H-3 with a coupling constant J_A.\n        2.  The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4). These are also equivalent to each other. Let's say they couple to H-3 with a different coupling constant J_B.\n    *   The signal for H-3 is first split by the two equivalent axial-like protons into a **triplet** (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n    *   Each line of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent equatorial-like protons into another **triplet**.\n    *   The resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and spectroscopic data to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature. The provided data for the product (Product 1) is key:\n*   **IR Spectrum:** An absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone (C=O) functional group, likely within a six-membered ring.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The total proton count is 14 (2H + 10H + 2H), which means no protons were lost from the C₁₀H₁₄ core of adamantane. The formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The most telling signal is at **4.79 ppm (2H)**. This chemical shift is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n\nA simple rearrangement to a saturated ketone like adamantanone or protoadamantanone cannot account for the signal at 4.79 ppm. The only plausible reaction that produces a C₁₀H₁₄O product containing both a ketone and an exocyclic double bond is a **Grob fragmentation**. This reaction pathway leads to **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure perfectly matches all the provided data for Product 1.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is the reagent for a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol and does not affect the carbon-carbon double bond.\nTherefore, Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) and then dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a standard **reductive ozonolysis**, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic =CH₂ group is cleaved to form a ketone at the C7 position (and formaldehyde as a byproduct, which is removed). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\nTherefore, Product 3 is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one.\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In this molecule, the non-exchangeable proton in the most electron-poor environment is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). The electronegative oxygen atom deshields this proton significantly, typically placing its signal in the 3.5-4.5 ppm range, which is further downfield than the protons alpha to the ketone (~2.5-3.0 ppm).\n\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H-C3:**\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups, so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are chemically equivalent to the two protons on C4 with respect to H-C3.\n    *   In the stable chair-chair conformation of the bicyclic system, the two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) are equivalent to each other and will have one coupling constant (J_ax) with H-C3.\n    *   Similarly, the two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) are equivalent to each other and will have a different coupling constant (J_eq) with H-C3.\n    *   The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent axial-type protons. According to the n+1 rule (where n=2), this gives a **triplet**.\n    *   Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent equatorial-type protons (n=2), resulting in another **triplet**.\n\nThe final, observable coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton (H-C3) is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this multi-step synthesis problem by first deducing the structure of each product based on the reaction conditions and spectroscopic data provided. The key is to find a chemically plausible pathway that is consistent with all the information given.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1.**\n    The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The reaction with hot KOH is a known rearrangement. The provided spectral data for Product 1 is crucial:\n    *   IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone (C=O).\n    *   ¹H NMR shows a total of 14 protons, matching the starting material. The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n    *   The formula must be C₁₀H₁₄O. The degree of unsaturation is 4. This is perfectly satisfied by a structure that is bicyclic (2 degrees), has one ketone (1 degree), and one double bond (1 degree).\n    *   A known product from the Grob fragmentation of a 1,3-disubstituted adamantane is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure perfectly matches all the data.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2.**\n    Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol. The double bond is not affected.\n    *   Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3.**\n    Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond.\n    *   The exocyclic =CH₂ group is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at the C7 position (and formaldehyde as a byproduct). The alcohol at C3 is unaffected.\n    *   Product 3 is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n    *   **Identify the most deshielded proton:** In Product 3, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3), due to the electronegativity of the oxygen atom.\n    *   **Determine the coupling pattern:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7. The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are CH₂ groups.\n        *   H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n        *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) are equivalent to each other.\n        *   Similarly, the two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) are equivalent to each other.\n        *   Coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) splits the signal into a triplet (n+1=3).\n        *   This triplet is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2), turning each line into another triplet.\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the multi-step synthesis problem and determines the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Deduce the structure of Product 1 based on the provided data.\n    # The reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with hot KOH is a rearrangement.\n    # The spectral data (IR: 1720 cm-1 for a ketone, 1H NMR: 4.79 ppm for =CH2)\n    # strongly suggests the formation of 7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one.\n    product_1 = \"7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one\"\n\n    # Step 2: Deduce the structure of Product 2.\n    # The reaction with aluminum isopropoxide is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction.\n    # It reduces the ketone to an alcohol without affecting the double bond.\n    product_2 = \"7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol\"\n\n    # Step 3: Deduce the structure of Product 3.\n    # Ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond.

Standard elimination reactions are disfavored by Bredt's rule. The harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) are known to induce a skeletal rearrangement.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR spectrum: A characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   ¹H NMR spectrum: Signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The total proton count is 14, and the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Structural Deduction:** The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂). The IR peak confirms a ketone. A structure that fits all this data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This product is known to form from 1,3-dihaloadamantanes via a Grob fragmentation, a classic reaction for this system. This pathway is the most consistent with all the provided data.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 2.\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols while leaving carbon-carbon double bonds unaffected.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 3.\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone at C7, and formaldehyde as a byproduct (which is removed). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one), the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). Its chemical shift is typically in the 3.5-4.5 ppm range, which is more deshielded than the protons alpha to the ketone or other aliphatic protons.\n*   **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    1.  The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    2.  The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    3.  C2 and C4 are both methylene (CH₂) groups. So, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    4.  Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are in an equivalent environment to the two protons on C4.\n    5.  Within the C2 methylene group, the two protons are diastereotopic (axial-like and equatorial-like). Let's call them H2ax and H2eq. The same applies to C4 (H4ax, H4eq).\n    6.  Because of the overall symmetry, the two axial-like protons (H2ax and H4ax) are equivalent to each other. Likewise, the two equatorial-like protons (H2eq and H4eq) are equivalent to each other.\n    7.  The coupling constant between H-C3 and the two axial-like protons (J_ax) will be different from the coupling constant between H-C3 and the two equatorial-like protons (J_eq).\n    8.  Therefore, the signal for H-C3 is split by two equivalent protons (H2ax and H4ax) into a **triplet**. Each line of this triplet is then further split by the other two equivalent protons (H2eq and H4eq) into another **triplet**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The resulting coupling pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). It is a rigid, symmetric molecule.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR spectrum: 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone in a six-membered ring.\n    *   ¹H NMR spectrum: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The total proton count is 14, meaning the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** The harsh reaction conditions on this specific substrate are known to induce a Grob fragmentation. This rearrangement opens the adamantane cage. The structure that perfectly fits both the reaction type and the spectral data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. The ketone accounts for the IR peak, and the exocyclic methylene group accounts for the NMR signal at 4.79 ppm.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. The carbon-carbon double bond is not affected by these conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to an alcohol. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position (C7) and formaldehyde (which is removed during workup). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C3, C9, and C7.\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom, excluding the exchangeable alcohol proton (-OH). In this molecule, the proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded due to the electronegativity of the oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically in the 3.5-4.5 ppm range, higher than the protons alpha to the ketone or any other aliphatic protons.\n*   **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H-C3:**\n    1.  The proton H-C3 is located on the molecule's plane of symmetry.\n    2.  It is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂) groups.\n    3.  Due to the plane of symmetry, the two protons on C2 are in an equivalent environment to the two protons on C4.\n    4.  Within the C2 methylene group, the two protons are diastereotopic (one is axial-like, H2ax; one is equatorial-like, H2eq). The same is true for C4 (H4ax, H4eq).\n    5.  Because of the symmetry, H2ax is equivalent to H4ax, and H2eq is equivalent to H4eq.\n    6.  Therefore, the carbinol proton H-C3 is coupled to two different sets of equivalent protons:\n        *   A set of two equivalent axial-like protons {H2ax, H4ax}.\n        *   A set of two equivalent equatorial-like protons {H2eq, H4eq}.\n    7.  The coupling constant to the axial-like protons (J_ax) will be different from the coupling constant to the equatorial-like protons (J_eq).\n    8.  Coupling to the first set of two equivalent protons {H2ax, H4ax} splits the H-C3 signal into a **triplet** (n=2, so n+1=3).\n    9.  Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the second set of two equivalent protons {H2eq, H4eq}, also into a **triplet**.\n    10. The resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nComparing this result to the options:\nA) triplet\nB) pentet\nC) triplet of triplets\nD) doublet of triplets\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, evaluating the chemical transformations and spectroscopic data to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material & Reagents**: The reaction begins with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and uses a strong base (KOH) at high temperature (240°C).\n2.  **Spectroscopic Data for Product 1**:\n    *   **IR Spectrum**: A peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group, likely within a six-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum**: The spectrum shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n3.  **Analysis**:\n    *   The total proton count from the NMR is 14, which is the same as the starting material. This implies a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation for C₁₀H₁₄O is 4. A ketone accounts for one degree, meaning three degrees of unsaturation remain, which could be three rings (like adamantane) or two rings and one C=C double bond.\n    *   The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂). This accounts for the second degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, Product 1 must be a **bicyclic unsaturated ketone**. The adamantane cage (tricyclic) must have undergone a ring-opening rearrangement.\n4.  **Conclusion for Product 1**: The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with a strong base is known to proceed via a Grob fragmentation. This pathway leads to the formation of **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure perfectly matches all the provided data: it is a bicyclic ketone with an exocyclic methylene group and the correct formula. This line of reasoning, as seen in Answer 15, is the most consistent with the provided evidence.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis**: This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n3.  **Conclusion for Product 2**: The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis**: This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at position C7 and formaldehyde as a byproduct. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Conclusion for Product 3**: The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Structure**: Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3, C9, and C7. It exists in a stable chair-chair conformation.\n2.  **Most Deshielded Proton**: The most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the alcohol, the carbinol proton (H-C3). Its chemical shift is typically around 3.5-4.5 ppm, significantly downfield from other protons in the structure.\n3.  **Coupling Pattern of H-C3**:\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent to the two protons on C4 with respect to H-C3.\n    *   Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to two sets of two equivalent protons: the two axial-type protons {H2ax, H4ax} and the two equatorial-type protons {H2eq, H4eq}.\n    *   Coupling to the two equivalent axial protons (n=2) will split the H-C3 signal into a **triplet** (n+1=3).\n    *   Each peak of this triplet will be further split by the two equivalent equatorial protons (n=2), resulting in another **triplet**.\n    *   The final, observable pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis analysis aligns with the reasoning in candidate answers like 15 and 6 (though they may have started from different initial assumptions). Based on the most logical pathway that honors all the initial data, this is the correct conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of a multi-step organic synthesis and subsequent spectroscopic analysis. The key is to identify the most chemically plausible reaction pathway that is consistent with all the data provided.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Provided Data:** The product (Product 1) has an IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ (indicating a ketone) and a ¹H NMR spectrum with signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The total proton count is 14.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under harsh basic conditions is known to cause skeletal rearrangements, often via a Grob fragmentation. The provided spectral data is crucial. The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂). A structure that fits all the data (C₁₀H₁₄O formula, ketone, and exocyclic double bond) is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure is the only proposed intermediate that is consistent with all the initial data. Other proposed structures, like adamantanone or protoadamantanone, do not have vinylic protons and are therefore inconsistent with the NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone functional group to an alcohol and does not affect the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group, yielding **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**. This product is an alkene, which is necessary for the subsequent ozonolysis step.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone at that position (C7), with formaldehyde as a byproduct. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton)?\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). This is due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom, placing its chemical shift significantly downfield (typically 3.5-4.5 ppm) compared to other protons in the structure.\n*   **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    1.  The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7.\n    2.  The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    3.  Due to the symmetry, the coupling environment at C2 is identical to that at C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    4.  Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four protons: two on C2 and two on C4.\n    5.  In the stable chair-chair conformation, these four protons can be divided into two sets of equivalent protons: the two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) and the two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    6.  H-C3 will couple to the two equivalent axial-type protons with a large coupling constant (J_ax), splitting the signal into a **triplet**.\n    7.  H-C3 will also couple to the two equivalent equatorial-type protons with a smaller, different coupling constant (J_eq). This will split each line of the first triplet into another **triplet**.\n    8.  The resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence and identify the structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Provided Data for Product 1:**\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone (C=O).\n    *   ¹H NMR: Total integration is 14H, matching the starting material, implying a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O. The key signal is at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n*   **Analysis:** The combination of a C₁₀H₁₄O formula, a ketone group, and a C=C double bond requires the molecule to be bicyclic (DoU = 2 for rings + 1 for C=O + 1 for C=C = 4 total). The harsh reaction conditions are known to cause skeletal rearrangements of the adamantane cage.\n*   **Conclusion:** The most logical structure for Product 1 is one that fits all the data. A Grob fragmentation of the adamantane skeleton is a known reaction under these conditions, leading to **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure is a bicyclic unsaturated ketone that perfectly matches the IR peak, the molecular formula, and the crucial ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm. This approach, taken by Answer 15, is the most rigorous as it does not dismiss any of the provided experimental data. Other proposed structures, like protoadamantanone or adamantanone, are inconsistent with the ¹H NMR data.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the structure of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone functional group to an alcohol while leaving the carbon-carbon double bond unaffected.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify the structure of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis. The reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is converted into a ketone at position C7, and the other product is formaldehyde (which is removed). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 3 is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C3-OH and C7=O groups.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). Its chemical shift is typically higher (~3.5-4.5 ppm) than protons alpha to the ketone (~2.5-3.0 ppm) or other aliphatic protons.\n*   **Coupling Pattern of H-C3:** We must analyze the protons on the adjacent carbons, which are C2 and C4.\n    1.  Both C2 and C4 are methylene (CH₂) groups. Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    2.  Due to the molecule's symmetry, the coupling environment of the two protons on C2 is identical to that of the two protons on C4.\n    3.  The four neighboring protons can be grouped into two sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   Set 1: The two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   Set 2: The two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    4.  The coupling of H-C3 to the two equivalent axial-type protons (with coupling constant J_axial) will split the signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n    5.  Each line of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent equatorial-type protons (with a different coupling constant J_equatorial), resulting in another **triplet**.\n*   **Final Pattern:** The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D. The reasoning in Answer 15 is the most sound, despite selecting the wrong letter at the very end. The analysis in several other answers (e.g., 4, 6, 11) also correctly identifies the \"triplet of triplets\" pattern, although their proposed chemical pathways to the final product are less plausible.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reagents and Conditions:** The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature. Due to the rigid cage structure, a standard E2 elimination is impossible (violates Bredt's rule). These harsh conditions are known to promote skeletal rearrangements.\n2.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** The absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a ketone (C=O) functional group, likely in a six-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The total integration is 2H + 10H + 2H = 14H. This means the product has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O. The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n3.  **Reconcile the Data:** A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O has four degrees of unsaturation. The data indicates the presence of one ketone (1 degree) and one double bond (1 degree). This leaves two degrees of unsaturation, which corresponds to a **bicyclic** structure (not the original tricyclic adamantane).\n4.  **Propose a Structure:** The only structure that fits all the data (bicyclic, C₁₀H₁₄O, ketone, exocyclic alkene) is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This product can be formed from the starting material via a known rearrangement pathway called a Grob fragmentation.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone functional group to an alcohol, leaving the carbon-carbon double bond unaffected.\n3.  **Structure of Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is converted into a ketone (=O). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Structure of Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one), we need to find the most deshielded proton, excluding the exchangeable alcohol proton (-OH). The proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is directly bonded to a carbon attached to an electronegative oxygen atom. This makes it the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton, with a typical chemical shift of ~3.5-4.5 ppm. Protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8) are less deshielded (~2.5-3.0 ppm).\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H-C3:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   **Conformation:** The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system exists in a stable chair-chair conformation. The hydroxyl group at C3 will preferentially occupy the equatorial position to minimize steric hindrance, placing the H-C3 proton in the axial position.\n    *   **Neighbors:** The H-C3 proton is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (CH₂) groups.\n    *   **Coupling Constants:**\n        *   H-C3 (axial) is coupled to the two axial protons on C2 and C4. Due to symmetry, these two protons are equivalent to each other. The dihedral angle is ~180° (axial-axial), resulting in a **large** coupling constant (J_A).\n        *   H-C3 (axial) is also coupled to the two equatorial protons on C2 and C4. These two protons are also equivalent to each other by symmetry. The dihedral angle is ~60° (axial-equatorial), resulting in a **small** coupling constant (J_B).\n    *   **Resulting Pattern:** The signal for H-C3 is split by two sets of two equivalent protons with different coupling constants (J_A ≠ J_B).\n        *   The coupling to the two axial protons (with J_A) splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n        *   Each line of this triplet is then further split by the two equatorial protons (with J_B) into another **triplet**.\n    *   The final, observable pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1\n\nThe first step is to identify the structure of Product 1, which is formed from the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. We must use all the provided spectral data to deduce the correct structure.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone in a six-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  The total proton count from the NMR is 2 + 10 + 2 = 14, which means the product has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    2.  The signal at 4.79 ppm is in the vinylic region and is highly characteristic of protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n    3.  The reaction conditions (strong base, high heat) on a 1,3-dihaloadamantane are known to promote skeletal rearrangements, often via a Grob fragmentation.\n    4.  A structure that perfectly fits all these pieces of evidence is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This molecule has the correct formula (C₁₀H₁₄O), contains a ketone in a six-membered ring (consistent with the IR peak), and has an exocyclic methylene group whose two protons account for the signal at 4.79 ppm. Other proposed pathways that ignore this crucial NMR data are less likely to be correct.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for reducing aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols. The carbon-carbon double bond is not affected.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3\n\nProduct 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond and replaces it with carbonyl groups.\n*   **Transformation:** The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) at C7 is cleaved. This process converts the C7 carbon into a ketone (=O) and releases the other carbon as formaldehyde (which is removed during workup). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in Product 3.\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C3, C9, and C7. It exists in a stable dual chair conformation.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In this keto-alcohol, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group. This is the carbinol proton, **H-C3**. Its chemical shift is typically in the 3.5-4.5 ppm range, which is significantly downfield from protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8) and other aliphatic protons.\n*   **Coupling Pattern of H-C3:** We need to analyze the protons that couple to H-C3.\n    1.  H-C3 is located on the molecule's plane of symmetry.\n    2.  It is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons: C2 and C4.\n    3.  Due to the plane of symmetry, the C2 methylene group is equivalent to the C4 methylene group. Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    4.  These four protons can be divided into two sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   **Set A:** The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4). These two protons are equivalent to each other. Coupling to these two protons will split the H-C3 signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n        *   **Set B:** The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4). These two protons are also equivalent to each other. Coupling to these two protons will further split each line of the first triplet into another **triplet**.\n    5.  The coupling constants for Set A (J_axial) and Set B (J_equatorial) will be different.\n*   **Conclusion:** The signal for the most deshielded proton (H-C3) is split into a triplet by one pair of equivalent protons, and each of those lines is further split into another triplet by a second pair of equivalent protons. The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, evaluating the chemical transformations and spectroscopic data to arrive at the correct structure and its corresponding NMR signal.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Conditions:** The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, a rigid tricyclic compound. It is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature. Standard elimination (E2) and substitution (Sₙ2) reactions are sterically hindered or violate Bredt's rule. These harsh conditions are known to promote skeletal rearrangements.\n2.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** A strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a definitive indicator of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows signals at **4.79 ppm (2H)**, 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The total integration is 14 protons, meaning the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The signal at 4.79 ppm is a crucial piece of evidence; it is in the characteristic range for vinylic protons, and the integration of 2H strongly suggests an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n3.  **Deduce the Structure:** We need a structure with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O that contains a ketone and an exocyclic double bond. The degree of unsaturation for C₁₀H₁₄O is 4. The ketone accounts for one degree, and the double bond for another. This leaves two degrees of unsaturation, which must correspond to a bicyclic (two-ring) system. Therefore, the reaction must involve the opening of the adamantane (tricyclic) cage.\n    *   The structure that perfectly fits all these constraints is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure is a known product from the Grob fragmentation of a 1-bromo-3-hydroxyadamantane intermediate, which is a plausible intermediate under the reaction conditions. This pathway is the only one that is consistent with all the provided data.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Identify the Transformation:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols while leaving carbon-carbon double bonds intact.\n3.  **Deduce the Structure:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Identify the Transformation:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction. It cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at position C7. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Deduce the Structure:** Product 3 is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one), we must identify the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. The proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is directly attached to a carbon bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically in the 3.5-4.5 ppm range, which is significantly more deshielded than the protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8, ~2.5-3.0 ppm) or other aliphatic protons. Therefore, the **carbinol proton (H-C3)** is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H-C3:**\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   The proton H-C3 is on carbon C3. It is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂) groups, so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent in their coupling relationship to H-C3 as the two protons on C4.\n    *   In the stable chair-chair conformation, we can distinguish between axial-type and equatorial-type protons. The two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) are equivalent to each other and will have one coupling constant (J_A) with H-C3. The two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) are also equivalent to each other and will have a different coupling constant (J_B) with H-C3.\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) will split the H-C3 signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2), also into a **triplet**.\n    *   The resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material & Reagents:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n2.  **Spectroscopic Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone in a six-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The total integration is 2H + 10H + 2H = 14H. This means the product has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O (starting with C₁₀H₁₄Br₂, losing 2 Br and gaining 1 O).\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n3.  **Structural Deduction:**\n    *   The adamantane skeleton is tricyclic. A saturated tricyclic ketone (like adamantanone) would have a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O, which has 4 degrees of unsaturation (3 for the rings, 1 for the C=O). This matches the proton count.\n    *   However, a saturated ketone cannot have a vinylic proton signal at 4.79 ppm.\n    *   An unsaturated ketone containing both a C=O and a C=C would have 5 degrees of unsaturation, corresponding to a formula of C₁₀H₁₂O. This contradicts the 14H proton count.\n    *   The only way to reconcile all the data (14H, C=O, and C=C) is if the tricyclic adamantane cage has opened to form a **bicyclic** structure. A bicyclic structure has 2 degrees of unsaturation. Adding a C=O (1 DoU) and a C=C (1 DoU) gives a total of 4 degrees of unsaturation, which corresponds to the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n4.  **Plausible Structure:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions is known to proceed via a Grob fragmentation. This rearrangement leads to the formation of **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure perfectly matches all the provided data: it is a bicyclic ketone with an exocyclic methylene group and has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols while leaving C=C double bonds unaffected.\n3.  **Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to an alcohol. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position (C7). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through the C3-OH and C7=O groups.\n2.  **Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). This is due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the oxygen atom.\n3.  **Coupling Pattern of H-C3:** We need to analyze the protons that will split the signal of H-C3. H-C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Both C2 and C4 are methylene (CH₂) groups. So, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the coupling of H-C3 to the two protons on C2 is identical to its coupling to the two protons on C4.\n    *   Let's assume the stable chair-chair conformation. The hydroxyl group at C3 will preferentially occupy the equatorial position to minimize steric interactions, placing the H-C3 proton in the axial position.\n    *   An axial H-C3 is coupled to two equivalent axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) with a large coupling constant (J_ax, typically 10-13 Hz).\n    *   It is also coupled to two other equivalent equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) with a small coupling constant (J_eq, typically 2-5 Hz).\n4.  **Resulting Pattern:**\n    *   The coupling to the two equivalent axial-type protons (n=2) splits the H-C3 signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent equatorial-type protons (n=2) into another **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, the final observed pattern for the most deshielded proton is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer from the provided options.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\nThe first step is the most critical, as it dictates the rest of the reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh conditions known to cause skeletal rearrangements, as a simple elimination is forbidden by Bredt's rule.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ strongly indicates a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows a total of 14 protons (2H + 10H + 2H), which means the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. A key feature is the signal at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O has four degrees of unsaturation. The ketone (C=O) and the double bond (C=C) account for two degrees. Therefore, the carbon skeleton must have two rings, meaning it is bicyclic. This confirms that the tricyclic adamantane cage has undergone a ring-opening rearrangement.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** The structure must be a bicyclic ketone containing an exocyclic methylene group. The most plausible structure that fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure is a known product of the Grob fragmentation of adamantane derivatives under these conditions. This analysis, which is consistent with that in Answer 15, is the most rigorous as it uses all the provided spectral data. Many other candidate answers incorrectly dismiss the NMR data as a red herring.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone functional group to an alcohol. The carbon-carbon double bond is not affected by these reagents.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone at the C7 position (and formaldehyde as a byproduct). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one.\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In this molecule, the proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. This is due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically higher than that of protons alpha to the ketone or any other protons on the bicyclic frame.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Coupling (Splitting) Pattern:**\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7.\n    *   The carbinol proton (H-C3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Due to the symmetry, the two protons on C2 are in an equivalent environment to the two protons on C4. Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to four neighboring protons in total.\n    *   These four protons can be divided into two distinct sets based on their orientation in the chair-like rings:\n        *   **Set 1:** The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4). These are equivalent to each other by symmetry.\n        *   **Set 2:** The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4). These are also equivalent to each other by symmetry.\n    *   The coupling constant between H-C3 and the two axial-like protons (J_ax) will be different from the coupling constant between H-C3 and the two equatorial-like protons (J_eq).\n    *   The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent axial-like protons into a **triplet** (according to the n+1 rule, where n=2).\n    *   Each of the three lines of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent equatorial-like protons into another **triplet**.\n    *   The resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Analysis of Provided Data:**\n    *   The IR spectrum shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a ketone (C=O).\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a total of 14 protons (2H + 10H + 2H), which means no protons were lost from the C₁₀H₁₄ adamantane core. The formula of Product 1 is therefore C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is highly indicative of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Chemical Reaction:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with a strong base at high temperature is a known process called a Grob fragmentation. This reaction causes the rigid adamantane cage to open, leading to a bicyclic product.\n*   **Structure Identification:** The structure that fits all the evidence—the starting material, the reaction type, the formula C₁₀H₁₄O, the ketone IR peak, and the exocyclic methylene NMR signal—is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This is a known product of the alkaline-induced fragmentation of 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone functional group to an alcohol and does not affect the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone at position C7, with formaldehyde being formed as a byproduct. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton)?\n*   **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). This is due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically higher than that of protons alpha to the ketone.\n*   **Analyzing the Coupling Pattern:**\n    1.  The molecule bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one has a plane of symmetry that passes through atoms C3 and C7.\n    2.  The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (CH₂) groups.\n    3.  Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are in an equivalent environment to the two protons on C4.\n    4.  The proton H-C3 is coupled to two sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   It couples to the two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4). Coupling to these two equivalent protons splits the signal into a **triplet** (n=2, so n+1=3).\n        *   It also couples to the two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4). This coupling further splits each line of the first triplet into another **triplet**.\n    5.  The coupling constants for the axial and equatorial sets are different, resulting in a distinct pattern.\n*   **Conclusion:** The resulting coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton (H-C3) is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It is reacted with excess KOH at 240°C. The key is to interpret the provided spectral data for the resulting Product 1 correctly, as this determines the rest of the reaction sequence.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a ketone (C=O) group.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows a total of 14 protons (2H + 10H + 2H), which is the same number as in the starting material. This implies a molecular formula of C₁₀H₁₄O. A crucial signal is at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n*   **Reconciling the Data:** A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O has four degrees of unsaturation. A ketone accounts for one, and a double bond accounts for another. This leaves two degrees of unsaturation, which corresponds to a bicyclic (two-ring) structure. This means the original tricyclic adamantane cage must have opened during the reaction.\n*   **Plausible Structure:** A known reaction for 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions is a Grob fragmentation, which opens the cage. A plausible product that fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure has a bicyclic core, a ketone in one of the six-membered rings (consistent with the IR peak), and an exocyclic methylene group (consistent with the NMR signal at 4.79 ppm). This pathway, as detailed in Answer 15, is the most logical as it honors all the initial experimental data without making assumptions that the data is erroneous.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol. The double bond is not affected by this reagent.\n\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to an alcohol, yielding **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The exocyclic double bond (=CH₂) at position C7 is cleaved. The CH₂ group becomes formaldehyde (which is removed), and the C7 carbon becomes a carbonyl group (a ketone). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in Product 3.\n\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, the most deshielded proton (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton) is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group. This is the carbinol proton at position C3 (H-C3), which is deshielded by the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom.\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7. This symmetry is critical for determining the coupling pattern.\n*   **Coupling Analysis:** The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Each of these carbons (C2 and C4) is a methylene (-CH₂) group, so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are chemically equivalent to the two protons on C4.\n    *   In the stable chair-chair conformation of the bicyclic system, the four neighboring protons can be grouped into two distinct sets: two equivalent axial-type protons and two equivalent equatorial-type protons.\n    *   The coupling constant between H-C3 and the two equivalent axial-type protons (J_ax) will be different from the coupling constant to the two equivalent equatorial-type protons (J_eq).\n*   **Resulting Pattern:**\n    1.  The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent axial-type protons. According to the n+1 rule (where n=2), this gives a **triplet**.\n    2.  Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the other two equivalent equatorial-type protons, which also results in a **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, the final, observable coupling pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

It is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature. The provided data for the product (Product 1) is key:\n*   **IR Spectrum:** An absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone (C=O) functional group, likely within a six-membered ring.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The total proton count is 14 (2H + 10H + 2H), which means no protons were lost from the C₁₀H₁₄ core of adamantane. The formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The most telling signal is at **4.79 ppm (2H)**. This chemical shift is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n\nA simple rearrangement to a saturated ketone like adamantanone or protoadamantanone cannot account for the signal at 4.79 ppm. The only plausible reaction that produces a C₁₀H₁₄O product containing both a ketone and an exocyclic double bond is a **Grob fragmentation**. This reaction pathway leads to **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure perfectly matches all the provided data for Product 1.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is the reagent for a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol and does not affect the carbon-carbon double bond.\nTherefore, Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) and then dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a standard **reductive ozonolysis**, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic =CH₂ group is cleaved to form a ketone at the C7 position (and formaldehyde as a byproduct, which is removed). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\nTherefore, Product 3 is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one.\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In this molecule, the non-exchangeable proton in the most electron-poor environment is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). The electronegative oxygen atom deshields this proton significantly, typically placing its signal in the 3.5-4.5 ppm range, which is further downfield than the protons alpha to the ketone (~2.5-3.0 ppm).\n\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H-C3:**\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups, so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are chemically equivalent to the two protons on C4 with respect to H-C3.\n    *   In the stable chair-chair conformation of the bicyclic system, the two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) are equivalent to each other and will have one coupling constant (J_ax) with H-C3.\n    *   Similarly, the two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) are equivalent to each other and will have a different coupling constant (J_eq) with H-C3.\n    *   The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent axial-type protons. According to the n+1 rule (where n=2), this gives a **triplet**.\n    *   Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent equatorial-type protons (n=2), resulting in another **triplet**.\n\nThe final, observable coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton (H-C3) is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this multi-step synthesis problem by first deducing the structure of each product based on the reaction conditions and spectroscopic data provided. The key is to find a chemically plausible pathway that is consistent with all the information given.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1.**\n    The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The reaction with hot KOH is a known rearrangement. The provided spectral data for Product 1 is crucial:\n    *   IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone (C=O).\n    *   ¹H NMR shows a total of 14 protons, matching the starting material. The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n    *   The formula must be C₁₀H₁₄O. The degree of unsaturation is 4. This is perfectly satisfied by a structure that is bicyclic (2 degrees), has one ketone (1 degree), and one double bond (1 degree).\n    *   A known product from the Grob fragmentation of a 1,3-disubstituted adamantane is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure perfectly matches all the data.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2.**\n    Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol. The double bond is not affected.\n    *   Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3.**\n    Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond.\n    *   The exocyclic =CH₂ group is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at the C7 position (and formaldehyde as a byproduct).

Standard elimination reactions are disfavored by Bredt's rule. The harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) are known to induce a skeletal rearrangement.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR spectrum: A characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   ¹H NMR spectrum: Signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The total proton count is 14, and the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Structural Deduction:** The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂). The IR peak confirms a ketone. A structure that fits all this data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This product is known to form from 1,3-dihaloadamantanes via a Grob fragmentation, a classic reaction for this system. This pathway is the most consistent with all the provided data.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 2.\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols while leaving carbon-carbon double bonds unaffected.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 3.\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone at C7, and formaldehyde as a byproduct (which is removed). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one), the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). Its chemical shift is typically in the 3.5-4.5 ppm range, which is more deshielded than the protons alpha to the ketone or other aliphatic protons.\n*   **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    1.  The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    2.  The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    3.  C2 and C4 are both methylene (CH₂) groups. So, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    4.  Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are in an equivalent environment to the two protons on C4.\n    5.  Within the C2 methylene group, the two protons are diastereotopic (axial-like and equatorial-like). Let's call them H2ax and H2eq. The same applies to C4 (H4ax, H4eq).\n    6.  Because of the overall symmetry, the two axial-like protons (H2ax and H4ax) are equivalent to each other. Likewise, the two equatorial-like protons (H2eq and H4eq) are equivalent to each other.\n    7.  The coupling constant between H-C3 and the two axial-like protons (J_ax) will be different from the coupling constant between H-C3 and the two equatorial-like protons (J_eq).\n    8.  Therefore, the signal for H-C3 is split by two equivalent protons (H2ax and H4ax) into a **triplet**. Each line of this triplet is then further split by the other two equivalent protons (H2eq and H4eq) into another **triplet**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The resulting coupling pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). It is a rigid, symmetric molecule.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR spectrum: 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone in a six-membered ring.\n    *   ¹H NMR spectrum: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The total proton count is 14, meaning the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** The harsh reaction conditions on this specific substrate are known to induce a Grob fragmentation. This rearrangement opens the adamantane cage. The structure that perfectly fits both the reaction type and the spectral data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. The ketone accounts for the IR peak, and the exocyclic methylene group accounts for the NMR signal at 4.79 ppm.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. The carbon-carbon double bond is not affected by these conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to an alcohol. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position (C7) and formaldehyde (which is removed during workup). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C3, C9, and C7.\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom, excluding the exchangeable alcohol proton (-OH). In this molecule, the proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded due to the electronegativity of the oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically in the 3.5-4.5 ppm range, higher than the protons alpha to the ketone or any other aliphatic protons.\n*   **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H-C3:**\n    1.  The proton H-C3 is located on the molecule's plane of symmetry.\n    2.  It is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂) groups.\n    3.  Due to the plane of symmetry, the two protons on C2 are in an equivalent environment to the two protons on C4.\n    4.  Within the C2 methylene group, the two protons are diastereotopic (one is axial-like, H2ax; one is equatorial-like, H2eq). The same is true for C4 (H4ax, H4eq).\n    5.  Because of the symmetry, H2ax is equivalent to H4ax, and H2eq is equivalent to H4eq.\n    6.  Therefore, the carbinol proton H-C3 is coupled to two different sets of equivalent protons:\n        *   A set of two equivalent axial-like protons {H2ax, H4ax}.\n        *   A set of two equivalent equatorial-like protons {H2eq, H4eq}.\n    7.  The coupling constant to the axial-like protons (J_ax) will be different from the coupling constant to the equatorial-like protons (J_eq).\n    8.  Coupling to the first set of two equivalent protons {H2ax, H4ax} splits the H-C3 signal into a **triplet** (n=2, so n+1=3).\n    9.  Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the second set of two equivalent protons {H2eq, H4eq}, also into a **triplet**.\n    10. The resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nComparing this result to the options:\nA) triplet\nB) pentet\nC) triplet of triplets\nD) doublet of triplets\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, evaluating the chemical transformations and spectroscopic data to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material & Reagents**: The reaction begins with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and uses a strong base (KOH) at high temperature (240°C).\n2.  **Spectroscopic Data for Product 1**:\n    *   **IR Spectrum**: A peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group, likely within a six-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum**: The spectrum shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n3.  **Analysis**:\n    *   The total proton count from the NMR is 14, which is the same as the starting material. This implies a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation for C₁₀H₁₄O is 4. A ketone accounts for one degree, meaning three degrees of unsaturation remain, which could be three rings (like adamantane) or two rings and one C=C double bond.\n    *   The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂). This accounts for the second degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, Product 1 must be a **bicyclic unsaturated ketone**. The adamantane cage (tricyclic) must have undergone a ring-opening rearrangement.\n4.  **Conclusion for Product 1**: The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with a strong base is known to proceed via a Grob fragmentation. This pathway leads to the formation of **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure perfectly matches all the provided data: it is a bicyclic ketone with an exocyclic methylene group and the correct formula. This line of reasoning, as seen in Answer 15, is the most consistent with the provided evidence.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis**: This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n3.  **Conclusion for Product 2**: The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis**: This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at position C7 and formaldehyde as a byproduct. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Conclusion for Product 3**: The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Structure**: Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3, C9, and C7. It exists in a stable chair-chair conformation.\n2.  **Most Deshielded Proton**: The most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the alcohol, the carbinol proton (H-C3). Its chemical shift is typically around 3.5-4.5 ppm, significantly downfield from other protons in the structure.\n3.  **Coupling Pattern of H-C3**:\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent to the two protons on C4 with respect to H-C3.\n    *   Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to two sets of two equivalent protons: the two axial-type protons {H2ax, H4ax} and the two equatorial-type protons {H2eq, H4eq}.\n    *   Coupling to the two equivalent axial protons (n=2) will split the H-C3 signal into a **triplet** (n+1=3).\n    *   Each peak of this triplet will be further split by the two equivalent equatorial protons (n=2), resulting in another **triplet**.\n    *   The final, observable pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis analysis aligns with the reasoning in candidate answers like 15 and 6 (though they may have started from different initial assumptions). Based on the most logical pathway that honors all the initial data, this is the correct conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of a multi-step organic synthesis and subsequent spectroscopic analysis. The key is to identify the most chemically plausible reaction pathway that is consistent with all the data provided.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Provided Data:** The product (Product 1) has an IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ (indicating a ketone) and a ¹H NMR spectrum with signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The total proton count is 14.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under harsh basic conditions is known to cause skeletal rearrangements, often via a Grob fragmentation. The provided spectral data is crucial. The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂). A structure that fits all the data (C₁₀H₁₄O formula, ketone, and exocyclic double bond) is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure is the only proposed intermediate that is consistent with all the initial data. Other proposed structures, like adamantanone or protoadamantanone, do not have vinylic protons and are therefore inconsistent with the NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone functional group to an alcohol and does not affect the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group, yielding **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**. This product is an alkene, which is necessary for the subsequent ozonolysis step.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone at that position (C7), with formaldehyde as a byproduct. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton)?\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). This is due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom, placing its chemical shift significantly downfield (typically 3.5-4.5 ppm) compared to other protons in the structure.\n*   **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    1.  The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7.\n    2.  The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    3.  Due to the symmetry, the coupling environment at C2 is identical to that at C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    4.  Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four protons: two on C2 and two on C4.\n    5.  In the stable chair-chair conformation, these four protons can be divided into two sets of equivalent protons: the two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) and the two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    6.  H-C3 will couple to the two equivalent axial-type protons with a large coupling constant (J_ax), splitting the signal into a **triplet**.\n    7.  H-C3 will also couple to the two equivalent equatorial-type protons with a smaller, different coupling constant (J_eq). This will split each line of the first triplet into another **triplet**.\n    8.  The resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence and identify the structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Provided Data for Product 1:**\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone (C=O).\n    *   ¹H NMR: Total integration is 14H, matching the starting material, implying a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O. The key signal is at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n*   **Analysis:** The combination of a C₁₀H₁₄O formula, a ketone group, and a C=C double bond requires the molecule to be bicyclic (DoU = 2 for rings + 1 for C=O + 1 for C=C = 4 total). The harsh reaction conditions are known to cause skeletal rearrangements of the adamantane cage.\n*   **Conclusion:** The most logical structure for Product 1 is one that fits all the data. A Grob fragmentation of the adamantane skeleton is a known reaction under these conditions, leading to **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure is a bicyclic unsaturated ketone that perfectly matches the IR peak, the molecular formula, and the crucial ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm. This approach, taken by Answer 15, is the most rigorous as it does not dismiss any of the provided experimental data. Other proposed structures, like protoadamantanone or adamantanone, are inconsistent with the ¹H NMR data.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the structure of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone functional group to an alcohol while leaving the carbon-carbon double bond unaffected.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify the structure of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis. The reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is converted into a ketone at position C7, and the other product is formaldehyde (which is removed). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 3 is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C3-OH and C7=O groups.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). Its chemical shift is typically higher (~3.5-4.5 ppm) than protons alpha to the ketone (~2.5-3.0 ppm) or other aliphatic protons.\n*   **Coupling Pattern of H-C3:** We must analyze the protons on the adjacent carbons, which are C2 and C4.\n    1.  Both C2 and C4 are methylene (CH₂) groups. Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    2.  Due to the molecule's symmetry, the coupling environment of the two protons on C2 is identical to that of the two protons on C4.\n    3.  The four neighboring protons can be grouped into two sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   Set 1: The two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   Set 2: The two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    4.  The coupling of H-C3 to the two equivalent axial-type protons (with coupling constant J_axial) will split the signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n    5.  Each line of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent equatorial-type protons (with a different coupling constant J_equatorial), resulting in another **triplet**.\n*   **Final Pattern:** The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D. The reasoning in Answer 15 is the most sound, despite selecting the wrong letter at the very end. The analysis in several other answers (e.g., 4, 6, 11) also correctly identifies the \"triplet of triplets\" pattern, although their proposed chemical pathways to the final product are less plausible.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reagents and Conditions:** The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature. Due to the rigid cage structure, a standard E2 elimination is impossible (violates Bredt's rule). These harsh conditions are known to promote skeletal rearrangements.\n2.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** The absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a ketone (C=O) functional group, likely in a six-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The total integration is 2H + 10H + 2H = 14H. This means the product has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O. The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n3.  **Reconcile the Data:** A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O has four degrees of unsaturation. The data indicates the presence of one ketone (1 degree) and one double bond (1 degree). This leaves two degrees of unsaturation, which corresponds to a **bicyclic** structure (not the original tricyclic adamantane).\n4.  **Propose a Structure:** The only structure that fits all the data (bicyclic, C₁₀H₁₄O, ketone, exocyclic alkene) is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This product can be formed from the starting material via a known rearrangement pathway called a Grob fragmentation.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone functional group to an alcohol, leaving the carbon-carbon double bond unaffected.\n3.  **Structure of Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is converted into a ketone (=O). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Structure of Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one), we need to find the most deshielded proton, excluding the exchangeable alcohol proton (-OH). The proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is directly bonded to a carbon attached to an electronegative oxygen atom. This makes it the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton, with a typical chemical shift of ~3.5-4.5 ppm. Protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8) are less deshielded (~2.5-3.0 ppm).\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H-C3:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   **Conformation:** The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system exists in a stable chair-chair conformation. The hydroxyl group at C3 will preferentially occupy the equatorial position to minimize steric hindrance, placing the H-C3 proton in the axial position.\n    *   **Neighbors:** The H-C3 proton is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (CH₂) groups.\n    *   **Coupling Constants:**\n        *   H-C3 (axial) is coupled to the two axial protons on C2 and C4. Due to symmetry, these two protons are equivalent to each other. The dihedral angle is ~180° (axial-axial), resulting in a **large** coupling constant (J_A).\n        *   H-C3 (axial) is also coupled to the two equatorial protons on C2 and C4. These two protons are also equivalent to each other by symmetry. The dihedral angle is ~60° (axial-equatorial), resulting in a **small** coupling constant (J_B).\n    *   **Resulting Pattern:** The signal for H-C3 is split by two sets of two equivalent protons with different coupling constants (J_A ≠ J_B).\n        *   The coupling to the two axial protons (with J_A) splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n        *   Each line of this triplet is then further split by the two equatorial protons (with J_B) into another **triplet**.\n    *   The final, observable pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1\n\nThe first step is to identify the structure of Product 1, which is formed from the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. We must use all the provided spectral data to deduce the correct structure.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone in a six-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  The total proton count from the NMR is 2 + 10 + 2 = 14, which means the product has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    2.  The signal at 4.79 ppm is in the vinylic region and is highly characteristic of protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n    3.  The reaction conditions (strong base, high heat) on a 1,3-dihaloadamantane are known to promote skeletal rearrangements, often via a Grob fragmentation.\n    4.  A structure that perfectly fits all these pieces of evidence is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This molecule has the correct formula (C₁₀H₁₄O), contains a ketone in a six-membered ring (consistent with the IR peak), and has an exocyclic methylene group whose two protons account for the signal at 4.79 ppm. Other proposed pathways that ignore this crucial NMR data are less likely to be correct.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for reducing aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols. The carbon-carbon double bond is not affected.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3\n\nProduct 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond and replaces it with carbonyl groups.\n*   **Transformation:** The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) at C7 is cleaved. This process converts the C7 carbon into a ketone (=O) and releases the other carbon as formaldehyde (which is removed during workup). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in Product 3.\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C3, C9, and C7. It exists in a stable dual chair conformation.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In this keto-alcohol, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group. This is the carbinol proton, **H-C3**. Its chemical shift is typically in the 3.5-4.5 ppm range, which is significantly downfield from protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8) and other aliphatic protons.\n*   **Coupling Pattern of H-C3:** We need to analyze the protons that couple to H-C3.\n    1.  H-C3 is located on the molecule's plane of symmetry.\n    2.  It is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons: C2 and C4.\n    3.  Due to the plane of symmetry, the C2 methylene group is equivalent to the C4 methylene group. Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    4.  These four protons can be divided into two sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   **Set A:** The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4). These two protons are equivalent to each other. Coupling to these two protons will split the H-C3 signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n        *   **Set B:** The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4). These two protons are also equivalent to each other. Coupling to these two protons will further split each line of the first triplet into another **triplet**.\n    5.  The coupling constants for Set A (J_axial) and Set B (J_equatorial) will be different.\n*   **Conclusion:** The signal for the most deshielded proton (H-C3) is split into a triplet by one pair of equivalent protons, and each of those lines is further split into another triplet by a second pair of equivalent protons. The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, evaluating the chemical transformations and spectroscopic data to arrive at the correct structure and its corresponding NMR signal.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Conditions:** The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, a rigid tricyclic compound. It is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature. Standard elimination (E2) and substitution (Sₙ2) reactions are sterically hindered or violate Bredt's rule. These harsh conditions are known to promote skeletal rearrangements.\n2.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** A strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a definitive indicator of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows signals at **4.79 ppm (2H)**, 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The total integration is 14 protons, meaning the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The signal at 4.79 ppm is a crucial piece of evidence; it is in the characteristic range for vinylic protons, and the integration of 2H strongly suggests an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n3.  **Deduce the Structure:** We need a structure with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O that contains a ketone and an exocyclic double bond. The degree of unsaturation for C₁₀H₁₄O is 4. The ketone accounts for one degree, and the double bond for another. This leaves two degrees of unsaturation, which must correspond to a bicyclic (two-ring) system. Therefore, the reaction must involve the opening of the adamantane (tricyclic) cage.\n    *   The structure that perfectly fits all these constraints is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure is a known product from the Grob fragmentation of a 1-bromo-3-hydroxyadamantane intermediate, which is a plausible intermediate under the reaction conditions. This pathway is the only one that is consistent with all the provided data.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Identify the Transformation:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols while leaving carbon-carbon double bonds intact.\n3.  **Deduce the Structure:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Identify the Transformation:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction. It cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at position C7. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Deduce the Structure:** Product 3 is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one), we must identify the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. The proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is directly attached to a carbon bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically in the 3.5-4.5 ppm range, which is significantly more deshielded than the protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8, ~2.5-3.0 ppm) or other aliphatic protons. Therefore, the **carbinol proton (H-C3)** is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H-C3:**\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   The proton H-C3 is on carbon C3. It is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂) groups, so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent in their coupling relationship to H-C3 as the two protons on C4.\n    *   In the stable chair-chair conformation, we can distinguish between axial-type and equatorial-type protons. The two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) are equivalent to each other and will have one coupling constant (J_A) with H-C3. The two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) are also equivalent to each other and will have a different coupling constant (J_B) with H-C3.\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) will split the H-C3 signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2), also into a **triplet**.\n    *   The resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material & Reagents:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n2.  **Spectroscopic Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone in a six-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The total integration is 2H + 10H + 2H = 14H. This means the product has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O (starting with C₁₀H₁₄Br₂, losing 2 Br and gaining 1 O).\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n3.  **Structural Deduction:**\n    *   The adamantane skeleton is tricyclic. A saturated tricyclic ketone (like adamantanone) would have a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O, which has 4 degrees of unsaturation (3 for the rings, 1 for the C=O). This matches the proton count.\n    *   However, a saturated ketone cannot have a vinylic proton signal at 4.79 ppm.\n    *   An unsaturated ketone containing both a C=O and a C=C would have 5 degrees of unsaturation, corresponding to a formula of C₁₀H₁₂O. This contradicts the 14H proton count.\n    *   The only way to reconcile all the data (14H, C=O, and C=C) is if the tricyclic adamantane cage has opened to form a **bicyclic** structure. A bicyclic structure has 2 degrees of unsaturation. Adding a C=O (1 DoU) and a C=C (1 DoU) gives a total of 4 degrees of unsaturation, which corresponds to the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n4.  **Plausible Structure:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions is known to proceed via a Grob fragmentation. This rearrangement leads to the formation of **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure perfectly matches all the provided data: it is a bicyclic ketone with an exocyclic methylene group and has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols while leaving C=C double bonds unaffected.\n3.  **Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to an alcohol. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position (C7). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through the C3-OH and C7=O groups.\n2.  **Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). This is due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the oxygen atom.\n3.  **Coupling Pattern of H-C3:** We need to analyze the protons that will split the signal of H-C3. H-C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Both C2 and C4 are methylene (CH₂) groups. So, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the coupling of H-C3 to the two protons on C2 is identical to its coupling to the two protons on C4.\n    *   Let's assume the stable chair-chair conformation. The hydroxyl group at C3 will preferentially occupy the equatorial position to minimize steric interactions, placing the H-C3 proton in the axial position.\n    *   An axial H-C3 is coupled to two equivalent axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) with a large coupling constant (J_ax, typically 10-13 Hz).\n    *   It is also coupled to two other equivalent equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) with a small coupling constant (J_eq, typically 2-5 Hz).\n4.  **Resulting Pattern:**\n    *   The coupling to the two equivalent axial-type protons (n=2) splits the H-C3 signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent equatorial-type protons (n=2) into another **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, the final observed pattern for the most deshielded proton is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer from the provided options.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\nThe first step is the most critical, as it dictates the rest of the reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh conditions known to cause skeletal rearrangements, as a simple elimination is forbidden by Bredt's rule.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ strongly indicates a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows a total of 14 protons (2H + 10H + 2H), which means the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. A key feature is the signal at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O has four degrees of unsaturation. The ketone (C=O) and the double bond (C=C) account for two degrees. Therefore, the carbon skeleton must have two rings, meaning it is bicyclic. This confirms that the tricyclic adamantane cage has undergone a ring-opening rearrangement.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** The structure must be a bicyclic ketone containing an exocyclic methylene group. The most plausible structure that fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure is a known product of the Grob fragmentation of adamantane derivatives under these conditions.

The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone at position C7, with formaldehyde being formed as a byproduct. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton)?\n*   **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). This is due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically higher than that of protons alpha to the ketone.\n*   **Analyzing the Coupling Pattern:**\n    1.  The molecule bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one has a plane of symmetry that passes through atoms C3 and C7.\n    2.  The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (CH₂) groups.\n    3.  Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are in an equivalent environment to the two protons on C4.\n    4.  The proton H-C3 is coupled to two sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   It couples to the two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4). Coupling to these two equivalent protons splits the signal into a **triplet** (n=2, so n+1=3).\n        *   It also couples to the two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4). This coupling further splits each line of the first triplet into another **triplet**.\n    5.  The coupling constants for the axial and equatorial sets are different, resulting in a distinct pattern.\n*   **Conclusion:** The resulting coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton (H-C3) is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It is reacted with excess KOH at 240°C. The key is to interpret the provided spectral data for the resulting Product 1 correctly, as this determines the rest of the reaction sequence.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a ketone (C=O) group.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows a total of 14 protons (2H + 10H + 2H), which is the same number as in the starting material. This implies a molecular formula of C₁₀H₁₄O. A crucial signal is at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n*   **Reconciling the Data:** A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O has four degrees of unsaturation. A ketone accounts for one, and a double bond accounts for another. This leaves two degrees of unsaturation, which corresponds to a bicyclic (two-ring) structure. This means the original tricyclic adamantane cage must have opened during the reaction.\n*   **Plausible Structure:** A known reaction for 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions is a Grob fragmentation, which opens the cage. A plausible product that fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure has a bicyclic core, a ketone in one of the six-membered rings (consistent with the IR peak), and an exocyclic methylene group (consistent with the NMR signal at 4.79 ppm). This pathway, as detailed in Answer 15, is the most logical as it honors all the initial experimental data without making assumptions that the data is erroneous.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol. The double bond is not affected by this reagent.\n\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to an alcohol, yielding **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The exocyclic double bond (=CH₂) at position C7 is cleaved. The CH₂ group becomes formaldehyde (which is removed), and the C7 carbon becomes a carbonyl group (a ketone). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in Product 3.\n\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, the most deshielded proton (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton) is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group. This is the carbinol proton at position C3 (H-C3), which is deshielded by the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom.\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7. This symmetry is critical for determining the coupling pattern.\n*   **Coupling Analysis:** The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Each of these carbons (C2 and C4) is a methylene (-CH₂) group, so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are chemically equivalent to the two protons on C4.\n    *   In the stable chair-chair conformation of the bicyclic system, the four neighboring protons can be grouped into two distinct sets: two equivalent axial-type protons and two equivalent equatorial-type protons.\n    *   The coupling constant between H-C3 and the two equivalent axial-type protons (J_ax) will be different from the coupling constant to the two equivalent equatorial-type protons (J_eq).\n*   **Resulting Pattern:**\n    1.  The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent axial-type protons. According to the n+1 rule (where n=2), this gives a **triplet**.\n    2.  Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the other two equivalent equatorial-type protons, which also results in a **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, the final, observable coupling pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",
