The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks.

This proves that the two species are **isomers**—they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight but a different arrangement of atoms.\n    *   This immediately **rules out option D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**, because a precursor would have a different (usually lower) molecular weight.\n    *   This also **rules out option C) 'Double coupling' has occurred**, as this side reaction would create a larger molecule with a higher molecular weight.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data:** We are left with two possibilities: the isomers are either enantiomers or diastereoisomers.\n    *   The LC analysis shows two clearly defined, separable peaks.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single proton.\n    *   These two observations mean that the two isomeric species have different physical and chemical properties, which allows them to be distinguished by these standard analytical techniques.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they cannot be distinguished by a standard NMR spectrometer (they would show a single set of peaks) or separated by a standard (achiral) LC column (they would elute as a single peak). This explanation is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereomers will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons in two diastereomers would have different chemical shifts, explaining the two observed peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard chromatography techniques like LC. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only explanation that fits all the experimental evidence is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers. This is a common phenomenon in peptide chemistry, often arising from either epimerization at a chiral center during synthesis or the presence of stable *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) around an amide bond.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Experimental Data\n\n1.  **LC-MS Data Analysis**: The most definitive piece of information comes from the mass spectrometer. The data shows two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace, but both peaks yield the **same mass spectrum**, which is consistent with the expected molecule.\n    *   **Implication**: This proves that the two species being observed are **isomers**—they have the same molecular formula and mass but different structures.\n    *   **Elimination**: This single fact immediately rules out any explanation involving a compound with a different molecular weight.\n        *   **Option (B) Contamination with a precursor** is incorrect because a precursor would have a different, likely lower, mass.\n        *   **Option (C) 'Double coupling'** is incorrect because this side reaction would create a larger molecule with a higher mass.\n\n2.  **NMR and LC Data Analysis**: With options B and C eliminated, we must now distinguish between the two remaining types of isomers: diastereoisomers (A) and enantiomers (D).\n    *   **Observation**: The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single proton, and the LC trace shows two separable peaks. This means the two isomers are distinguishable and separable using standard (achiral) analytical techniques.\n    *   **Evaluating Option (D) Enantiomers**: Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In an achiral environment (like a standard NMR solvent or a standard LC column), they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce a *single* set of peaks in the NMR and elute as a *single* peak in the LC. This is inconsistent with the observations.\n    *   **Evaluating Option (A) Diastereoisomers**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   Because they are chemically distinct, they are expected to have different NMR spectra, which explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   Because they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, shape), they can be separated by standard chromatography, which explains the two peaks in the LC.\n        *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the experimental data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe evidence points conclusively to one answer. The two species are isomers (same mass), but they are not enantiomers because they are easily distinguished by standard NMR and LC techniques. Therefore, they must be diastereomers. In the context of peptide synthesis, this is a common occurrence, often arising from either the epimerization of a chiral center or the presence of stable *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) around a peptide bond.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Synthesize the Evidence:** I will first consolidate the key pieces of information from the problem description and the candidate answers.\n    *   **Unanimous Reasoning:** All candidate answers, regardless of their final letter choice, agree on the scientific reasoning. The core conclusion is that the observed phenomena are characteristic of a mixture of diastereomers. The discrepancy in the final letter choices (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`) stems from the fact that the options were re-ordered or re-lettered in each candidate's response. I will ignore the candidates' final letter choices and focus on their shared, correct scientific logic.\n    *   **Key Observation 1 (from LC-MS):** The sample contains two species that have the *same mass*, and this mass matches the expected product. This is the most critical piece of data. It proves the two species are **isomers**.\n    *   **Key Observation 2 (from NMR & LC):** The two species are distinguishable by standard ¹H NMR (two peaks for one proton) and separable by standard liquid chromatography (two LC peaks). This means the two isomers have different physical and chemical properties in a standard (achiral) environment.\n\n2.  **Step-by-Step Elimination:** I will use these key observations to systematically evaluate the options provided in the *original* question.\n    *   **Original Options:**\n        *   A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers\n        *   B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction\n        *   C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor\n        *   D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers\n    *   **Elimination based on Mass (Observation 1):** Since the two species are isomers (same mass), we can rule out any option that implies a different mass.\n        *   A precursor (Option C) would have a different (usually lower) mass. **Eliminate C.**\n        *   A 'double coupling' product (Option B) would have a different (higher) mass. **Eliminate B.**\n    *   **Elimination based on Properties (Observation 2):** We are left with two types of isomers: diastereomers (A) and enantiomers (D). The two species are separable by standard LC and distinguishable by standard NMR.\n        *   Enantiomers (Option D) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They would *not* separate on a standard LC column and would produce a *single* set of peaks in a standard NMR spectrum. This contradicts the observations. **Eliminate D.**\n        *   Diastereoisomers (Option A) have different physical properties. They *are* separable by standard LC and *do* produce different NMR spectra. This is perfectly consistent with all observations. **This is the correct answer.**\n\n3.  **Code Implementation:** I will create a Python script that codifies this logical deduction.

This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n    *   **Option B ('Double Coupling'):** This side reaction would create a larger molecule with a higher molecular weight. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data\nWe are left with two possibilities: the compound is a mixture of enantiomers (Option C) or diastereoisomers (Option D).\n*   **Observation:** The Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates the sample into two distinct peaks. The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton.\n*   **Careful Point:** This means the two isomeric species have different physical and chemical properties, allowing them to be distinguished by these standard analytical techniques.\n*   **Evaluation of Option C (Enantiomers):** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard, achiral environment (like a typical NMR solvent or a standard LC column), they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce a *single* peak in the NMR and a *single* peak in the LC. This option is inconsistent with the observation of two peaks in both experiments.\n*   **Evaluation of Option D (Diastereoisomers):** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   Because they are chemically distinct, they will have different NMR spectra, explaining the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n    *   Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard chromatography, explaining the two LC peaks.\n    *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all observations: the two species are isomers (same mass) but are not enantiomers (as they are distinguishable by standard NMR and LC).\n\n### Step 3: Synthesize the Conclusion\nThe combined evidence points unequivocally to one answer. The two species observed have the same mass (ruling out precursors and side-products) but are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR (ruling out enantiomers). Therefore, the two species must be diastereoisomers. In the context of a synthesized peptide, this is a common outcome, often due to epimerization at a chiral center or the presence of stable *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) around an amide bond.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:** The problem states that LC-MS analysis shows two peaks, and \"Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule.\"\n    *   This is a critical piece of information. It means the two species being observed are **isomers**—they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass.\n    *   This immediately **rules out** Option B (\"The compound is contaminated with a precursor\") and Option C (\"'Double coupling' has occurred...\"). Both a precursor and a 'double coupling' product would have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass than the expected product.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data:** We are left with two possibilities: the isomers are either enantiomers (Option A) or diastereoisomers (Option D).\n    *   The LC analysis shows \"two clearly defined peaks.\" This means the two isomeric species have different physical properties that allow them to be separated by the chromatography column.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton.\" This means the proton exists in two distinct chemical environments, which is only possible if the two isomers are chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   Let's evaluate the remaining options based on these facts:\n        *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they cannot be separated by a standard LC column and they produce identical NMR spectra. They would appear as a *single* peak in both the LC and the NMR. This contradicts the observations.\n        *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties. Because they are chemically distinct, they are expected to have different NMR spectra (explaining the two alpha-proton peaks). Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard chromatography (explaining the two LC peaks). This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the experimental data.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of two separable species with the same mass, which are also distinguishable by NMR, is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture. In the context of peptide synthesis, this is a common outcome, often due to either epimerization at a chiral center or the presence of stable *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) around a peptide bond. Both of these phenomena result in a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided information.\n\n### Analysis of the Experimental Observations\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**: The LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks in the chromatogram, but crucially, both peaks yield the **same mass spectrum**. This mass is also consistent with the expected product. This single piece of evidence allows us to draw a firm conclusion: the two species are **isomers**. They have the same molecular formula and weight but differ in their atomic arrangement. This immediately rules out any explanation involving a compound with a different molecular formula.\n\n2.  **Liquid Chromatography (LC) Data**: The fact that the two isomers are separated into two clearly defined peaks by the LC column means they have **different physical properties**. The column interacts differently with each isomer, causing them to travel at different speeds and elute at different times.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**: The NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with roughly equal integrals. Since spin-spin coupling has been ruled out, this indicates that the proton exists in two different, stable chemical environments. The equal integrals confirm that the two species are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio, which is consistent with the equal intensity peaks in the LC.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\nLet's evaluate each option against these three key points:\n\n*   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**: This would result in a product with a higher molecular weight (e.g., an extra amino acid was added). This is inconsistent with the MS data, which shows the expected mass for both species.\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**: A precursor would be a different molecule with a different (usually lower) molecular weight. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore:\n    *   They would **not** be separated by a standard LC column (they would show one peak).\n    *   They would **not** be distinguishable by a standard NMR spectrometer (they would show one set of peaks).\n    This option is inconsistent with both the LC and NMR data.\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other.\n    *   They have **different physical and chemical properties**.\n    *   This difference in properties means they **can be separated by standard LC**, explaining the two peaks.\n    *   This chemical difference also means they will have **different NMR spectra**, explaining the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n    *   As isomers, they have the **same molecular formula and mass**, which is perfectly consistent with the MS data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only explanation that fits all the experimental evidence is that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers. In the context of peptide synthesis, this is a common occurrence, often arising from either the epimerization of a chiral center during a coupling step or the presence of stable *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) around a peptide bond. Both scenarios result in a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\nThe crucial observation from the LC-MS analysis is that there are two distinct peaks on the chromatogram (LC), but both peaks yield the **same mass spectrum**, and this mass is consistent with the expected product.\n\n*   **Implication**: The two species present in the sample are **isomers**.

This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**: This side reaction implies the addition of an extra amino acid or reagent, which would result in a product with a significantly higher molecular weight. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data\nWe are now left with two possibilities: the isomers are either enantiomers or diastereoisomers.\n\n*   **Observation**: The two species are separated into two distinct peaks by the LC column and show two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **Implication**: This means the two isomers have different physical and chemical properties, allowing them to be distinguished by these standard analytical techniques.\n*   **Evaluating the remaining options**:\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they cannot be separated by a standard LC column and would produce only a single set of peaks in a standard NMR experiment. The observation of two separate peaks in both techniques rules out this option.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **Consistency with LC**: Because they have different properties, they can be separated by standard chromatography.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR**: Because they are chemically distinct molecules, their corresponding protons exist in different environments and will have different chemical shifts in an NMR spectrum.\n        *   **Consistency with MS**: As isomers, they have the same mass.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only explanation that is consistent with all the experimental data is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. They are isomers (same mass), but they have different properties that allow them to be separated by LC and distinguished by NMR. In the context of peptide synthesis, this is a common phenomenon, often caused by racemization at one of the chiral centers or by the presence of stable *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) around a peptide bond.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most likely explanation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**: The LC-MS analysis reveals two distinct peaks in the chromatogram, but crucially, both peaks yield the **same mass spectrum**. This mass is also consistent with the expected product. This single piece of evidence is powerful because it confirms that the two species are **isomers**—they share the same molecular formula and mass but have a different spatial arrangement of atoms. This immediately allows us to evaluate the options based on mass:\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling'**: This side reaction would involve adding an extra chemical moiety (like another amino acid), resulting in a product with a *higher mass*. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n    *   **B) Contamination with a precursor**: A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate in the synthesis. It would have a different chemical formula and thus a *different mass* (usually lower) than the final product. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data**: With options A and B ruled out, we are left to distinguish between the two types of isomers: enantiomers (C) and diastereoisomers (D).\n    *   **LC Data**: The liquid chromatography separates the mixture into two distinct peaks. This means the two isomers have different physical properties (like polarity or shape), which causes them to interact differently with the chromatography column and elute at different times.\n    *   **NMR Data**: The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. This indicates that the proton exists in two different chemical environments, meaning the two isomers are chemically distinguishable by NMR.\n    *   **Evaluate Option C (Enantiomers)**: Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce a *single* peak in a standard NMR spectrum and would co-elute as a *single* peak on a standard LC column. This option is inconsistent with both the LC and NMR observations.\n    *   **Evaluate Option D (Diastereoisomers)**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties. Their different physical properties allow them to be separated by standard LC, and their different chemical nature causes them to have distinct NMR spectra. This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the experimental data.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Conclusion**: The observations of two separable species by LC, which are distinguishable by NMR but have the identical mass, is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture. In peptide synthesis, this is a common issue that can arise from two main sources:\n    *   **Epimerization**: The inversion of a chiral center (e.g., an L-amino acid flipping to a D-amino acid) during the synthesis creates a diastereomer.\n    *   **Rotamers**: Restricted rotation around the amide (peptide) bond can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers. These conformers are a type of diastereomer and are often stable enough to be observed as separate species by both NMR and LC.\n\nTherefore, the only explanation that fits all the facts is that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most likely explanation for the observations.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:** The most critical piece of information is that the LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks that both have the *same mass spectrum*, and this mass is consistent with the expected molecule.\n    *   This tells us that the two species being observed are **isomers**—they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass.\n    *   This immediately **rules out contamination with a precursor** (Option A), as a precursor would have a different, likely lower, molecular weight.\n    *   This also **rules out 'double coupling'** (Option C), as this side reaction would create a larger molecule with a higher molecular weight.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data:** Now that we know we have a mixture of isomers, we need to determine what kind of isomers they are.\n    *   The Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates the mixture into two distinct peaks.

In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce a *single* peak on a standard LC column and a *single* set of peaks in a standard NMR experiment. The observation of two separate peaks in both LC and NMR definitively rules out this option.\n    *   **Option B: Mixture of diastereoisomers.** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other.

This side reaction would create a larger molecule with a higher mass.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data**\n\n*   **Observation:** The two isomers are separated into two distinct peaks by liquid chromatography (LC). The ¹H NMR spectrum also shows two distinct peaks for a single proton.\n*   **Interpretation:** This means the two isomers have different physical and chemical properties. They interact differently with the LC column, allowing for their separation. Their protons exist in slightly different chemical environments, causing them to have different resonance frequencies (chemical shifts) in the NMR spectrum.\n*   **Evaluation of Remaining Isomer Types:**\n    *   **(D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they cannot be distinguished by standard ¹H NMR (they would show a single set of peaks) or separated by a standard (achiral) LC column (they would elute as a single peak). This option is inconsistent with the observation of two separate peaks in both techniques.\n    *   **(C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties. This difference means they are expected to have different NMR spectra and can be separated by standard chromatography. This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the observations.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence points to a single conclusion: the sample is a mixture of two compounds that have the same mass (isomers) but different physical properties, making them separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR. This is the definition of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\nIn the context of peptide chemistry, this is a common phenomenon that can arise from two main sources:\n1.  **Epimerization:** The inversion of a single chiral center (e.g., an L-amino acid flipping to a D-amino acid) during synthesis creates a diastereomer.\n2.  **Rotamers:** Restricted rotation around the amide (peptide) bond can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers. These conformers are a type of diastereomer and are often observed as separate species by NMR and LC.\n\nBoth scenarios result in a mixture of diastereoisomers, making this the only plausible explanation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\nThe most crucial piece of information is that the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks, but **both peaks have the same mass spectrum**, and this mass is consistent with the expected molecule.\n\n*   This tells us that the two chemical species being observed are **isomers**—they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass.\n*   This immediately rules out any explanation involving a molecule with a different mass.\n    *   **Option (B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor is a starting material or intermediate and would have a different (usually lower) molecular weight. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n    *   **Option (D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This side reaction would create a larger molecule with a higher molecular weight. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\nWe can confidently eliminate options (B) and (D). The problem is now reduced to identifying the correct type of isomerism.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data\nWe are left with two possibilities: enantiomers or diastereoisomers. The data shows that the two species are separable and distinguishable.\n\n*   **Observation:** The Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates the sample into two distinct peaks. The ¹H NMR spectrum also shows two distinct peaks for a single proton.\n*   **Implication:** This means the two isomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options based on this implication:\n\n*   **Option (A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have **identical** physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would not be separated by a standard LC column (they would elute as a single peak) and would be indistinguishable in a standard NMR experiment (producing a single set of signals). This option is inconsistent with the observation of two separate peaks in both the LC and NMR.\n\n*   **Option (C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. They have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n    *   Because they have different properties, they can be separated by standard LC, which explains the two LC peaks.\n    *   Because they are chemically distinct, they will have different NMR spectra, which explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n    *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the experimental data. In peptide chemistry, this is a common phenomenon, often caused by either the partial racemization of an amino acid's chiral center during synthesis or by the presence of stable *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) around a peptide bond.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only explanation that fits all the experimental observations is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. They are isomers (same mass), but they have different physical properties, allowing them to be separated by LC and distinguished by NMR.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\nThe problem states that LC-MS analysis shows two peaks, but both have the **same mass spectrum**, which is consistent with the expected molecule. This is a crucial piece of evidence. It tells us that the two species being observed are **isomers**—they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass.\n\nThis observation immediately allows us to eliminate options that involve a change in mass:\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor is a starting material or intermediate. It would have a different chemical formula and a different (usually lower) mass. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n*   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This implies a side reaction where an extra component (e.g., another amino acid) has been added. This would result in a product with a different (higher) mass. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data\nAfter Step 1, we are left with two possibilities: the compound is a mixture of enantiomers (A) or diastereoisomers (D). The LC and NMR data allow us to distinguish between these.\n\n*   **Observation:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the sample into two distinct peaks.\n*   **Observation:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton.\n\nThese observations tell us that the two isomers have **different physical and chemical properties** under standard analytical conditions.\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce a **single, overlapping peak** in a standard NMR spectrum and would **not separate** on a standard LC column (they would elute as a single peak). To distinguish them, special chiral conditions (e.g., a chiral LC column or a chiral NMR solvent) are required, which were not specified. This option is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have **different physical and chemical properties**.\n    *   Because they are chemically distinct, they are expected to have different NMR spectra, which explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n    *   Because they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, shape), they can be separated by standard chromatography techniques like LC, which explains the two peaks in the chromatogram.\n    *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all observations: the two species are isomers (same mass), but they are separable and distinguishable by standard analytical methods.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers. This is a common issue in peptide synthesis, where either epimerization of a chiral center or the presence of stable *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) around an amide bond can create a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided information to determine the most likely explanation.\n\n### **Analysis of the Experimental Data**\n\n1.  **LC-MS Data Analysis:**\n    *   **Observation:** The mass spectrometry (MS) data shows that both separated peaks have the same mass spectrum, and this mass is consistent with the expected molecule.\n    *   **Implication:** This is a critical piece of evidence. It proves that the two chemical species are **isomers**—they share the same molecular formula and weight. This immediately rules out any explanation involving a compound with a different mass.\n    *   **Ruling out options:**\n        *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate in the synthesis. It would have a different, likely lower, molecular weight. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n        *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This side reaction implies the addition of an extra amino acid or coupling agent, which would result in a product with a different, higher molecular weight. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR and LC Data Analysis:**\n    *   **Observation:** The crude compound is separated into two distinct peaks by liquid chromatography (LC), and the ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n    *   **Implication:** This means the two isomers have different physical and chemical properties, allowing them to be separated by chromatography and distinguished by NMR spectroscopy under standard (achiral) conditions.\n    *   **Ruling out the remaining option:**\n        *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard, achiral environment (like a typical NMR solvent or a standard LC column), they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce a single, overlapping peak in the NMR and would co-elute as a single peak in the LC. The observation of two separate peaks in both techniques definitively rules out enantiomers.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only remaining explanation that is consistent with all the experimental evidence is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n*   **Consistency with Data:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   Because they are chemically distinct, they give different NMR spectra, explaining the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n    *   Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard chromatography, explaining the two LC peaks.\n    *   As isomers, they have the same molecular formula and mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n\n*   **Plausibility in Peptide Synthesis:** This is a very common occurrence in peptide chemistry. Diastereomers can be formed either by the inversion of a stereocenter during the synthesis (epimerization) or, very commonly, by the presence of stable *cis* and *trans* isomers (rotamers) around a peptide bond. These rotamers are a specific type of diastereomer and are known to be separable and distinguishable by LC and NMR.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Analysis of the Experimental Observations\n\n1.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** The crude compound separates into two distinct peaks on the Liquid Chromatography (LC) column. This indicates the sample is a mixture of at least two different chemical species that have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, size, shape), allowing them to be separated.\n    *   **Observation:** Both peaks have the *same mass spectrum*, and this mass is consistent with the expected molecule. This is the most critical piece of evidence. It proves that the two separated species are **isomers**—they have the same molecular formula and mass but a different arrangement of atoms.\n    *   **Conclusion from LC-MS:** This data immediately rules out any explanation involving a change in molecular formula or mass.\n        *   **Ruled Out:** Contamination with a precursor (Option A) is incorrect because a precursor would have a different, likely lower, mass.\n        *   **Ruled Out:** 'Double coupling' (Option D) is incorrect because this side reaction would create a product with a different, higher, mass.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data in Conjunction with LC-MS:**\n    *   **Observation:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with roughly equal integrals. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this confirms the presence of two distinct molecular species in a ~1:1 ratio, where the alpha-proton exists in a slightly different chemical environment in each species.\n    *   **Remaining Options:** We are left to decide between a mixture of enantiomers (Option B) and a mixture of diastereoisomers (Option C).\n    *   **Evaluating Enantiomers (Option B):** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce a *single* set of peaks in a standard NMR experiment and would elute as a *single* peak on a standard LC column. This explanation is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data, which show two distinct peaks.\n    *   **Evaluating Diastereoisomers (Option C):** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   Their different chemical properties mean they are expected to have different NMR spectra, explaining the two distinct peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   Their different physical properties mean they can be separated by standard chromatography techniques, explaining the two distinct peaks in the LC.\n        *   As isomers, they have the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only explanation that is consistent with all the experimental evidence is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. The two species are isomers (same mass), but they are chemically and physically distinct, allowing them to be distinguished by NMR and separated by LC. In the context of a chemically synthesized peptide, this is a common occurrence, often arising from either epimerization at a chiral center or the presence of stable *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) around a peptide bond.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, integrating the key points from the provided answers.\n\n**1.

This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data**\n\n*   **Observation:** The two species are separated into two distinct peaks by liquid chromatography (LC). The ¹H NMR spectrum also shows two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton.\n*   **Careful Point:** This means the two isomers have **different physical and chemical properties** in a standard (achiral) environment. Their different physical properties cause them to interact differently with the LC column, allowing for separation. Their different chemical properties place the alpha-proton in two distinct electronic environments, causing two different NMR signals.\n*   **Conclusion:** We must now evaluate the remaining isomer types based on this fact.\n    *   **Option A (The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers):** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In an achiral environment (like a standard LC column or NMR solvent), they have **identical** physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce a single set of peaks in the NMR and elute as a single peak in the LC. This explanation is inconsistent with the observation of two separate peaks in both techniques.\n    *   **Option C (The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers):** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. Crucially, they have **different** physical and chemical properties. This difference perfectly explains why they can be separated by standard LC and why they produce different signals in an NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 3: Synthesize the Final Answer**\n\nThe only explanation that is consistent with all the experimental data is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. They are isomers (same mass), but they have different physical and chemical properties that allow them to be separated by LC and distinguished by NMR.\n\nThis is a common phenomenon in peptide synthesis, often arising from two possible sources:\n1.  **Epimerization:** The inversion of a single chiral center (e.g., an L-amino acid flipping to a D-amino acid) during synthesis creates a diastereomer.\n2.  **Rotamers:** Restricted rotation around an amide (peptide) bond can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers. These conformers are a type of diastereomer and are often stable enough to be observed as separate species by NMR and LC, especially at or below room temperature.\n\n<<<C>>>"

The two species are isomers (same mass), but they are not enantiomers because they are easily distinguished by standard NMR and LC techniques. Therefore, they must be diastereomers.

The core conclusion is that the observed phenomena are characteristic of a mixture of diastereomers.

I will ignore the candidates' final letter choices and focus on their shared, correct scientific logic.\n    *   **Key Observation 1 (from LC-MS):** The sample contains two species that have the *same mass*, and this mass matches the expected product. This is the most critical piece of data. It proves the two species are **isomers**.\n    *   **Key Observation 2 (from NMR & LC):** The two species are distinguishable by standard ¹H NMR (two peaks for one proton) and separable by standard liquid chromatography (two LC peaks). This means the two isomers have different physical and chemical properties in a standard (achiral) environment.\n\n2.  **Step-by-Step Elimination:** I will use these key observations to systematically evaluate the options provided in the *original* question.\n    *   **Original Options:**\n        *   A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers\n        *   B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction\n        *   C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor\n        *   D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers\n    *   **Elimination based on Mass (Observation 1):** Since the two species are isomers (same mass), we can rule out any option that implies a different mass.\n        *   A precursor (Option C) would have a different (usually lower) mass. **Eliminate C.**\n        *   A 'double coupling' product (Option B) would have a different (higher) mass. **Eliminate B.**\n    *   **Elimination based on Properties (Observation 2):** We are left with two types of isomers: diastereomers (A) and enantiomers (D). The two species are separable by standard LC and distinguishable by standard NMR.\n        *   Enantiomers (Option D) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They would *not* separate on a standard LC column and would produce a *single* set of peaks in a standard NMR spectrum. This contradicts the observations. **Eliminate D.**\n        *   Diastereoisomers (Option A) have different physical properties.

The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton.\n*   **Careful Point:** This means the two isomeric species have different physical and chemical properties, allowing them to be distinguished by these standard analytical techniques.\n*   **Evaluation of Option C (Enantiomers):** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard, achiral environment (like a typical NMR solvent or a standard LC column), they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce a *single* peak in the NMR and a *single* peak in the LC. This option is inconsistent with the observation of two peaks in both experiments.\n*   **Evaluation of Option D (Diastereoisomers):** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other.

The two species observed have the same mass (ruling out precursors and side-products) but are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR (ruling out enantiomers). Therefore, the two species must be diastereoisomers. In the context of a synthesized peptide, this is a common outcome, often due to epimerization at a chiral center or the presence of stable *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) around an amide bond.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:** The problem states that LC-MS analysis shows two peaks, and \"Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule.\"\n    *   This is a critical piece of information. It means the two species being observed are **isomers**—they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass.\n    *   This immediately **rules out** Option B (\"The compound is contaminated with a precursor\") and Option C (\"'Double coupling' has occurred...\"). Both a precursor and a 'double coupling' product would have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass than the expected product.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data:** We are left with two possibilities: the isomers are either enantiomers (Option A) or diastereoisomers (Option D).\n    *   The LC analysis shows \"two clearly defined peaks.\" This means the two isomeric species have different physical properties that allow them to be separated by the chromatography column.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton.\" This means the proton exists in two distinct chemical environments, which is only possible if the two isomers are chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   Let's evaluate the remaining options based on these facts:\n        *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they cannot be separated by a standard LC column and they produce identical NMR spectra. They would appear as a *single* peak in both the LC and the NMR. This contradicts the observations.\n        *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties. Because they are chemically distinct, they are expected to have different NMR spectra (explaining the two alpha-proton peaks). Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard chromatography (explaining the two LC peaks). This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the experimental data.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of two separable species with the same mass, which are also distinguishable by NMR, is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture. In the context of peptide synthesis, this is a common outcome, often due to either epimerization at a chiral center or the presence of stable *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) around a peptide bond. Both of these phenomena result in a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided information.\n\n### Analysis of the Experimental Observations\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**: The LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks in the chromatogram, but crucially, both peaks yield the **same mass spectrum**. This mass is also consistent with the expected product. This single piece of evidence allows us to draw a firm conclusion: the two species are **isomers**. They have the same molecular formula and weight but differ in their atomic arrangement. This immediately rules out any explanation involving a compound with a different molecular formula.\n\n2.  **Liquid Chromatography (LC) Data**: The fact that the two isomers are separated into two clearly defined peaks by the LC column means they have **different physical properties**. The column interacts differently with each isomer, causing them to travel at different speeds and elute at different times.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**: The NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with roughly equal integrals. Since spin-spin coupling has been ruled out, this indicates that the proton exists in two different, stable chemical environments. The equal integrals confirm that the two species are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio, which is consistent with the equal intensity peaks in the LC.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\nLet's evaluate each option against these three key points:\n\n*   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**: This would result in a product with a higher molecular weight (e.g., an extra amino acid was added).

The observation of two separate peaks in both techniques rules out this option.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other.

They are isomers (same mass), but they have different properties that allow them to be separated by LC and distinguished by NMR. In the context of peptide synthesis, this is a common phenomenon, often caused by racemization at one of the chiral centers or by the presence of stable *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) around a peptide bond.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most likely explanation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**: The LC-MS analysis reveals two distinct peaks in the chromatogram, but crucially, both peaks yield the **same mass spectrum**. This mass is also consistent with the expected product. This single piece of evidence is powerful because it confirms that the two species are **isomers**—they share the same molecular formula and mass but have a different spatial arrangement of atoms. This immediately allows us to evaluate the options based on mass:\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling'**: This side reaction would involve adding an extra chemical moiety (like another amino acid), resulting in a product with a *higher mass*. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n    *   **B) Contamination with a precursor**: A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate in the synthesis. It would have a different chemical formula and thus a *different mass* (usually lower) than the final product. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data**: With options A and B ruled out, we are left to distinguish between the two types of isomers: enantiomers (C) and diastereoisomers (D).\n    *   **LC Data**: The liquid chromatography separates the mixture into two distinct peaks. This means the two isomers have different physical properties (like polarity or shape), which causes them to interact differently with the chromatography column and elute at different times.\n    *   **NMR Data**: The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. This indicates that the proton exists in two different chemical environments, meaning the two isomers are chemically distinguishable by NMR.\n    *   **Evaluate Option C (Enantiomers)**: Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce a *single* peak in a standard NMR spectrum and would co-elute as a *single* peak on a standard LC column. This option is inconsistent with both the LC and NMR observations.\n    *   **Evaluate Option D (Diastereoisomers)**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties. Their different physical properties allow them to be separated by standard LC, and their different chemical nature causes them to have distinct NMR spectra. This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the experimental data.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Conclusion**: The observations of two separable species by LC, which are distinguishable by NMR but have the identical mass, is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture. In peptide synthesis, this is a common issue that can arise from two main sources:\n    *   **Epimerization**: The inversion of a chiral center (e.g., an L-amino acid flipping to a D-amino acid) during the synthesis creates a diastereomer.\n    *   **Rotamers**: Restricted rotation around the amide (peptide) bond can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers. These conformers are a type of diastereomer and are often stable enough to be observed as separate species by both NMR and LC.\n\nTherefore, the only explanation that fits all the facts is that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most likely explanation for the observations.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:** The most critical piece of information is that the LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks that both have the *same mass spectrum*, and this mass is consistent with the expected molecule.\n    *   This tells us that the two species being observed are **isomers**—they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass.\n    *   This immediately **rules out contamination with a precursor** (Option A), as a precursor would have a different, likely lower, molecular weight.\n    *   This also **rules out 'double coupling'** (Option C), as this side reaction would create a larger molecule with a higher molecular weight.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data:** Now that we know we have a mixture of isomers, we need to determine what kind of isomers they are.\n    *   The Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates the mixture into two distinct peaks.

This means the proton exists in two different chemical environments, confirming the presence of two distinct molecular species.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Options:**\n    *   **Option D: Mixture of enantiomers.** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce a *single* peak on a standard LC column and a *single* set of peaks in a standard NMR experiment. The observation of two separate peaks in both LC and NMR definitively rules out this option.\n    *   **Option B: Mixture of diastereoisomers.** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. Crucially, they have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   Because they have different physical properties, they **can be separated by standard LC**, which explains the two observed peaks.\n        *   Because they are chemically distinct molecules, they **will have different NMR spectra**, explaining why a single proton type appears as two separate peaks.\n        *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the experimental data: the two species are isomers (same mass), but they are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only explanation that fits all the evidence is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers. In the context of peptide synthesis, this is a common occurrence, often due to either epimerization at a chiral center or the presence of stable *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) around a peptide bond.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\n*   **Observation:** The LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks in the chromatogram (LC), but both peaks yield the *same mass spectrum*. This mass is consistent with the expected product.\n*   **Interpretation:** This is the most crucial piece of information for eliminating incorrect options. It proves that the two species being observed are **isomers**—they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass.\n*   **Elimination:**\n    *   This observation immediately rules out **(A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**. A precursor would be a different molecule with a different (usually lower) mass.\n    *   This also rules out **(B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**. This side reaction would create a larger molecule with a higher mass.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data**\n\n*   **Observation:** The two isomers are separated into two distinct peaks by liquid chromatography (LC). The ¹H NMR spectrum also shows two distinct peaks for a single proton.\n*   **Interpretation:** This means the two isomers have different physical and chemical properties. They interact differently with the LC column, allowing for their separation. Their protons exist in slightly different chemical environments, causing them to have different resonance frequencies (chemical shifts) in the NMR spectrum.\n*   **Evaluation of Remaining Isomer Types:**\n    *   **(D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they cannot be distinguished by standard ¹H NMR (they would show a single set of peaks) or separated by a standard (achiral) LC column (they would elute as a single peak). This option is inconsistent with the observation of two separate peaks in both techniques.\n    *   **(C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties. This difference means they are expected to have different NMR spectra and can be separated by standard chromatography. This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the observations.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence points to a single conclusion: the sample is a mixture of two compounds that have the same mass (isomers) but different physical properties, making them separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR. This is the definition of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\nIn the context of peptide chemistry, this is a common phenomenon that can arise from two main sources:\n1.  **Epimerization:** The inversion of a single chiral center (e.g., an L-amino acid flipping to a D-amino acid) during synthesis creates a diastereomer.\n2.  **Rotamers:** Restricted rotation around the amide (peptide) bond can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers. These conformers are a type of diastereomer and are often observed as separate species by NMR and LC.\n\nBoth scenarios result in a mixture of diastereoisomers, making this the only plausible explanation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\nThe most crucial piece of information is that the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks, but **both peaks have the same mass spectrum**, and this mass is consistent with the expected molecule.\n\n*   This tells us that the two chemical species being observed are **isomers**—they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass.\n*   This immediately rules out any explanation involving a molecule with a different mass.\n    *   **Option (B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor is a starting material or intermediate and would have a different (usually lower) molecular weight. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n    *   **Option (D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This side reaction would create a larger molecule with a higher molecular weight. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\nWe can confidently eliminate options (B) and (D). The problem is now reduced to identifying the correct type of isomerism.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data\nWe are left with two possibilities: enantiomers or diastereoisomers. The data shows that the two species are separable and distinguishable.\n\n*   **Observation:** The Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates the sample into two distinct peaks. The ¹H NMR spectrum also shows two distinct peaks for a single proton.\n*   **Implication:** This means the two isomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options based on this implication:\n\n*   **Option (A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have **identical** physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would not be separated by a standard LC column (they would elute as a single peak) and would be indistinguishable in a standard NMR experiment (producing a single set of signals). This option is inconsistent with the observation of two separate peaks in both the LC and NMR.\n\n*   **Option (C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. They have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n    *   Because they have different properties, they can be separated by standard LC, which explains the two LC peaks.\n    *   Because they are chemically distinct, they will have different NMR spectra, which explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n    *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the experimental data. In peptide chemistry, this is a common phenomenon, often caused by either the partial racemization of an amino acid's chiral center during synthesis or by the presence of stable *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) around a peptide bond.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only explanation that fits all the experimental observations is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. They are isomers (same mass), but they have different physical properties, allowing them to be separated by LC and distinguished by NMR.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\nThe problem states that LC-MS analysis shows two peaks, but both have the **same mass spectrum**, which is consistent with the expected molecule. This is a crucial piece of evidence. It tells us that the two species being observed are **isomers**—they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass.\n\nThis observation immediately allows us to eliminate options that involve a change in mass:\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor is a starting material or intermediate. It would have a different chemical formula and a different (usually lower) mass. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n*   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This implies a side reaction where an extra component (e.g., another amino acid) has been added. This would result in a product with a different (higher) mass. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data\nAfter Step 1, we are left with two possibilities: the compound is a mixture of enantiomers (A) or diastereoisomers (D). The LC and NMR data allow us to distinguish between these.\n\n*   **Observation:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the sample into two distinct peaks.\n*   **Observation:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton.\n\nThese observations tell us that the two isomers have **different physical and chemical properties** under standard analytical conditions.\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce a **single, overlapping peak** in a standard NMR spectrum and would **not separate** on a standard LC column (they would elute as a single peak). To distinguish them, special chiral conditions (e.g., a chiral LC column or a chiral NMR solvent) are required, which were not specified. This option is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have **different physical and chemical properties**.\n    *   Because they are chemically distinct, they are expected to have different NMR spectra, which explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n    *   Because they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, shape), they can be separated by standard chromatography techniques like LC, which explains the two peaks in the chromatogram.\n    *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all observations: the two species are isomers (same mass), but they are separable and distinguishable by standard analytical methods.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers. This is a common issue in peptide synthesis, where either epimerization of a chiral center or the presence of stable *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) around an amide bond can create a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided information to determine the most likely explanation.\n\n### **Analysis of the Experimental Data**\n\n1.  **LC-MS Data Analysis:**\n    *   **Observation:** The mass spectrometry (MS) data shows that both separated peaks have the same mass spectrum, and this mass is consistent with the expected molecule.\n    *   **Implication:** This is a critical piece of evidence. It proves that the two chemical species are **isomers**—they share the same molecular formula and weight. This immediately rules out any explanation involving a compound with a different mass.\n    *   **Ruling out options:**\n        *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate in the synthesis. It would have a different, likely lower, molecular weight. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n        *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This side reaction implies the addition of an extra amino acid or coupling agent, which would result in a product with a different, higher molecular weight. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR and LC Data Analysis:**\n    *   **Observation:** The crude compound is separated into two distinct peaks by liquid chromatography (LC), and the ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n    *   **Implication:** This means the two isomers have different physical and chemical properties, allowing them to be separated by chromatography and distinguished by NMR spectroscopy under standard (achiral) conditions.\n    *   **Ruling out the remaining option:**\n        *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard, achiral environment (like a typical NMR solvent or a standard LC column), they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce a single, overlapping peak in the NMR and would co-elute as a single peak in the LC. The observation of two separate peaks in both techniques definitively rules out enantiomers.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only remaining explanation that is consistent with all the experimental evidence is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n*   **Consistency with Data:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   Because they are chemically distinct, they give different NMR spectra, explaining the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n    *   Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard chromatography, explaining the two LC peaks.\n    *   As isomers, they have the same molecular formula and mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n\n*   **Plausibility in Peptide Synthesis:** This is a very common occurrence in peptide chemistry. Diastereomers can be formed either by the inversion of a stereocenter during the synthesis (epimerization) or, very commonly, by the presence of stable *cis* and *trans* isomers (rotamers) around a peptide bond. These rotamers are a specific type of diastereomer and are known to be separable and distinguishable by LC and NMR.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Analysis of the Experimental Observations\n\n1.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** The crude compound separates into two distinct peaks on the Liquid Chromatography (LC) column. This indicates the sample is a mixture of at least two different chemical species that have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, size, shape), allowing them to be separated.\n    *   **Observation:** Both peaks have the *same mass spectrum*, and this mass is consistent with the expected molecule. This is the most critical piece of evidence. It proves that the two separated species are **isomers**—they have the same molecular formula and mass but a different arrangement of atoms.\n    *   **Conclusion from LC-MS:** This data immediately rules out any explanation involving a change in molecular formula or mass.\n        *   **Ruled Out:** Contamination with a precursor (Option A) is incorrect because a precursor would have a different, likely lower, mass.\n        *   **Ruled Out:** 'Double coupling' (Option D) is incorrect because this side reaction would create a product with a different, higher, mass.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data in Conjunction with LC-MS:**\n    *   **Observation:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with roughly equal integrals. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this confirms the presence of two distinct molecular species in a ~1:1 ratio, where the alpha-proton exists in a slightly different chemical environment in each species.\n    *   **Remaining Options:** We are left to decide between a mixture of enantiomers (Option B) and a mixture of diastereoisomers (Option C).\n    *   **Evaluating Enantiomers (Option B):** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce a *single* set of peaks in a standard NMR experiment and would elute as a *single* peak on a standard LC column. This explanation is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data, which show two distinct peaks.\n    *   **Evaluating Diastereoisomers (Option C):** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   Their different chemical properties mean they are expected to have different NMR spectra, explaining the two distinct peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   Their different physical properties mean they can be separated by standard chromatography techniques, explaining the two distinct peaks in the LC.\n        *   As isomers, they have the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only explanation that is consistent with all the experimental evidence is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. The two species are isomers (same mass), but they are chemically and physically distinct, allowing them to be distinguished by NMR and separated by LC.
