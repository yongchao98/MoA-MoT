Identify the Reaction Mechanism**\nThe reaction of an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base like sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction. This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called a benzyne.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In the starting material, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both abstraction pathways, even though abstraction of H is kinetically favored over D (due to the kinetic isotope effect).\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nTherefore, two different benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the amino group the #1 position, the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack by the nucleophile at either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C2) followed by protonation leads to a single product.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The final product is **aniline**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find a total of three unique organic products:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nThe total number of possible organic products is 3.

Identify the Reaction Type**\nThe reaction of an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base like sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**. The key intermediate in this mechanism is a highly reactive species called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) from NaNH₂ acts as a base and abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways, resulting in two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is the faster pathway due to the **kinetic isotope effect** (C-H bonds are weaker and break more easily than C-D bonds). The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from C2. Although slower, this pathway is still possible. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 creates a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the strained triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (liquid ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two distinct products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When renumbered to give the amino group the #1 position, the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack by the nucleophile at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The resulting product is **aniline**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find that three unique organic products can be formed. These products are isotopomers and are chemically distinct.\n\nThe three possible products are:\n1.

Identify the Reaction Type**\nThe reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia. These are the classic conditions for a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe reaction is initiated by the amide ion (NH₂⁻), which acts as a strong base. It abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom that is *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon is bonded to a deuterium atom (D).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both abstraction events, even though H-abstraction is faster than D-abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-H bonds are weaker than C-D bonds).\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):**\n    1.

This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called benzyne.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr). The strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.

The resulting carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this step and remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. The resulting carbanion eliminates the bromide ion from C1.

Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom that is *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.

This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2.

This is the faster pathway due to the **kinetic isotope effect** (C-H bonds are weaker and break more easily than C-D bonds). The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from C2. Although slower, this pathway is still possible. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 creates a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule.

It abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom that is *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon is bonded to a deuterium atom (D).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both abstraction events, even though H-abstraction is faster than D-abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-H bonds are weaker than C-D bonds).\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched.\n    4.  This forms the intermediate **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this process.\n    4.  This forms the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃), which provides a regular hydrogen atom (H).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products:\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the amino group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is at position C3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The addition of the -NH₂ group followed by protonation results in **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**4.

The positions ortho to the bromine are C2 (bearing D) and C6 (bearing H).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base, and these conditions are characteristic of an **elimination-addition reaction** that proceeds through a **benzyne intermediate**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom ortho to the bromine leaving group. Since there are two different ortho positions (one with H, one with D), two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two distinct benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from the C6 position. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect). The subsequent elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron (D⁺) from the C2 position. Although slower, this pathway is still possible. The elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either C1 or C6 of the triple bond, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the amino group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *This pathway yields two distinct products.*\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack by NH₂⁻ at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The resulting product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n    *This pathway yields one distinct product.*\n\n**4.

This is the kinetically favored pathway due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker and breaks more easily than the C-D bond). The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains, forming **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base can also remove the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower but still possible.

Identify the Reaction Type**\nThe reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH₂). These conditions are characteristic of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds via a highly reactive intermediate called a **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) from NaNH₂ acts as a base, abstracting a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. The starting material has two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nSince there are two different abstractable atoms, two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two distinct benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. The resulting carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this step and remains on the ring. The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   *Note: Due to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond breaks more easily than the C-D bond, making this the major pathway. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider all pathways.*\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. The resulting carbanion eliminates the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate formed is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (liquid ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the amino group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is now at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack by the nucleophile at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The final product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism. To determine the number of possible organic products, we must analyze all possible reaction pathways.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type and Reactants:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This molecule has a bromine atom at C1 and a deuterium atom (D) at C2. The positions ortho (adjacent) to the bromine are C2 (which has a D) and C6 (which has a hydrogen, H).\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an exceptionally strong base.\n    *   **Mechanism:** These conditions favor an elimination-addition reaction through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base, abstracting a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the bromine leaving group. Since there are two different ortho positions (C2-D and C6-H), two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two distinct benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is the kinetically favored pathway due to the **kinetic isotope effect** (C-H bonds are weaker and break more readily than C-D bonds). The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** Although slower, the amide ion can also remove the deuteron from C2. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the strained triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond.\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When numbering the ring to give the amino group priority (at C1), the deuterium is at the C3 position. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *This pathway yields two distinct products.*\n\n    *   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):** This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium.\n        1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline**.\n        *This pathway yields one distinct product.*\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we identify three unique organic products. The relative amounts of these products would be influenced by the kinetic isotope effect, but all three are possible.\n\nThe possible products are:\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type**: The reaction of an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base like sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds via a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The reaction begins with the amide ion (NH₂⁻), a strong base, abstracting a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.
