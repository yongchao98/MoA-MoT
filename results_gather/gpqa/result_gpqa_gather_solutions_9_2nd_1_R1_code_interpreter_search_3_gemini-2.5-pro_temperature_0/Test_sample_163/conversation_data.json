This requires calculating the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_total_1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_total_2).\n\n2.  **Identify the Physical Principles:** The problem involves double-lined spectroscopic binary stars. The total mass of such a system is governed by a relationship derived from Kepler's Third Law, which connects the total mass (M_total), the orbital period (P), the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars (K₁ and K₂), and the inclination of the orbit (i). The formula is:\n    M_total = M₁ + M₂ = [P * (K₁ + K₂)³] / [2πG * sin³(i)]\n\n3.  **Analyze the Careful Points (Key Information):**\n    *   **Double-Lined Spectroscopic Binary:** The problem provides radial velocity amplitudes for both stars in each system (e.g., 10 km/s *and* 5 km/s for system_1), confirming they are double-lined systems. This means we must sum the velocity amplitudes (K₁ + K₂) for the calculation.\n    *   **\"Eclipsing\" Systems:** This is the most crucial piece of information. For eclipses to be observed, the orbital plane must be viewed nearly edge-on from Earth. This implies that the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n    *   **Simplification from Inclination:** When `i` ≈ 90°, then `sin(i)` ≈ 1, and therefore `sin³(i)` ≈ 1. This allows us to simplify the mass formula for the purpose of a ratio, as the `sin³(i)` term is effectively 1 for both systems and would cancel out. The relationship simplifies to a direct proportionality:\n        M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\n4.  **Set Up the Ratio Formula:** Based on the proportionality above, we can set up a ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2.

This requires calculating the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_total_1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_total_2).\n\n2.  **Identify the Physical Principles:** The problem involves double-lined spectroscopic binary stars. The total mass of such a system is governed by a relationship derived from Kepler's Third Law, which connects the total mass (M_total), the orbital period (P), the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars (K₁ and K₂), and the inclination of the orbit (i). The formula is:\n    M_total = M₁ + M₂ = [P * (K₁ + K₂)³] / [2πG * sin³(i)]\n\n3.  **Analyze the Careful Points (Key Information):**\n    *   **Double-Lined Spectroscopic Binary:** The problem provides radial velocity amplitudes for both stars in each system (e.g., 10 km/s *and* 5 km/s for system_1), confirming they are double-lined systems. This means we must sum the velocity amplitudes (K₁ + K₂) for the calculation.\n    *   **\"Eclipsing\" Systems:** This is the most crucial piece of information. For eclipses to be observed, the orbital plane must be viewed nearly edge-on from Earth. This implies that the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n    *   **Simplification from Inclination:** When `i` ≈ 90°, then `sin(i)` ≈ 1, and therefore `sin³(i)` ≈ 1. This allows us to simplify the mass formula for the purpose of a ratio, as the `sin³(i)` term is effectively 1 for both systems and would cancel out.

The governing equation, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K₁ + K₂)³ / sin³(i)\n\nwhere `G` is the gravitational constant and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Key Information\nA critical piece of information is that both systems are **eclipsing**. For eclipses to occur, the system's orbital plane must be viewed nearly edge-on from our perspective. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n\n*   If `i` ≈ 90°, then `sin(i)` ≈ 1, and therefore `sin³(i)` ≈ 1.\n\nThis simplifies the mass formula significantly, as the `sin³(i)` term can be ignored. The total mass (M) becomes directly proportional to the period (P) and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes (K_total = K₁ + K₂):\n\nM ∝ P * (K_total)³\n\n### Step 4: Set up the Mass Ratio\nWe can now set up the ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2. The constants of proportionality (like 1/(2πG)) will cancel out.\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³]\n\n### Step 5: Substitute Values and Calculate\nLet's gather the data and perform the calculation.\n\n*   **For System 1:**\n    *   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n    *   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total₁) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n*   **For System 2:**\n    *   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n    *   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total₂) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, plug these values into the ratio formula:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = (2 years / 1 year) * (15 km/s / 25 km/s)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\n### Step 6: Compare with Options and Conclude\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432.

Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This requires calculating the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_total_1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_total_2).\n\n### 2. Identify the Relevant Physics\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary star system, the total mass (M_total = m₁ + m₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves (K₁ and K₂) by the following formula, which is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n\nM_total = [P * (K₁ + K₂)³] / (2πG * sin³(i))\n\nwhere:\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n### 3. Analyze the \"Eclipsing\" Condition\nA critical piece of information is that both systems are **eclipsing**. For eclipses to be observed, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the stars. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n\nWhen `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and consequently `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This allows us to simplify the mass formula by removing the `sin³(i)` term, as it is equal to 1.\n\nThe simplified relationship shows that the total mass is directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\n### 4. Set Up the Mass Ratio\nWe need to find the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2. Using the proportionality above, the constants (like 1/2πG) will cancel out:\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [P₁ * (K₁_a + K₁_b)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_a + K₂_b)³]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P₁ / P₂) * [ (K₁_a + K₁_b) / (K₂_a + K₂_b) ]³\n\n### 5. Substitute Values and Calculate\nFirst, let's gather the data and calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system:\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n    *   Sum of velocities (K_total_1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n    *   Sum of velocities (K_total_2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, plug these values into the ratio formula. The units (years and km/s) will cancel out, so no conversion is needed.\n\nRatio = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\nRatio = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nRatio = 2 * (27 / 125)\nRatio = 54 / 125\nRatio = 0.432\n\n### 6.
