It possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with 1 equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. The exocyclic double bond is reduced preferentially.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 remains (R). The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Reaction:** Epoxidation of the remaining endocyclic double bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a crucial step. The existing stereocenter at C4, with its bulky isopropyl group, directs the m-CPBA to attack from the opposite face of the ring to minimize steric hindrance. This is called an *anti*-attack.\n    *   In the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing up).\n    *   Therefore, the m-CPBA will attack from the bottom face, placing the epoxide oxygen on a dash (pointing down). This is the major pathway.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** The epoxide formed has the oxygen on a dash. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges. Assigning the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters:\n    *   C4 remains **(R)**.\n    *   C1 becomes **(S)**. (Priorities: O > C2 > C6 > CH3. Lowest priority CH3 is on a wedge. The 1->2->3 path is clockwise, which normally means R, but since the lowest priority group is in front, the assignment is inverted to S).\n    *   C2 becomes **(R)**. (Priorities: O > C1 > C3 > H. Lowest priority H is on a wedge. The 1->2->3 path is counter-clockwise, which normally means S, but since the lowest priority group is in front, the assignment is inverted to R).\n    *   Thus, the major isomer of Product 2 is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile CH₃O⁻.\n*   **Reaction:** Base-catalyzed epoxide ring-opening, which proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism.\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked (C2). The attack is *anti* to the C-O bond.\n    *   The epoxide oxygen is on a dash. The methoxide attacks C2 from the opposite (wedge) side.\n    *   The configuration at C2, which was (R), is inverted to **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**. The C1-O bond opens to form a hydroxyl group (on a dash) after workup.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group at C1 is converted to a propionate ester.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect the stereochemistry of any chiral centers.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its name is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe major product formed in this reaction sequence is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. Let's compare this to the given options:\n\n*   **A) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This perfectly matches our derived major product.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and structure.\n*   C) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect structure; the ring double bond should not be present.\n*   D) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This product would result from a *syn*-addition across the epoxide, which is mechanistically incorrect for this reaction.\n\nSince the question asks for a valid structure of product 4 (which exists as a mixture), and the structure derived from the major reaction pathway is listed as an option, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, paying close attention to the stereochemical outcomes at each stage.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic). The stereocenter at C4 has the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with one equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. The exocyclic double bond is less substituted than the endocyclic one.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereochemistry at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), which forms an epoxide.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4, with its bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent will attack from the face *opposite* to the isopropyl group (*anti*-attack). This pathway produces the major diastereomer of the epoxide.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n    *   In the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing up).\n    *   The *anti*-attack by m-CPBA occurs from the bottom face, placing the epoxide oxygen on a dash (pointing down).\n    *   This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n    *   Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters (C1 and C2) gives the configuration **(1S, 2R, 4R)** for the major epoxide isomer.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a source of the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic ring-opening follows an Sₙ2 mechanism. The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n    *   The methoxide attacks C2, which has an (R) configuration in the epoxide. The configuration is inverted to **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C4 is unchanged as **(R)**.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not break any bonds to the chiral carbons. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the molecule is fully retained.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product retains the (1S, 2S, 4R) configuration. Its name is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which exists as a mixture. The structure derived from the major reaction pathway is a valid component of this mixture. Our analysis shows the major product is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\nComparing this to the options provided:\n*   **A) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This exactly matches our derived major product.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and stereochemistry.\n*   C) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This would result from an error in analyzing the epoxide opening step.\n*   D) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n\nThe correct answer is the structure corresponding to the major product of the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one inside the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Selectivity:** The reaction selectively reduces the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond. The exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced in preference to the endocyclic trisubstituted double bond.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected. Product 1 is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The existing stereocenter at C4 directs the epoxidation. The bulky isopropyl group (which has an (R) configuration, typically drawn on a wedge) blocks one face of the ring. The m-CPBA reagent will therefore attack from the opposite, less hindered face (*anti*-attack). This is the major pathway.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** The epoxide oxygen adds to the face *trans* to the isopropyl group (i.e., on a dash). A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the two new stereocenters (C1 and C2) reveals the major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile CH₃O⁻.\n*   **Mechanism:** Under basic conditions, the reaction is an Sₙ2 nucleophilic attack.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks C2.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks from the wedge side.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S). The configuration at C1 is retained as (S). The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group at C1 is converted to a propionate ester. This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not change the configuration of any stereocenters.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. The structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which exists as a mixture.

It possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is selective for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. The exocyclic double bond is more reactive than the endocyclic one. Therefore, the isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction forms an epoxide across the remaining double bond (C1-C2). The reaction is diastereoselective due to the existing stereocenter at C4. The bulky isopropyl group, which has an (R) configuration (conventionally drawn on a wedge), sterically hinders the top face of the ring. Consequently, the m-CPBA reagent attacks from the opposite, less hindered bottom face (*anti*-attack). This is the major pathway.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    *   The epoxide oxygen is added to the bottom face (dash).\n    *   This forces the substituents at C1 (methyl) and C2 (hydrogen) onto the top face (wedge).\n    *   We assign the absolute configuration using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules:\n        *   **C4:** Remains (R).\n        *   **C1:** Priorities are O > C2 > C6 > CH3. The path from O(1) to C2(2) to C6(3) is clockwise. The lowest priority group (CH3) is on a wedge, so the configuration is **(S)**.\n        *   **C2:** Priorities are O > C1 > C3 > H. The path from O(1) to C1(2) to C3(3) is clockwise. The lowest priority group (H) is on a wedge, so the configuration is **(S)**.\n    *   Therefore, the major isomer of Product 2 is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Analysis:** Under basic conditions, the ring-opening is an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary. Thus, the attack occurs at **C2**.\n    *   **Stereoselectivity:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked center (C2). The attack occurs from the face opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks from the wedge side.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 3 (Major Isomer):**\n    *   The configuration at C1 is retained: **(S)**. The C1-O bond opens to form a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The configuration at C2 is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n    *   The configuration at C4 is unchanged: **(R)**.\n    *   Therefore, the major isomer of Product 3 is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n*   **Analysis:** The hydroxyl group at C1 is converted to a propionate ester. This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect the stereochemistry of the chiral centers.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The stereochemistry is retained from Product 3.\n*   **Final Product Name:** **(1S, 2R, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe structure derived from the major reaction pathway is (1S, 2R, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\nB) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - **This matches our derived structure.**\nC) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and structure.\nD) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n\nThe question states that product 4 is a mixture, and we need to find one valid structure. Our analysis shows that the major product of the reaction sequence is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, highlighting the critical points for determining the final structure.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with only one equivalent of hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a crucial step. The existing chiral center at C4, bearing a bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent attacks from the face of the ring *opposite* to the isopropyl group (*anti*-attack). This is the major pathway.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** For the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is typically drawn on a wedge (pointing up). The *anti*-attack means the epoxide oxygen will be on a dash (pointing down). This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges. Applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to this major diastereomer gives the configuration **(1S, 2R, 4R)**.\n*   **Product 2 (major isomer):** (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic ring-opening follows an Sₙ2 mechanism. The nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the attack occurs at **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The methoxide attacks C2 from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks from the wedge side.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The configuration at C2, which was (R) in the epoxide, is inverted to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**. The configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n*   **Product 3 (major isomer):** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester. It occurs at the oxygen atom and does not break any bonds to the chiral carbons. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4 (major isomer):** The final product has the same stereochemistry as Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of the major reaction pathway leads to the structure (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. Comparing this to the given options:\n\n*   A) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and structure.\n*   B) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This matches the derived structure of the major product.\n*   C) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   D) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This structure has the wrong stereochemistry at C2, which would imply the epoxide opening occurred without the required inversion of configuration.\n\nSince the question asks for a valid structure and the product is a mixture, the major product is the most valid answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, highlighting the critical points for determining the final structure.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one inside the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).

This is known as substrate-controlled diastereoselection.\n    *   **Major Pathway:** The m-CPBA attacks from the face *anti* (opposite) to the isopropyl group. This leads to the major diastereomer of the epoxide (Product 2a).\n    *   **Minor Pathway:** A smaller amount of the epoxide is formed by attack from the *syn* face (the same side as the isopropyl group), leading to the minor diastereomer (Product 2b).\n*   **Product 2:** A mixture of two diastereomeric epoxides. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities reveals their stereochemistry:\n    *   **Major Epoxide (2a): (1R, 2S, 4R)**\n    *   **Minor Epoxide (2b): (1S, 2R, 4R)**\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (the mixture of epoxides).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.

Therefore, the attack occurs at **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The reaction is an Sₙ2 attack, which proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C2). The stereochemistry at C1 and C4 is retained.\n*   **Product 3 (mixture of alcohols):**\n    *   **From Major Epoxide (2a, 1R, 2S, 4R):** Attack at C2 inverts its configuration from (S) to (R). The resulting major alcohol (3a) is **(1R, 2R, 4R)**.\n    *   **From Minor Epoxide (2b, 1S, 2R, 4R):** Attack at C2 inverts its configuration from (R) to (S). The resulting minor alcohol (3b) is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3 (the mixture of alcohols).\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester.

The existing stereocenter at C4 directs the approach of the m-CPBA. The bulky isopropyl group (which is on a wedge in the (R) configuration) sterically blocks the top face of the ring. Therefore, the m-CPBA will attack from the opposite, less hindered bottom face (*anti*-attack). This is the major pathway.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** The epoxide oxygen is added to the bottom face (dash). This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 to the top face (wedge). A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities reveals the stereochemistry of this major epoxide to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The major epoxide isomer, (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide (Product 2).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a source of the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic ring-opening follows an Sₙ2 mechanism.

It possesses two double bonds: one is trisubstituted and endocyclic (within the ring), and the other is disubstituted and exocyclic (in the isopropenyl side chain).\n*   **Reagents & Conditions:** H₂ gas, Pd/C catalyst, consumption of 1 equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is selective for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. The exocyclic double bond is more reactive than the endocyclic one. Since only one equivalent of H₂ is used, only the exocyclic double bond is reduced.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is converted to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Analysis:** m-CPBA epoxidizes the remaining double bond at C1-C2. This reaction is diastereoselective due to the existing chiral center at C4. The bulky isopropyl group sterically hinders one face of the cyclohexene ring, forcing the m-CPBA to attack from the opposite, less hindered face. This is known as *anti*-attack and leads to the major product.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  In (R)-limonene, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing \"up\").\n    2.  The m-CPBA attacks from the *anti* face, so the epoxide oxygen will be on a dash (pointing \"down\").\n    3.  This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n    4.  Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the new stereocenters:\n        *   **C1:** The configuration is **(S)**. (Priorities: O > C2 > C6 > CH₃. The path is clockwise, but the lowest priority group is on a wedge, so the assignment is inverted to S).\n        *   **C2:** The configuration is **(R)**. (Priorities: O > C1 > C3 > H. The path is counter-clockwise, but the lowest priority group is on a wedge, so the assignment is inverted to R).\n    5.

C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  The methoxide attacks C2, which has an (R) configuration in the epoxide.\n    2.  The configuration at C2 is inverted from (R) to **(S)**.\n    3.  The configurations at C1 and C4 are retained as (S) and (R), respectively.\n    4.

It possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic). The stereocenter at C4 has the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with 1 equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Selectivity:** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. The exocyclic double bond is reduced preferentially.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group, while the endocyclic double bond and the stereocenter at C4 remain unchanged. Product 1 is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4, with its bulky isopropyl group, directs the m-CPBA to attack from the less hindered face of the ring. For the (R) configuration, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing up). Therefore, the m-CPBA will attack from the opposite face (*anti*-attack), placing the epoxide oxygen on a dash (pointing down). This is the major pathway.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    *   The epoxide oxygen is on a dash. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n    *   We assign the absolute configuration using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules:\n        *   **C4:** Unchanged, remains **(R)**.\n        *   **C1:** Priorities are O > C2 > C6 > CH₃. The path from O(1) to C2(2) to C6(3) is clockwise. The lowest priority group (CH₃) is on a wedge. For a wedged lowest-priority group, a clockwise path corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n        *   **C2:** Priorities are O > C1 > C3 > H. The path from O(1) to C1(2) to C3(3) is counter-clockwise. The lowest priority group (H) is on a wedge. For a wedged lowest-priority group, a counter-clockwise path corresponds to an **(R)** configuration.\n    *   Therefore, the major isomer of Product 2 is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a source of the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Regioselectivity:** Under basic conditions, the ring-opening follows an Sₙ2 mechanism. The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Thus, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked (C2). The attack must be *anti* to the C-O bond.\n    *   The C2-O bond is on a dash, so the methoxide attacks from the wedge side.\n    *   The configuration at C2 inverts from **(R)** to **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**. The C1-O bond breaks, and the oxygen (on a dash) becomes a hydroxyl group after workup.\n    *   The configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).

It has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with 1 equivalent of H₂ over Pd/C.\n*   **Selectivity:** The reaction selectively reduces the less substituted and more sterically accessible double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** This is a critical step. The existing chiral center at C4, with its bulky isopropyl group, directs the attack of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent attacks from the face of the ring *opposite* to the bulky group (*anti*-attack). This pathway forms the major product.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Major Epoxide (Product 2):**\n    *   For the (R) configuration, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge.\n    *   The *anti*-attack means the m-CPBA approaches from the dashed face.\n    *   The resulting epoxide oxygen is on a dash.

C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The Sₙ2 attack occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked center (C2). The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond.\n    *   The C2-O bond is on a dash, so the methoxide attacks from the wedge side.\n    *   The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C4 is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** The major alcohol isomer, (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol (Product 3).\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).

This structure matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct structure for product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂ gas and a Pd/C catalyst, with only one equivalent of H₂ being consumed.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. The exocyclic double bond is disubstituted, while the endocyclic one is trisubstituted. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), which forms an epoxide across the remaining double bond.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** This is a critical step. The reaction is diastereoselective due to the existing stereocenter at C4. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 (which has an (R) configuration, typically drawn on a wedge) sterically hinders the \"top\" face of the molecule. Consequently, the m-CPBA reagent will preferentially attack from the opposite, less hindered \"bottom\" face (*anti*-attack). This forms the major diastereomer of the epoxide.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):** The epoxide oxygen will be on a dash (trans to the wedged isopropyl group). This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities reveals the following absolute configurations: C4 remains (R), C1 becomes (S), and C2 becomes (R).\n*   **Product 2:** The major isomer is **(1S, 2R, 4R)**-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Mechanism:** Under basic conditions, the reaction is an Sₙ2 nucleophilic ring-opening.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide must attack C2 from the wedged side. This inverts the configuration at C2 from (R) to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n*   **Product 3:** The major alcohol isomer formed is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**Step 4: Steglich Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Steglich esterification, which converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the chiral centers. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which exists as a mixture. Our analysis followed the major reaction pathway at each step. The resulting major isomer of product 4 is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\nB) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and structure.\nC) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This matches our derived structure for the major product.\nD) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, highlighting the key points of stereochemistry and selectivity.\n\n### **Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the cyclohexene ring and a disubstituted one in the isopropenyl side chain.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with one equivalent of hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is faster for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond.

To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent will attack from the face *anti* (opposite) to the isopropyl group. This is the major reaction pathway.\n*   **Stereochemical Assignment:** Assuming the standard representation where the (R)-isopropyl group is on a wedge (pointing out of the page), the m-CPBA will attack from the dashed face (pointing into the page). This creates an epoxide ring on the dashed face and establishes the stereochemistry at the new chiral centers, C1 and C2. The major epoxide isomer formed (Product 2) has the absolute configuration **(1S, 2R, 4R)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic ring-opening (an Sₙ2 reaction) occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion (CH₃O⁻) attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. The attack occurs from the face opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide is on the dashed face, the methoxide attacks from the wedged face. The configuration at C2, which was (R) in the epoxide, is inverted to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n*   **Product 3:** The major alcohol isomer formed is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### **Step 4: Esterification**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester.

The existing stereocenter at C4, which has an (R) configuration and a bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent will attack from the face of the ring opposite to the isopropyl group (*anti*-attack). This is the major reaction pathway.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** Assuming the (R)-isopropyl group is on a wedge, the *anti*-attack places the epoxide oxygen on a dash.

The nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the attack occurs at **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It has two double bonds:\n    1.  A trisubstituted double bond within the ring (endocyclic).\n    2.  A disubstituted double bond in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂, Pd/C catalyst, 1 equivalent.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Analysis:** m-CPBA adds an oxygen atom across the C1=C2 double bond to form an epoxide. This is a diastereoselective reaction, meaning the existing stereocenter at C4 influences the stereochemical outcome.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The bulky isopropyl group at C4 (which has an (R) configuration, conventionally drawn on a wedge) sterically blocks one face of the ring. The m-CPBA reagent will therefore attack from the opposite, less hindered face (*anti*-attack). This is the major pathway.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):** The attack from the face *anti* to the wedged isopropyl group means the epoxide oxygen will be on a dash. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities reveals the absolute configuration of the major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)**-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Analysis:** Under basic conditions, the epoxide opening is an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the center of attack. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks C2 from the wedge side. This inverts the configuration at C2 from **(R) to (S)**. The configurations at C1 (S) and C4 (R) are retained.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂, Pd/C catalyst, 1 equivalent.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is selective for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. The exocyclic double bond is more reactive than the endocyclic one. Since only one equivalent of H₂ is used, only the exocyclic double bond is reduced.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is converted to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Analysis:** m-CPBA adds an oxygen atom across the C1=C2 double bond to form an epoxide. This is a diastereoselective reaction, meaning the existing stereocenter at C4 influences the stereochemical outcome.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The bulky isopropyl group at C4 (which has an (R) configuration, conventionally drawn on a wedge) sterically blocks one face of the ring. The m-CPBA reagent will therefore attack from the opposite, less hindered face (*anti*-attack). This is the major pathway.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):** The attack from the face *anti* to the wedged isopropyl group means the epoxide oxygen will be on a dash. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities reveals the absolute configuration of the major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)**-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Analysis:** Under basic conditions, the epoxide opening is an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the center of attack. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks C2 from the wedge side. This inverts the configuration at C2 from **(R) to (S)**. The configurations at C1 (S) and C4 (R) are retained.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction converts the tertiary alcohol at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom, and none of the bonds to the chiral carbons are broken. Therefore, the stereochemistry is fully retained.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which exists as a mixture.

It possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with 1 equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. The exocyclic double bond is reduced preferentially.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 remains (R). The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Reaction:** Epoxidation of the remaining endocyclic double bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a crucial step. The existing stereocenter at C4, with its bulky isopropyl group, directs the m-CPBA to attack from the opposite face of the ring to minimize steric hindrance. This is called an *anti*-attack.\n    *   In the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing up).\n    *   Therefore, the m-CPBA will attack from the bottom face, placing the epoxide oxygen on a dash (pointing down). This is the major pathway.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** The epoxide formed has the oxygen on a dash. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges. Assigning the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters:\n    *   C4 remains **(R)**.\n    *   C1 becomes **(S)**. (Priorities: O > C2 > C6 > CH3. Lowest priority CH3 is on a wedge. The 1->2->3 path is clockwise, which normally means R, but since the lowest priority group is in front, the assignment is inverted to S).\n    *   C2 becomes **(R)**. (Priorities: O > C1 > C3 > H.

The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), which forms an epoxide.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4, with its bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent will attack from the face *opposite* to the isopropyl group (*anti*-attack). This pathway produces the major diastereomer of the epoxide.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n    *   In the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing up).\n    *   The *anti*-attack by m-CPBA occurs from the bottom face, placing the epoxide oxygen on a dash (pointing down).\n    *   This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n    *   Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters (C1 and C2) gives the configuration **(1S, 2R, 4R)** for the major epoxide isomer.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a source of the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic ring-opening follows an Sₙ2 mechanism. The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n    *   The methoxide attacks C2, which has an (R) configuration in the epoxide. The configuration is inverted to **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C4 is unchanged as **(R)**.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not break any bonds to the chiral carbons. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the molecule is fully retained.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product retains the (1S, 2S, 4R) configuration. Its name is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which exists as a mixture. The structure derived from the major reaction pathway is a valid component of this mixture. Our analysis shows the major product is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\nComparing this to the options provided:\n*   **A) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This exactly matches our derived major product.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and stereochemistry.\n*   C) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This would result from an error in analyzing the epoxide opening step.\n*   D) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n\nThe correct answer is the structure corresponding to the major product of the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one inside the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Selectivity:** The reaction selectively reduces the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond. The exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced in preference to the endocyclic trisubstituted double bond.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected. Product 1 is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The existing stereocenter at C4 directs the epoxidation. The bulky isopropyl group (which has an (R) configuration, typically drawn on a wedge) blocks one face of the ring. The m-CPBA reagent will therefore attack from the opposite, less hindered face (*anti*-attack). This is the major pathway.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** The epoxide oxygen adds to the face *trans* to the isopropyl group (i.e., on a dash). A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the two new stereocenters (C1 and C2) reveals the major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile CH₃O⁻.\n*   **Mechanism:** Under basic conditions, the reaction is an Sₙ2 nucleophilic attack.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks C2.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks from the wedge side.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S). The configuration at C1 is retained as (S). The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group at C1 is converted to a propionate ester. This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not change the configuration of any stereocenters.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. The structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which exists as a mixture.

This is the major pathway.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    *   For the (R) configuration, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge.\n    *   The *anti*-attack means the m-CPBA approaches from the dashed face.

It possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is selective for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. The exocyclic double bond is more reactive than the endocyclic one. Therefore, the isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction forms an epoxide across the remaining double bond (C1-C2). The reaction is diastereoselective due to the existing stereocenter at C4. The bulky isopropyl group, which has an (R) configuration (conventionally drawn on a wedge), sterically hinders the top face of the ring. Consequently, the m-CPBA reagent attacks from the opposite, less hindered bottom face (*anti*-attack). This is the major pathway.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    *   The epoxide oxygen is added to the bottom face (dash).\n    *   This forces the substituents at C1 (methyl) and C2 (hydrogen) onto the top face (wedge).\n    *   We assign the absolute configuration using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules:\n        *   **C4:** Remains (R).\n        *   **C1:** Priorities are O > C2 > C6 > CH3. The path from O(1) to C2(2) to C6(3) is clockwise. The lowest priority group (CH3) is on a wedge, so the configuration is **(S)**.\n        *   **C2:** Priorities are O > C1 > C3 > H. The path from O(1) to C1(2) to C3(3) is clockwise. The lowest priority group (H) is on a wedge, so the configuration is **(S)**.\n    *   Therefore, the major isomer of Product 2 is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Analysis:** Under basic conditions, the ring-opening is an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary. Thus, the attack occurs at **C2**.\n    *   **Stereoselectivity:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked center (C2). The attack occurs from the face opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks from the wedge side.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 3 (Major Isomer):**\n    *   The configuration at C1 is retained: **(S)**.

The existing chiral center at C4, bearing a bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent attacks from the face of the ring *opposite* to the isopropyl group (*anti*-attack). This is the major pathway.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** For the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is typically drawn on a wedge (pointing up). The *anti*-attack means the epoxide oxygen will be on a dash (pointing down). This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.

This leads to the major diastereomer of the epoxide (Product 2a).\n    *   **Minor Pathway:** A smaller amount of the epoxide is formed by attack from the *syn* face (the same side as the isopropyl group), leading to the minor diastereomer (Product 2b).\n*   **Product 2:** A mixture of two diastereomeric epoxides. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities reveals their stereochemistry:\n    *   **Major Epoxide (2a): (1R, 2S, 4R)**\n    *   **Minor Epoxide (2b): (1S, 2R, 4R)**\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (the mixture of epoxides).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the attack occurs at **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The reaction is an Sₙ2 attack, which proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C2). The stereochemistry at C1 and C4 is retained.\n*   **Product 3 (mixture of alcohols):**\n    *   **From Major Epoxide (2a, 1R, 2S, 4R):** Attack at C2 inverts its configuration from (S) to (R). The resulting major alcohol (3a) is **(1R, 2R, 4R)**.\n    *   **From Minor Epoxide (2b, 1S, 2R, 4R):** Attack at C2 inverts its configuration from (R) to (S). The resulting minor alcohol (3b) is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3 (the mixture of alcohols).\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. It occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the chiral centers. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4 (mixture of esters):**\n    *   **Major Isomer (4a): (1R, 2R, 4R)**-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n    *   **Minor Isomer (4b): (1S, 2S, 4R)**-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which is a mixture. We must check which of our mechanistically derived products is present in the options.\n\n*   A) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This stereochemistry is not produced by the reaction mechanism.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This has incorrect numbering and structure.\n*   C) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - This has an incorrect carbon skeleton.\n*   D) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This perfectly matches the structure of the minor isomer (4b) derived from our analysis.\n\nSince the question asks for *a* valid structure from the product mixture, and the minor product is listed as an option, this is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, highlighting the key points for determining the final structure.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one inside the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic). The stereocenter at C4 has the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with only one equivalent of hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is faster for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a crucial step. The existing stereocenter at C4 directs the approach of the m-CPBA. The bulky isopropyl group (which is on a wedge in the (R) configuration) sterically blocks the top face of the ring. Therefore, the m-CPBA will attack from the opposite, less hindered bottom face (*anti*-attack). This is the major pathway.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** The epoxide oxygen is added to the bottom face (dash). This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 to the top face (wedge). A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities reveals the stereochemistry of this major epoxide to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The major epoxide isomer, (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide (Product 2).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a source of the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic ring-opening follows an Sₙ2 mechanism. The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on the bottom face (dash), the methoxide attacks C2 from the top face (wedge).\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):**\n    *   The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C2 is inverted from (R) to **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C4 is retained as **(R)**.\n    *   The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The major alcohol isomer, (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol (Product 3).\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the existing stereocenters. The configuration is retained.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe major product formed through this reaction sequence is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. Comparing this to the given options:\n\n*   **A) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This matches our derived structure for the major product.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and substitution pattern.\n*   C) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer; the ring double bond should have been removed.\n*   D) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This is a diastereomer of the major product.\n\nSince the question asks for a valid structure of product 4 (which exists as a mixture), and the major product is listed as an option, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It possesses two double bonds: one is trisubstituted and endocyclic (within the ring), and the other is disubstituted and exocyclic (in the isopropenyl side chain).\n*   **Reagents & Conditions:** H₂ gas, Pd/C catalyst, consumption of 1 equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is selective for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. The exocyclic double bond is more reactive than the endocyclic one. Since only one equivalent of H₂ is used, only the exocyclic double bond is reduced.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is converted to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Analysis:** m-CPBA epoxidizes the remaining double bond at C1-C2. This reaction is diastereoselective due to the existing chiral center at C4. The bulky isopropyl group sterically hinders one face of the cyclohexene ring, forcing the m-CPBA to attack from the opposite, less hindered face. This is known as *anti*-attack and leads to the major product.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  In (R)-limonene, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing \"up\").\n    2.  The m-CPBA attacks from the *anti* face, so the epoxide oxygen will be on a dash (pointing \"down\").\n    3.  This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n    4.  Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the new stereocenters:\n        *   **C1:** The configuration is **(S)**. (Priorities: O > C2 > C6 > CH₃. The path is clockwise, but the lowest priority group is on a wedge, so the assignment is inverted to S).\n        *   **C2:** The configuration is **(R)**. (Priorities: O > C1 > C3 > H. The path is counter-clockwise, but the lowest priority group is on a wedge, so the assignment is inverted to R).\n    5.  The major isomer of Product 2 is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Analysis:** Under basic conditions, epoxide opening is an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon. C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  The methoxide attacks C2, which has an (R) configuration in the epoxide.\n    2.  The configuration at C2 is inverted from (R) to **(S)**.\n    3.  The configurations at C1 and C4 are retained as (S) and (R), respectively.\n    4.  The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the chiral centers.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The stereochemistry is retained from Product 3. The final product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe major product formed in this reaction sequence is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. Comparing this to the given options:\n\n*   A) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   B) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n*   C) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - **This matches the derived structure of the major product.**\n*   D) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer (wrong numbering).\n\nSince the question asks for a valid structure and the major product is listed as an option, this is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic). The stereocenter at C4 has the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with 1 equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Selectivity:** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. The exocyclic double bond is reduced preferentially.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group, while the endocyclic double bond and the stereocenter at C4 remain unchanged. Product 1 is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4, with its bulky isopropyl group, directs the m-CPBA to attack from the less hindered face of the ring. For the (R) configuration, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing up). Therefore, the m-CPBA will attack from the opposite face (*anti*-attack), placing the epoxide oxygen on a dash (pointing down). This is the major pathway.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    *   The epoxide oxygen is on a dash. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges.\n    *   We assign the absolute configuration using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules:\n        *   **C4:** Unchanged, remains **(R)**.\n        *   **C1:** Priorities are O > C2 > C6 > CH₃. The path from O(1) to C2(2) to C6(3) is clockwise. The lowest priority group (CH₃) is on a wedge. For a wedged lowest-priority group, a clockwise path corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n        *   **C2:** Priorities are O > C1 > C3 > H. The path from O(1) to C1(2) to C3(3) is counter-clockwise. The lowest priority group (H) is on a wedge.

This structure matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct structure for product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂ gas and a Pd/C catalyst, with only one equivalent of H₂ being consumed.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. The exocyclic double bond is disubstituted, while the endocyclic one is trisubstituted. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), which forms an epoxide across the remaining double bond.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** This is a critical step. The reaction is diastereoselective due to the existing stereocenter at C4. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 (which has an (R) configuration, typically drawn on a wedge) sterically hinders the \"top\" face of the molecule. Consequently, the m-CPBA reagent will preferentially attack from the opposite, less hindered \"bottom\" face (*anti*-attack). This forms the major diastereomer of the epoxide.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):** The epoxide oxygen will be on a dash (trans to the wedged isopropyl group). This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities reveals the following absolute configurations: C4 remains (R), C1 becomes (S), and C2 becomes (R).\n*   **Product 2:** The major isomer is **(1S, 2R, 4R)**-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Mechanism:** Under basic conditions, the reaction is an Sₙ2 nucleophilic ring-opening.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide must attack C2 from the wedged side. This inverts the configuration at C2 from (R) to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n*   **Product 3:** The major alcohol isomer formed is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**Step 4: Steglich Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Steglich esterification, which converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the chiral centers. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4, which exists as a mixture. Our analysis followed the major reaction pathway at each step. The resulting major isomer of product 4 is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\nB) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and structure.\nC) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This matches our derived structure for the major product.\nD) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, highlighting the key points of stereochemistry and selectivity.\n\n### **Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the cyclohexene ring and a disubstituted one in the isopropenyl side chain.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with one equivalent of hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is faster for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic (isopropenyl) double bond is selectively reduced.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n### **Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** The existing chiral center at C4, which bears a bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent will attack from the face *anti* (opposite) to the isopropyl group. This is the major reaction pathway.\n*   **Stereochemical Assignment:** Assuming the standard representation where the (R)-isopropyl group is on a wedge (pointing out of the page), the m-CPBA will attack from the dashed face (pointing into the page). This creates an epoxide ring on the dashed face and establishes the stereochemistry at the new chiral centers, C1 and C2. The major epoxide isomer formed (Product 2) has the absolute configuration **(1S, 2R, 4R)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic ring-opening (an Sₙ2 reaction) occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion (CH₃O⁻) attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. The attack occurs from the face opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide is on the dashed face, the methoxide attacks from the wedged face. The configuration at C2, which was (R) in the epoxide, is inverted to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n*   **Product 3:** The major alcohol isomer formed is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### **Step 4: Esterification**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the existing chiral centers. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe structure derived from the major reaction pathway is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. Comparing this to the given options:\n\n*   A) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n*   B) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   C) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and stereochemistry.\n*   D) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - **This matches the derived structure of the major product.**\n\nAlthough the question mentions that product 4 is a mixture, one of the options corresponds to the major product of the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis to determine the correct structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the cyclohexene ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the isopropenyl side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with one equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) to form an epoxide across the remaining double bond (C1-C2).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** The reaction is diastereoselective. The existing stereocenter at C4, which has an (R) configuration and a bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent will attack from the face of the ring opposite to the isopropyl group (*anti*-attack). This is the major reaction pathway.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** Assuming the (R)-isopropyl group is on a wedge, the *anti*-attack places the epoxide oxygen on a dash. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto wedges. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters reveals the major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)**-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic ring-opening follows an Sₙ2 mechanism. The nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the attack occurs at **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The attack occurs from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen in the major isomer is on a dash, the methoxide attacks C2 from the wedge side.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 3:** The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to **(S)**. The configurations at C1 (S) and C4 (R) are retained. The resulting alcohol, Product 3, is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP in a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the chiral centers.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 4:** The stereochemistry of Product 3 is retained. The final product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe structure derived from the major reaction pathway is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. Comparing this to the given options:\n\n*   A) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate\n*   B) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate\n*   C) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate\n*   D) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate\n\nThe derived structure matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, highlighting the key decision points and stereochemical outcomes.\n\n### **Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Reaction:** (R)-(+)-Limonene is treated with one equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the cyclohexene ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the isopropenyl side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is faster for less sterically hindered and less substituted double bonds. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond is selectively reduced. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n### **Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Analysis:** The m-CPBA adds an oxygen atom across the remaining double bond (C1-C2) to form an epoxide (Product 2).\n*   **Careful Point (Diastereoselectivity):** This is the most critical step for determining the final stereochemistry. The existing chiral center at C4 has a bulky isopropyl group. To minimize steric hindrance, the m-CPBA reagent will attack from the face of the ring *opposite* to this bulky group. This is called an *anti*-attack and forms the major diastereomer.\n    *   In (R)-limonene, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing out of the page).\n    *   Therefore, the m-CPBA attacks from the dashed face (pointing into the page). The resulting epoxide oxygen will be on a **dash**.\n    *   This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 onto **wedges**.\n*   **Product 2 (Stereochemistry):** Assigning the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the new stereocenters (C1 and C2) of this major epoxide gives the configuration **(1S, 2R, 4R)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Analysis:** Under basic conditions, the epoxide opening is an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** The nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. The methoxide attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond.\n    *   The epoxide oxygen is on a **dash**, so the methoxide attacks C2 from the **wedge** side.\n    *   The configuration at C2, which was **(R)**, is inverted to **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**. The C1-O bond opens to form a hydroxyl group on a dash.\n*   **Product 3:** The major product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### **Step 4: Esterification**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Steglich esterification, which converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect the configuration of any of the chiral centers.\n*   **Product 4:** The stereochemistry of Product 3 is retained. The final major product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe structure derived from the major reaction pathway is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.
