Deconstruction of the Physics Problem\nThe core of the problem is to find a detector resolution, which is a distance, based on the decay properties of a relativistic particle.\n\n*   **Given Data:**\n    *   Particle: $X^0$\n    *   Proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$): $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Total energy in lab frame (E): 27 GeV\n    *   Rest mass of $X^0$ ($m_0c^2$): 3.41 GeV\n*   **Condition:** The detector must be able to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Observing a Decay\":** For a decay to be observed, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution ($d_{res}$).\n*   **Goal:** Find the minimum required resolution, $d_{res}$.\n\n### 2. Required Calculations\nThe solution involves a sequence of calculations based on special relativity and particle decay statistics.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor quantifies the relativistic effects. It's the ratio of the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length in the Lab Frame ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. It accounts for both time dilation and the particle's velocity. A precise formula is:\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\nPlugging in the values:\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{62.69 - 1} \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot 7.854$\n$\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\nThis calculation is performed consistently across nearly all agents.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Observation Condition**\nThe fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than the resolution $d_{res}$ is given by the exponential decay law: $P(\\text{distance} > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$.\nThe condition is that this fraction must be at least 30%:\n$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n### 3. Analysis of the \"Minimum Resolution\" and \"30%\"\nThis is the key point where the agents' interpretations diverge slightly, but all lead to the same conclusion.\n\n*   **Interpretation A (Strict 30%):** We find the maximum possible resolution that satisfies the condition by solving the equality:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot 1.204 \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n    This value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is the coarsest the resolution can be. Any resolution *better* (i.e., smaller) than this is acceptable. Of the options, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is the only one that is both close to this value and satisfies the condition ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$).\n\n*   **Interpretation B (1/3 Hypothesis):** In physics problems with multiple-choice answers, round percentages like \"30%\" are often approximations for simple fractions. Testing the hypothesis that the intended fraction is $1/3$ (which is ~33.3%) is a standard problem-solving technique.\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n    $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n    This calculated value is an almost perfect match for the option $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This provides very strong evidence that this was the intended solution path.\n\n### 4. Synthesis of Agent Answers\nDespite some confusion in the lettering of the options within their individual responses, every single agent correctly identified the physics, performed the calculation, and concluded that the correct numerical answer is **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. The agents who used Interpretation B arrived at this answer most directly. The agents who used Interpretation A also correctly identified it as the only plausible choice.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe calculation, especially under the well-justified \"1/3 hypothesis\", points directly to the value $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This value corresponds to option A in the question's provided list.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physics and the Goal\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a relativistic particle.\n*   **Observation Condition:** A decay is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance, $x$, greater than the detector's resolution, $d$.\n*   **Decay Law:** The fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than $d$ before decaying is given by the exponential decay law: $P(x > d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the resolution $d$ that satisfies the condition $e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$. This sets an upper limit on the resolution: $d \\le -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$. The question asks for the required resolution, and we must find which of the given options is the intended answer.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\nFirst, we must calculate the mean decay length of the particle in the bubble chamber (the lab frame).\n\n*   **Given Values:**\n    *   Total Energy ($E$) = 27 GeV\n    *   Rest Mass Energy ($m_0c^2$) = 3.41 GeV\n    *   Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$) = $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Speed of Light ($c$) $\\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n    The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy to the rest mass energy.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Relativistic Momentum ($pc$)**\n    We use the energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n    The most precise formula for the mean decay length is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Required Resolution ($d$)\nNow we apply the observation condition.\n\n*   **Using the 30% Condition Literally:**\n    We solve for the boundary case: $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$.\n    $d = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n    This value is the maximum permissible resolution. The closest option is D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), which is a valid resolution since it is less than the calculated maximum.\n\n*   **Using the \"1/3 Hypothesis\":**\n    In physics problems, percentages like 30% are often approximations for simple fractions. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended condition was to observe at least $1/3$ of the decays.\n    We solve for the boundary case: $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    $d = -\\lambda \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\ln(3)$\n    $d \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (1.0986) \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 4. Final Decision\nThe calculation using the \"1/3 hypothesis\" yields a result of $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This value is an extremely close match to option D.\n\n*   **Calculated Value:** $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n*   **Option D:** $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThe difference is less than 0.5%, which is negligible and can be attributed to the rounding of the initial constants in the problem statement. The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis task requires a multi-step calculation based on the principles of special relativity and particle decay. I will first outline the plan and then execute it with Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The particle is moving at relativistic speeds. The Lorentz factor relates its total energy (E) in the lab frame to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$). The formula is $\\gamma = E / (m_0c^2)$.\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: In the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is dilated by the factor $\\gamma$. The average distance it travels before decaying, known as the mean decay length ($\\lambda$), can be calculated. A precise formula is $\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime.\n3.  **Apply the Decay Condition**: The problem asks for the minimum resolution, $d$, needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. A decay is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the resolution $d$. The fraction of particles that travel at least a distance $d$ is given by the exponential decay law: $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$.\n4.  **Solve for the Resolution ($d$)**: We need to solve the inequality $e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$. The boundary condition gives the largest possible resolution that satisfies the requirement: $d = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.3)$.\n5.  **Refine the Calculation**: In physics problems, a percentage like \"30%\" is often an approximation for a simple fraction. The value $1/3 \\approx 33.3\\%$ is very close to 30% and often leads to a cleaner answer that matches one of the options. I will calculate the resolution for the condition of observing at least $1/3$ of the decays, which means solving $d = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$. This result is expected to be a very close match to one of the options.\n6.  **Compare and Conclude**: The calculated value for $d$ will be compared against the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the given constants\nE = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0 = 3.41 # Rest mass in GeV\ntau0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458.0  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = E / m0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in the lab frame\n# The formula is lambda = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nmean_decay_length = c * tau0 * np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the required resolution (d)\n# The condition is to observe at least 30% of decays.\n# It is highly likely that 30% is an approximation for the fraction 1/3.\n# We solve the boundary condition for observing 1/3 of decays: d = lambda * ln(3)\nresolution = mean_decay_length * np.log(3)\n\n# Step 5: Print the result and compare with the options\nprint(f\"The calculated mean decay length is: {mean_decay_length:.4e} m\")\nprint(f\"The required resolution is: {resolution:.4e} m\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 2.08e-1 m\")\nprint(f\"B) 2.08e-3 m\")\nprint(f\"C) 2.08e-6 m\")\nprint(f\"D) 2.08e-9 m\")\n\n# The calculated value of ~2.07e-6 m is extremely close to option C.\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated resolution is approximately 2.07e-6 m, which matches option C.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated mean decay length is: 1.8838e-06 m\nThe required resolution is: 2.0695e-06 m\n\nComparing with the options:\nA) 2.08e-1 m\nB) 2.08e-3 m\nC) 2.08e-6 m\nD) 2.08e-9 m\n\nThe calculated resolution is approximately 2.07e-6 m, which matches option C.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$. In the context of a particle detector, \"observing\" a decay means that the particle leaves a track of a certain length before it decays. This track length must be greater than the detector's spatial resolution. Therefore, we need to find the resolution, let's call it $d$, such that the probability of the particle traveling a distance greater than $d$ is at least 30%.\n\n**2. Identify Key Physical Principles**\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle's energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must use relativistic formulas for time and length.\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor quantifies the relativistic effects. It's the ratio of the total energy ($E$) to the rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n*   **Time Dilation and Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The particle's lifetime in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). This leads to a longer average travel distance in the lab, known as the mean decay length ($\\lambda$).\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(x' \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n\n**3.

This provides strong evidence that D is the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\n*   **Relativistic Particle:** The particle $X^0$ has a total energy (27 GeV) much larger than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), which means it is traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light. We must use the principles of special relativity.\n*   **Time Dilation and Decay Length:** Due to its high speed, the particle's lifetime as observed in the laboratory frame (the Bubble Chamber) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). This is called time dilation. Consequently, the average distance it travels before decaying, known as the mean decay length ($\\lambda$), is also increased.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of particles is a random process. The fraction of particles that travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law: $P(x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n*   **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must leave a track longer than the detector's resolution, let's call it $d$. The problem requires that at least 30% of the decays are observed. This gives us the condition: $P(\\text{distance} > d) \\ge 0.30$, which translates to $e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n\n**2.

Understand the Physical Principles\nThe problem requires finding the detector resolution needed to observe a certain fraction of decays of a relativistic particle. The key concepts are:\n*   **Special Relativity**: The particle is moving at high energy, so its lifetime as observed in the laboratory (the Bubble Chamber) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime). This is due to time dilation.\n*   **Decay Length**: The increased lifetime in the lab frame means the particle travels, on average, a longer distance before decaying. This average distance is the mean decay length.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law**: The decay of particles is a random process. The fraction of particles that travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by an exponential function `P(x) = exp(-L_d / L_m)`, where `L_d` is the distance traveled and `L_m` is the mean decay length.\n*   **Detector Resolution**: To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must leave a track longer than the detector's resolution. Therefore, the resolution `d` must be such that the probability of the particle traveling a distance greater than `d` is at least 30%.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m₀c²).\n*   Total Energy, E = 27 GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy, m₀c² = 3.41 GeV\n*   γ = E / m₀c² = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L) in the Lab Frame**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. A precise formula uses the particle's momentum.\n*   First, find the momentum term `pc` from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)².\n    pc = √(E² - (m₀c²)²) = √(27² - 3.41²) = √(717.3719) ≈ 26.78 GeV\n*   The mean decay length `L` is given by `L = (pc / m₀c²) * c * τ₀`.\n    *   Proper lifetime, τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s\n    *   Speed of light, c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   L = (26.78 / 3.41) * (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s) ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Required Resolution (d)**\nThe condition is that at least 30% of decays are observed. This means the probability of the decay length being greater than the resolution `d` must be at least 0.30.\n*   P(decay length > d) = e^(-d/L) ≥ 0.30\n\nTo find the required resolution, we can solve for the boundary condition `e^(-d/L) = 0.30`.\n*   -d/L = ln(0.30) ≈ -1.204\n*   d = 1.204 * L ≈ 1.204 * (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\nThis value, `d ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`, represents the coarsest (largest) resolution that can still observe at least 30% of the decays. Any detector with a resolution `d_res ≤ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m` will satisfy the condition.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Options and Conclusion\n\nThe provided options are:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n\nOur calculated threshold is `2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`. Option C, `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m`, is a valid resolution because it is less than the calculated threshold. The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude.\n\n**Reconciling the small numerical difference:**\nThe discrepancy between our calculated threshold (2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m) and the closest option (2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m) is common in such problems. It often suggests that a round percentage like \"30%\" is an approximation for a simple fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended fraction was 1/3 (≈33.3%).\n*   e^(-d/L) = 1/3\n*   -d/L = ln(1/3) = -ln(3) ≈ -1.0986\n*   d = 1.0986 * L ≈ 1.0986 * (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) ≈ 2.07 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\nThis result, `2.07 × 10⁻⁶ m`, is an almost perfect match for option C, `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m`. This confirms that C is the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Principles\nThe problem involves a relativistic particle, so we must use concepts from special relativity. The key steps are:\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) to account for relativistic effects.\n*   Calculate the mean decay length (λ) of the particle in the laboratory's frame of reference. This is the average distance the particle travels before decaying.\n*   Use the exponential decay law to find the detector resolution (`d`) required to observe a certain fraction of the decays.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 2a: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m₀c²).\n*   Total Energy, E = 27 GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy, m₀c² = 3.41 GeV\n\nγ = E / (m₀c²) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.91789\n\n**Step 2b: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\nThe mean decay length in the lab frame is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. It can be calculated using the proper lifetime (τ₀), the speed of light (c), and the Lorentz factor (γ). A precise formula is:\nλ = c ⋅ τ₀ ⋅ √(γ² - 1)\n\n*   Proper Lifetime, τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s\n*   Speed of Light, c ≈ 2.998 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   Lorentz Factor, γ ≈ 7.91789\n\nλ = (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s) ⋅ √(7.91789² - 1)\nλ ≈ (2.3984 × 10⁻⁷ m) ⋅ √(62.693 - 1)\nλ ≈ (2.3984 × 10⁻⁷ m) ⋅ (7.8545)\nλ ≈ 1.884 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n**Step 2c: Determine the Required Resolution (d)**\nA decay is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution, `d`. The fraction of particles that travel at least a distance `d` is given by the exponential decay law:\nP(distance ≥ d) = e^(-d/λ)\n\nThe problem requires observing *at least 30%* of the decays:\ne^(-d/λ) ≥ 0.30\n\nTo find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition, which gives the largest possible resolution `d` that still satisfies the requirement.\ne^(-d/λ) = 0.30\n-d/λ = ln(0.30)\nd = -λ ⋅ ln(0.30) ≈ - (1.884 × 10⁻⁶ m) ⋅ (-1.204)\nd ≈ 2.268 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### 3. Analysis and Comparison with Options\n\nThe calculation shows that the resolution must be `d ≤ 2.268 × 10⁻⁶ m`. Any detector with a resolution smaller than or equal to this value will observe at least 30% of the decays.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect by several orders of magnitude. Option A, `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m`, is the only plausible choice. It satisfies the condition, as `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m` is indeed less than the calculated threshold of `2.268 × 10⁻⁶ m`.\n\n**Note on the Discrepancy:** The small difference between the calculated threshold (2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m) and the correct option (2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m) is very common in physics problems. It often arises because the problem's numbers are chosen so that an approximation (like \"30%\" being a substitute for the fraction \"1/3\") leads to a clean answer. If we re-calculate using the condition `e^(-d/λ) = 1/3`, we get:\nd = λ ⋅ ln(3) ≈ (1.884 × 10⁻⁶ m) ⋅ (1.0986) ≈ 2.070 × 10⁻⁶ m.\nThis result is extremely close to option A, confirming it is the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle $X^0$. In the context of a particle detector, \"observing\" a decay means that the particle leaves a track of a certain length before it decays.

This value matches option A almost perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the approaches from the candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal and Physical Principles**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle, $X^0$. This involves several key concepts from relativistic physics:\n\n*   **Relativistic Motion:** The particle's energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so it is moving at a speed very close to the speed of light. We must use special relativity.\n*   **Time Dilation:** Due to its high speed, the particle's lifetime as measured in the laboratory frame (the Bubble Chamber) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). This dilated lifetime is given by $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Mean Decay Length:** The average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying is called the mean decay length, denoted by $L$ or $\\lambda$.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of particles is a random process. The fraction of particles that travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by the formula $P(x) = e^{-x/L}$.\n*   **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must leave a track longer than the detector's resolution, let's call it $d$. Therefore, we need to find the resolution $d$ such that the probability of the track length being greater than $d$ is at least 30%.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 2.1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy.\n*   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.91789$\n\n**Step 2.2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L$)**\nThe mean decay length in the lab frame is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. It can be calculated using the formula:\n$L = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime.\n\n*   $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $\\gamma \\approx 7.91789$\n\n$L = (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.91789)^2 - 1}$\n$L \\approx (2.3984 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{62.692 - 1}$\n$L \\approx (2.3984 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (7.8544) \\approx 1.8838 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 2.3: Determine the Required Resolution ($d$)**\nWe need to find the resolution $d$ such that at least 30% of particles are observed. This means the fraction of particles traveling a distance greater than $d$ must be at least 0.30.\n$P(\\text{distance} > d) = e^{-d/L} \\ge 0.30$\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed,\" which in this context means the largest possible (i.e., coarsest) resolution that still satisfies the condition. We solve for the boundary case:\n$e^{-d/L} = 0.30$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{d}{L} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n$d = 1.204 \\times L \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.8838 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **3. Compare with Options and Refine Interpretation**\n\nOur calculated value is $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This is the threshold; any resolution smaller than this will work. Let's check the options:\nA) 2.08*1e-3 m  (Too large)\nB) 2.08*1e-6 m  (This is smaller than our threshold, so it works)\nC) 2.08*1e-1 m  (Too large)\nD) 2.08*1e-9 m  (This is also smaller, so it also works)\n\nBetween B and D, option B is much closer to the calculated threshold. In physics problems, when asked for a \"minimum required\" value, the answer is typically the one closest to the calculated boundary.\n\nHowever, there is a common feature in such problems, as noted by several agents. The percentage \"30%\" is often an approximation for a simpler fraction like $1/3$, which leads to a cleaner mathematical result. Let's test this hypothesis:\n$e^{-d/L} = 1/3$\n$-\\frac{d}{L} = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$\n$d = L \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.8838 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986)$\n$d \\approx 2.0695 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result, $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is extremely close to option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The difference is less than 0.5%, which is negligible and likely due to rounding of the given constants in the problem statement. This provides very strong evidence that this was the intended calculation.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe most consistent and precise method leads to a required resolution of approximately $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This value is an excellent match for option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe core of the problem is to find the minimum required detector resolution to observe the decay track of at least 30% of the $X^0$ particles. A decay is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution before it decays.\n\n### 2. Key Physical Principles\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle is moving at a very high energy (27 GeV) compared to its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. This means we must use relativistic formulas for energy, momentum, and time.\n*   **Time Dilation:** The particle's lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by a factor of $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor).\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The probability that a particle will travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying follows an exponential law: $P(x' \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n*   $E = 27$ GeV\n*   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. A precise formula for this is $\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$, which accounts for both time dilation and the particle's velocity.\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $\\gamma \\approx 7.918$\n\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot 7.854$\n$\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Required Resolution ($d$)**\nWe need to find the resolution $d$ such that the probability of the decay length being greater than $d$ is at least 30%.\n$P(\\text{distance} > d) = e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the boundary condition (the largest possible resolution that works), we solve for the equality:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n$d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m})$\n$d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThis result means that to see at least 30% of the decays, the detector resolution must be better (i.e., smaller) than $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### 4. Analysis of Options and Conclusion\nLet's examine the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\nOur calculated threshold is $d \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n*   Options A and B are much larger than this threshold and are therefore incorrect.\n*   Option C is much smaller, and while technically sufficient, it is not the value closest to the calculated threshold.\n*   Option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is less than our calculated threshold of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, so it is a valid resolution. It is also the only option of the correct order of magnitude.\n\n**A Note on Problem Design:** As pointed out by several candidate answers, it is common in physics problems for percentages like \"30%\" to be approximations for simple fractions. If we assume the intended fraction was $1/3$ (which is ~33.3%), the calculation becomes:\n$d = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot 1.0986 \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\nThis value is extremely close to option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This strongly suggests that this was the intended calculation, with the minor difference arising from the precise values of constants used.\n\nBoth lines of reasoning point to the same answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics Principles\nThe problem involves a high-energy particle, which means we must use the principles of special relativity.\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The particle's total energy ($E$) is related to its rest mass ($m_0$) by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) via the equation $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.\n*   **Time Dilation:** The particle's lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by a factor of $\\gamma$. So, $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. It is given by its velocity multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime. A precise formula is $\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The probability (or fraction of particles) that a particle travels a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n*   **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track must be longer than the detector's resolution, let's call it $d$. The problem requires that at least 30% of the decays are observed, which means we must find the resolution $d$ that satisfies the condition $P(x > d) \\ge 0.30$.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nGiven:\n*   Total energy $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest mass energy $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of total energy to rest energy:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nGiven:\n*   Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\nUsing the precise formula for the mean decay length:\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (7.854)$\n$\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution ($d$)**\nThe condition is that the fraction of observed decays must be at least 30%:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed\". In this context, this refers to the largest possible (i.e., coarsest) resolution that still satisfies the condition. We solve for the boundary case:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n$-d/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n$d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 4: Compare with Options and Refine Interpretation**\nThe calculated resolution is $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The closest option is $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The discrepancy suggests a common feature in physics problems: the percentage \"30%\" is likely an approximation for a simple fraction, in this case, $1/3$ (which is approximately 33.3%). Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIf we require observing at least $1/3$ of the decays:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n$-d/\\lambda = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3) \\approx -1.0986$\n$d = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986)$\n$d \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThis result, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an excellent match for the option $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The minor difference (less than 0.5%) is negligible and can be attributed to the precision of the constants used.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculation, refined by the highly probable assumption that \"at least 30%\" was intended to be \"at least 1/3\", yields a result of approximately $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.

To solve it, we need to apply principles from special relativity and particle physics.\n\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle's energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass (3.41 GeV), meaning it travels at a speed very close to the speed of light. This requires us to account for relativistic time dilation.\n*   **Time Dilation:** From the laboratory's perspective (the Bubble Chamber), the particle's internal clock runs slower. Its lifetime appears longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). This dilated lifetime ($\\tau$) is given by $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying is called the mean decay length. It is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its dilated lifetime ($\\tau$).\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of particles is a random process.

Deconstruction of the Physics Problem\nThe core of the problem is to find a detector resolution, which is a distance, based on the decay properties of a relativistic particle.\n\n*   **Given Data:**\n    *   Particle: $X^0$\n    *   Proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$): $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Total energy in lab frame (E): 27 GeV\n    *   Rest mass of $X^0$ ($m_0c^2$): 3.41 GeV\n*   **Condition:** The detector must be able to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Observing a Decay\":** For a decay to be observed, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution ($d_{res}$).\n*   **Goal:** Find the minimum required resolution, $d_{res}$.\n\n### 2. Required Calculations\nThe solution involves a sequence of calculations based on special relativity and particle decay statistics.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor quantifies the relativistic effects. It's the ratio of the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length in the Lab Frame ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. It accounts for both time dilation and the particle's velocity. A precise formula is:\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\nPlugging in the values:\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{62.69 - 1} \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot 7.854$\n$\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\nThis calculation is performed consistently across nearly all agents.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Observation Condition**\nThe fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than the resolution $d_{res}$ is given by the exponential decay law: $P(\\text{distance} > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$.\nThe condition is that this fraction must be at least 30%:\n$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n### 3. Analysis of the \"Minimum Resolution\" and \"30%\"\nThis is the key point where the agents' interpretations diverge slightly, but all lead to the same conclusion.\n\n*   **Interpretation A (Strict 30%):** We find the maximum possible resolution that satisfies the condition by solving the equality:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot 1.204 \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n    This value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is the coarsest the resolution can be. Any resolution *better* (i.e., smaller) than this is acceptable. Of the options, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is the only one that is both close to this value and satisfies the condition ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$).\n\n*   **Interpretation B (1/3 Hypothesis):** In physics problems with multiple-choice answers, round percentages like \"30%\" are often approximations for simple fractions. Testing the hypothesis that the intended fraction is $1/3$ (which is ~33.3%) is a standard problem-solving technique.\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n    $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n    This calculated value is an almost perfect match for the option $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This provides very strong evidence that this was the intended solution path.\n\n### 4. Synthesis of Agent Answers\nDespite some confusion in the lettering of the options within their individual responses, every single agent correctly identified the physics, performed the calculation, and concluded that the correct numerical answer is **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. The agents who used Interpretation B arrived at this answer most directly. The agents who used Interpretation A also correctly identified it as the only plausible choice.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe calculation, especially under the well-justified \"1/3 hypothesis\", points directly to the value $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This value corresponds to option A in the question's provided list.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physics and the Goal\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a relativistic particle.\n*   **Observation Condition:** A decay is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance, $x$, greater than the detector's resolution, $d$.\n*   **Decay Law:** The fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than $d$ before decaying is given by the exponential decay law: $P(x > d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the resolution $d$ that satisfies the condition $e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$. This sets an upper limit on the resolution: $d \\le -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$. The question asks for the required resolution, and we must find which of the given options is the intended answer.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\nFirst, we must calculate the mean decay length of the particle in the bubble chamber (the lab frame).\n\n*   **Given Values:**\n    *   Total Energy ($E$) = 27 GeV\n    *   Rest Mass Energy ($m_0c^2$) = 3.41 GeV\n    *   Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$) = $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Speed of Light ($c$) $\\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n    The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy to the rest mass energy.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Relativistic Momentum ($pc$)**\n    We use the energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n    The most precise formula for the mean decay length is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Required Resolution ($d$)\nNow we apply the observation condition.\n\n*   **Using the 30% Condition Literally:**\n    We solve for the boundary case: $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$.\n    $d = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n    This value is the maximum permissible resolution. The closest option is D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), which is a valid resolution since it is less than the calculated maximum.\n\n*   **Using the \"1/3 Hypothesis\":**\n    In physics problems, percentages like 30% are often approximations for simple fractions. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended condition was to observe at least $1/3$ of the decays.\n    We solve for the boundary case: $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    $d = -\\lambda \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\ln(3)$\n    $d \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (1.0986) \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 4. Final Decision\nThe calculation using the \"1/3 hypothesis\" yields a result of $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This value is an extremely close match to option D.\n\n*   **Calculated Value:** $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n*   **Option D:** $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThe difference is less than 0.5%, which is negligible and can be attributed to the rounding of the initial constants in the problem statement. The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis task requires a multi-step calculation based on the principles of special relativity and particle decay. I will first outline the plan and then execute it with Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The particle is moving at relativistic speeds. The Lorentz factor relates its total energy (E) in the lab frame to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$). The formula is $\\gamma = E / (m_0c^2)$.\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: In the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is dilated by the factor $\\gamma$. The average distance it travels before decaying, known as the mean decay length ($\\lambda$), can be calculated. A precise formula is $\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime.\n3.  **Apply the Decay Condition**: The problem asks for the minimum resolution, $d$, needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. A decay is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the resolution $d$. The fraction of particles that travel at least a distance $d$ is given by the exponential decay law: $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$.\n4.  **Solve for the Resolution ($d$)**: We need to solve the inequality $e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$. The boundary condition gives the largest possible resolution that satisfies the requirement: $d = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.3)$.\n5.  **Refine the Calculation**: In physics problems, a percentage like \"30%\" is often an approximation for a simple fraction.

This is due to time dilation.\n*   **Decay Length**: The increased lifetime in the lab frame means the particle travels, on average, a longer distance before decaying. This average distance is the mean decay length.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law**: The decay of particles is a random process. The fraction of particles that travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by an exponential function `P(x) = exp(-L_d / L_m)`, where `L_d` is the distance traveled and `L_m` is the mean decay length.\n*   **Detector Resolution**: To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must leave a track longer than the detector's resolution. Therefore, the resolution `d` must be such that the probability of the particle traveling a distance greater than `d` is at least 30%.\n\n### 2.

Understand the Goal and Physical Principles**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle, $X^0$. This involves several key concepts from relativistic physics:\n\n*   **Relativistic Motion:** The particle's energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so it is moving at a speed very close to the speed of light. We must use special relativity.\n*   **Time Dilation:** Due to its high speed, the particle's lifetime as measured in the laboratory frame (the Bubble Chamber) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). This dilated lifetime is given by $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Mean Decay Length:** The average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying is called the mean decay length, denoted by $L$ or $\\lambda$.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of particles is a random process. The fraction of particles that travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by the formula $P(x) = e^{-x/L}$.\n*   **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must leave a track longer than the detector's resolution, let's call it $d$. Therefore, we need to find the resolution $d$ such that the probability of the track length being greater than $d$ is at least 30%.\n\n### **2.

Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nGiven:\n*   Total energy $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest mass energy $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of total energy to rest energy:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nGiven:\n*   Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\nUsing the precise formula for the mean decay length:\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (7.854)$\n$\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution ($d$)**\nThe condition is that the fraction of observed decays must be at least 30%:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed\". In this context, this refers to the largest possible (i.e., coarsest) resolution that still satisfies the condition. We solve for the boundary case:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n$-d/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n$d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 4: Compare with Options and Refine Interpretation**\nThe calculated resolution is $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The closest option is $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The discrepancy suggests a common feature in physics problems: the percentage \"30%\" is likely an approximation for a simple fraction, in this case, $1/3$ (which is approximately 33.3%). Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIf we require observing at least $1/3$ of the decays:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n$-d/\\lambda = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3) \\approx -1.0986$\n$d = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986)$\n$d \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThis result, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an excellent match for the option $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The minor difference (less than 0.5%) is negligible and can be attributed to the precision of the constants used.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculation, refined by the highly probable assumption that \"at least 30%\" was intended to be \"at least 1/3\", yields a result of approximately $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This value corresponds directly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem involves a high-energy particle decaying in a detector. To solve it, we need to apply principles from special relativity and particle physics.\n\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle's energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass (3.41 GeV), meaning it travels at a speed very close to the speed of light. This requires us to account for relativistic time dilation.\n*   **Time Dilation:** From the laboratory's perspective (the Bubble Chamber), the particle's internal clock runs slower. Its lifetime appears longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). This dilated lifetime ($\\tau$) is given by $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying is called the mean decay length. It is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its dilated lifetime ($\\tau$).\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of particles is a random process. The fraction of particles that travel a distance of at least $d$ before decaying is given by the formula $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$.\n*   **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track length must be greater than the detector's resolution. The problem requires that at least 30% of the decays are observed, which translates to the condition: $e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy.\n*   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length can be calculated using the formula $\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$, which accurately accounts for the particle's velocity and dilated lifetime.\n*   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of Light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times 7.854 \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Required Resolution ($d$)**\nWe need to find the resolution $d$ that satisfies the condition $e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$. This inequality means that the resolution $d$ must be less than or equal to a certain maximum value. We find this maximum value by solving the equality:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n$d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result, $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is the coarsest (largest) resolution that can still observe at least 30% of the decays. Any detector with a resolution smaller than this value will also satisfy the condition.\n\n### **3. Compare with Options and Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated maximum allowable resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. We must choose an option that is less than or equal to this value.\nThe given options are:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\nComparing the options:\n*   Options A and B are much larger than our calculated threshold and are incorrect.\n*   Option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m) is a valid resolution, as it is much smaller than the threshold.\n*   Option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is also a valid resolution, as $2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\nIn multiple-choice physics problems, there is often a single best answer. The value from option D is very close to our calculated threshold. The small discrepancy is very likely due to the problem statement using \"30%\" as an approximation for a simpler fraction, such as 1/3.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis: if we need to observe at least 1/3 of the decays:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n$d = \\lambda \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis calculated value of $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is extremely close to option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This confirms that option D is the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",
