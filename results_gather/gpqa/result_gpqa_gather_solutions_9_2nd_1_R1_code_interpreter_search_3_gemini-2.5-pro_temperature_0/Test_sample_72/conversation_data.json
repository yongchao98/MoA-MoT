Analysis of the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem involves objects moving at relativistic speeds (significant fractions of the speed of light, c). Therefore, the principles of special relativity must be used, not classical mechanics.\n\n*   **Relative Speed:** The classical method of simply subtracting velocities ($v_1 - v_2$) is incorrect. The correct formula is the relativistic velocity transformation (also known as the velocity subtraction formula for co-linear motion).\n*   **Total Energy:** The classical kinetic energy formula ($1/2 mv^2$) is incorrect. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor and $m$ is the rest mass. The total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the individual, non-interacting astronauts.\n\n### **2.

Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed: **$v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$**\n*   Total energy: **$E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$**\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   **A) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2**\n*   B) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n*   C) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n*   D) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe calculated values exactly match option A.

The formula for two objects moving in the same direction is:\n    `v_rel = (v_1 - v_2) / (1 - (v_1 * v_2) / c^2)`\n    I will substitute `v_1 = 0.6c` and `v_2 = 0.5c` to find the value of `v_rel`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E_total):** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of the two astronauts (`E_total = E_1 + E_2`). The formula for the total energy of a single particle is:\n    `E = γ * m_rest * c^2`\n    where the Lorentz factor `γ` is `1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n    - I will first calculate the energy `E_1` for the astronaut with mass `2m` and velocity `0.6c`.\n    - Then, I will calculate the energy `E_2` for the astronaut with mass `3m` and velocity `0.5c`.\n    - Finally, I will sum `E_1` and `E_2` to get the total energy of the system.\n\n3.  **Compare and Conclude:** I will compare my calculated values for `v_rel` and `E_total` with the given options (A, B, C, D) to determine the correct answer.

Analysis of the Goal**\nThe question requires the calculation of two physical quantities for a system of two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds:\n*   The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between the two astronauts.\n*   The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the two-astronaut system.\n\n### **2. Given Information**\n*   Astronaut 1: Rest mass $m_1 = 2m$, velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$.\n*   Astronaut 2: Rest mass $m_2 = 3m$, velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   Both astronauts are traveling in the same direction.\n*   $c$ represents the speed of light.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n#### **Part A: Calculating the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, we cannot use the simple Galilean subtraction of velocities ($0.6c - 0.5c$). We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for relative velocity.\n*   **Formula:** The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Substitute the given velocities:\n        $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n    2.  Simplify the expression:\n        $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n    3.  Calculate the final value:\n        $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n    4.  Rounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n#### **Part B: Calculating the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The total energy of a relativistic particle is the sum of its rest energy and its kinetic energy. The formula for the total energy of a single particle is $E = \\gamma m_{rest} c^2$. The total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the individual astronauts.\n*   **Formula:**\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n    *   Total energy of the system: $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = (\\gamma_1 m_1 c^2) + (\\gamma_2 m_2 c^2)$\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n    1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor for astronaut 1 ($\\gamma_1$):\n        $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    2.  Calculate the total energy of astronaut 1 ($E_1$):\n        $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25) \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n    1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor for astronaut 2 ($\\gamma_2$):\n        $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    2.  Calculate the total energy of astronaut 2 ($E_2$):\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}) \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Total System Energy:**\n    1.  Sum the individual energies:\n        $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n    2.  $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2 \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n    3.  Rounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the calculated total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**. These results match option C.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while the numerical calculations are overwhelmingly correct, there are numerous errors in matching the correct calculation to the letter of the corresponding option. Based on a correct, independent calculation, the answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Careful Points and Strategy**\n\n*   **Relative Speed:** The astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds (a significant fraction of the speed of light, c). Therefore, the relative speed cannot be found by simple subtraction of their velocities. The correct method is to use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula.\n*   **Total Energy:** The total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speed is the sum of its rest energy and its kinetic energy. The formula for this total energy is `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor. The total energy of the system is the simple arithmetic sum of the total energies of the two individual astronauts.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity of two objects moving along the same line is:\n`v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁v₂) / c²)`\n\nGiven:\n*   `v₁ = 0.6c`\n*   `v₂ = 0.5c`\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c²/c²)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### **3. Calculation of Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is `E_total = E₁ + E₂`.\nThe energy for each astronaut is `E = γmc²`, where the Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n**For Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass `m₁ = 2m`\n*   Velocity `v₁ = 0.6c`\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ₁`:\n    `γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Calculate the energy `E₁`:\n    `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**For Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass `m₂ = 3m`\n*   Velocity `v₂ = 0.5c`\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) = 1 / (√3 / 2) = 2 / √3 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Calculate the energy `E₂`:\n    `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² = (2/√3) * (3m) * c² = 2√3 mc² ≈ 3.464 mc²`\n\n**Total System Energy:**\n*   `E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 2√3 mc²`\n*   `E_total = (2.5 + 2√3) mc² ≈ (2.5 + 3.464) mc² ≈ 5.964 mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   Total energy `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`\n\nThese results match option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while all performed the calculations correctly, several misidentified the final letter choice.
