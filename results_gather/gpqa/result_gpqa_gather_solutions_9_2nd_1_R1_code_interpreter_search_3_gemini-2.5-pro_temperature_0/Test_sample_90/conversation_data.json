This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide.\n3.  **Product 1 Structure:** The product is a β-hydroxy ketone: **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The reaction of a pre-formed lithium enolate with an aldehyde at low temperature is highly diastereoselective. According to the Zimmerman-Traxler model, the reaction proceeds through a chair-like transition state where the bulky phenyl group of benzaldehyde occupies an equatorial position to minimize steric hindrance. This leads to the preferential formation of the ***anti*** **diastereomer**. The *anti* product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will follow one of these, the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer, through the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reactivity of DAST:** The use of \"excess\" DAST is key. It indicates that both susceptible functional groups will react.\n    *   DAST converts ketones (C=O) to geminal difluorides (-CF₂).\n    *   DAST converts secondary alcohols (-OH) to alkyl fluorides (-F). This reaction typically proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Structural Transformation:**\n    *   The ketone at C1 of Product 1 is converted to a 1,1-difluoro group.\n    *   The secondary alcohol on the side chain is converted to a fluoride.\n    *   The final product's constitution is **2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Stereochemistry of Product 2**\n\nWe trace the stereochemistry from the major *anti*-aldol product, the (2R, αS) enantiomer:\n*   The fluorination of the ketone at C1 does not affect the stereocenter at C2. The C2 configuration remains **(R)**.\n*   The fluorination of the secondary alcohol at the α-carbon proceeds with inversion. The initial **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n*   Therefore, the resulting product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The overall reaction produces a racemic mixture of the (2R, αR) and (2S, αS) enantiomers.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe must find the option that matches the **(R, R)** stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n*   **A) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** Incorrect. This is a ketone, but the ketone group would have reacted with excess DAST.\n*   **B) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a molecule with an **(R)** configuration at the benzylic carbon (`(R)-...fluoromethyl`) and an **(R)** configuration at the ring carbon to which it is attached (`(R)-...cyclohexyl`). This corresponds to the **(R, R)** stereoisomer we predicted as the major product. (Note: There is a common typo in such problems where the product `2-(side chain)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane` is named as a `...-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl` derivative. We focus on the stereochemistry, which is the key differentiator).\n*   **C) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect. This is a fluoro-alcohol, not the geminal difluoride expected from the reaction of a ketone with excess DAST.\n*   **D) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the **(R, S)** stereoisomer. This would be the minor product, arising from the less-favored *syn*-aldol addition.\n\nSince the question asks for the structure of the product, we choose the major product formed. The major product has (R, R) stereochemistry, which is described by option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde and an acidic workup. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:** LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form a lithium enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is 2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone reacting with benzaldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will follow one of these, the (2R, αS) enantiomer, through the next step.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Function of \"Excess\" DAST:** The use of excess DAST is a critical detail. It ensures that both susceptible functional groups—the ketone and the alcohol—will undergo fluorination.\n    *   The ketone (C=O) is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol (-OH) is converted to a fluoride (-F).\n3.  **Elimination of Options:** This information allows us to immediately eliminate options that do not show the complete reaction.\n    *   Option A, `(S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one`, is incorrect because the ketone group has not reacted.\n    *   Option B, `(2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol`, is incorrect because the ketone is converted to a geminal difluoride, not a fluoro-alcohol.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Fluorination:** The fluorination of a secondary alcohol with DAST proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Final Stereochemistry\n\nWe will trace the stereochemistry starting from the major *anti*-aldol product, the (2R, αS)-enantiomer.\n\n*   The reaction at the C1 ketone (C=O → CF₂) does not affect the stereocenter at C2. Therefore, the C2 center remains **(R)**.\n*   The reaction at the benzylic alcohol (α-carbon) proceeds with inversion. The initial **(S)** configuration inverts to an **(R)** configuration.\n\nThe resulting product is the (2R, αR)-stereoisomer. The other enantiomer from the starting material, (2S, αR), would yield the (2S, αS)-product. Therefore, the final product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αR) and (2S, αS) isomers. The key feature is that the relative stereochemistry is (R*, R*).\n\n### Step 4: Matching with the Remaining Options\n\nWe are left with options C and D. There is a likely numbering error in the IUPAC names provided (the product should be a 1,1-difluoro derivative, not 2,2-difluoro). We must rely on the stereochemical descriptors (R/S) to make the final decision.\n\n*   **Option C: ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the isomer where the ring stereocenter is (R) and the benzylic stereocenter is (R). This corresponds to the **(R, R)** product we derived.\n*   **Option D: ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the isomer where the ring stereocenter is (R) and the benzylic stereocenter is (S). This corresponds to an **(R, S)** product, which would be formed from the minor *syn*-aldol adduct.\n\nSince the reaction sequence produces the (R, R) isomer as the major product, Option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reagents:** Cyclohexanone is treated with LDA (a strong, bulky base) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde, and then acidified.\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a directed aldol addition. LDA deprotonates cyclohexanone to form the kinetic lithium enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. The final acidic workup protonates the intermediate to give a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is 2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters (at C2 of the ring and at the alcohol carbon, Cα). The reaction of the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with benzaldehyde is known to be *anti*-selective. This means the major product is the *anti*-diastereomer, which exists as a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will follow one of these, the (2R, αS) isomer, through the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an *excess* of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reactions:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of excess reagent ensures that both the ketone and the alcohol functional groups will react.\n    *   The ketone (C=O) at C1 is converted to a geminal difluoride (CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol (-OH) at Cα is converted to a fluoride (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n3.  **Structure of Product 2:** The final product's structure is 2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Final Stereochemistry**\n\n1.  We start with the major aldol product, the (2R, αS) enantiomer.\n2.  The reaction at the C1 ketone does not affect the stereocenter at C2, so it remains **(R)**.\n3.  The reaction at the Cα alcohol proceeds with inversion. The initial **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n4.  Therefore, the major final product is the **(2R, αR)** stereoisomer (and its enantiomer, (2S, αS)). The relative stereochemistry is (R*, R*).\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe must find the option that matches the (R, R) stereochemistry.\n\n*   **A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This option describes a product with the correct functional groups (geminal difluoride and a single fluoride). The stereochemistry is specified as (R) for the ring carbon and (R) for the side-chain carbon. This matches our derived (R, R) stereochemistry. (Note: There is a likely numbering error in the name, which should be 1,1-difluoro, but the stereochemistry is the key differentiator).\n*   **B) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. The ketone is converted to a geminal difluoride (CF₂), not a fluoroalcohol (-CF(OH)-), by excess DAST.\n*   **C) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. The ketone group would have been fluorinated by the excess DAST.\n*   **D) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This option has (R, S) stereochemistry, which is incorrect for the major product.\n\nBased on the analysis, the major product has (R, R) stereochemistry, which corresponds to option A.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction\n    and determines the correct final product from the given options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Aldol Addition\n    step1_analysis = \"The first step is an anti-selective aldol addition between the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde.

The reaction is then quenched with acid (acidified).\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n    *   LDA is a strong, bulky base that deprotonates the α-carbon of cyclohexanone to form a lithium enolate. The low temperature favors the formation of the kinetic enolate.\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the reaction of a lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with an aldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. This is due to the steric constraints of the chair-like transition state. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers (where α denotes the benzylic carbon bearing the hydroxyl group). We will follow one of these enantiomers, for example, the **(2R, αS)** isomer, through the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)**\n\n1.  **Reactant and Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an \"excess\" of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Function of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of an excess of the reagent is a critical detail, indicating that it will react with all susceptible functional groups.\n    *   DAST converts ketones (C=O) to geminal difluorides (-CF₂).\n    *   DAST converts secondary alcohols (-OH) to alkyl fluorides (-F). This reaction typically proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Transformation of Product 1:**\n    *   The ketone group at C1 of the cyclohexanone ring is converted to a 1,1-difluoro group (-CF₂). This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   The secondary alcohol group on the side chain is converted to a fluoride. The stereocenter at this position is inverted.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** We trace the stereochemistry from the major *anti*-aldol product.\n    *   Starting with the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer of Product 1.\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at the α-carbon undergoes inversion: the **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n    *   The resulting product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration.\n    *   Similarly, the other enantiomer of the starting material, (2S, αR), would yield the (2S, αS) product.\n    *   Therefore, the major final product is the racemic mixture of the (2R, αR) and (2S, αS) isomers.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe must find the option that matches the structure and stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n*   **A) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect. This is a fluoro-alcohol. Excess DAST converts the ketone to a geminal difluoride.\n*   **B) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** Incorrect. This is a ketone. Excess DAST would have reacted with the ketone group.\n*   **C) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, S) stereoisomer.

This matches one of the enantiomers of the major product we predicted from the *anti*-aldol pathway.\n\n**Note on Nomenclature:** There is a likely typographical error in the IUPAC names provided in options C and D. The reaction produces a `1,1-difluoro` group, but the options list `2,2-difluoro`. Assuming this is an error in the question and that the stereochemical descriptors are the intended point of differentiation, we choose the option that matches the stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reaction sequence favors the formation of the *anti*-aldol product, which upon reaction with excess DAST, yields the (R,R) and (S,S) diastereomers as the major final products.

This reaction typically proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter (Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n3.  **Transformation of Product 1:**\n    *   The ketone at C1 of the cyclohexanone ring is converted to a 1,1-difluoro group. This does not affect the stereocenter at C2.\n    *   The secondary alcohol on the side chain is converted to a fluoride.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 2:**\n    *   We start with the (2R, αS) enantiomer of Product 1.\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 of the ring is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at the benzylic alcohol (α-carbon) has an (S) configuration. The reaction with DAST causes inversion, so the configuration becomes **(R)**.\n    *   Therefore, the resulting product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The other enantiomer of Product 1, (2S, αR), would yield the (2S, αS) product. The final product is a racemic mixture of the (R,R) and (S,S) isomers.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Options\n\nWe need to find the option that matches the structure and stereochemistry of the major product, which has a relative stereochemistry of (R*, R*).\n\n*   **A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a molecule with an (R) configuration at the benzylic carbon (the `fluoromethyl` part) and an (R) configuration at the ring carbon to which it is attached. This corresponds to the **(R,R)** isomer we derived as the major product. (Note: There is a common error in the IUPAC numbering in such problems; the product is a 1,1-difluoro derivative, but the stereochemistry is the key determinant).\n*   **B) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This describes the (R,S) isomer. This would be a minor product, as it would derive from the minor *syn*-aldol adduct.\n*   **C) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is an incorrect structure.

Option A correctly describes one of these enantiomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at a low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde and an acidic workup. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The reaction of a pre-formed lithium enolate with an aldehyde at low temperature is highly diastereoselective. According to the Zimmerman-Traxler model, which involves a six-membered chair-like transition state, the reaction preferentially forms the ***anti***-diastereomer. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Function of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups react.\n    *   It converts the ketone (C=O) at C1 into a geminal difluoride (-CF₂).\n    *   It converts the secondary alcohol (-OH) into a fluoride (-F). This reaction typically proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Stereochemistry of Product 2\n\nTo find the major final product, we trace the stereochemistry starting from one of the enantiomers of the major *anti*-aldol product.\n\n1.  Let's start with the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer of Product 1.\n2.  The fluorination of the ketone at C1 does not affect the stereocenter at C2, so its configuration remains **(R)**.\n3.  The fluorination of the secondary alcohol at the α-carbon proceeds with inversion of configuration. Therefore, the **(S)** stereocenter becomes **(R)**.\n4.  The resulting product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The other enantiomer of the starting material, (2S, αR), would yield the (2S, αS) product.\n\nThus, the major final product (Product 2) is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αR) and (2S, αS) stereoisomers of 1,1-difluoro-2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexane.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must find the option that matches the **(R, R)** stereochemistry.\n\n*   **A) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** Incorrect. This is not the final product, as the ketone group has not reacted.\n*   **B) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect. This is a fluoro-alcohol, not the geminal difluoride expected from the reaction of a ketone with excess DAST.\n*   **C) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, S) diastereomer. This would be a minor product, as it would arise from the less-favored *syn*-aldol adduct.\n*   **D) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, R) stereoisomer. This matches one of the enantiomers of the major product derived from the favored *anti*-aldol addition followed by inversion.\n\nAlthough there is a likely numbering error in the IUPAC names provided in options C and D (it should be 1,1-difluoro, not 2,2-difluoro), the stereochemical descriptors are the key to solving the problem. The stereochemistry of the major product is (R, R), which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reagents:** The reaction begins with cyclohexanone, which is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at a low temperature, followed by the addition of benzaldehyde. The reaction mixture is then acidified.\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   The final acidification step protonates the intermediate alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the reaction between the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone and an aldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. This is due to the bulky phenyl group of benzaldehyde preferentially occupying an equatorial position in the chair-like transition state to minimize steric hindrance. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will follow one of these enantiomers, **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**, through the next step.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination)\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reactions:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of an \"excess\" of the reagent ensures that both the ketone and the alcohol functional groups will react.\n    *   **Ketone Fluorination:** The ketone group (C=O) at position C1 of the cyclohexanone ring is converted into a geminal difluoride (-CF₂). This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   **Alcohol Fluorination:** The secondary alcohol group (-OH) is converted into a fluoride (-F). This reaction (deoxyfluorination) proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n\n### Determining the Stereochemistry of Product 2\n\n1.  **Starting Isomer (from Step 1):** We start with the major *anti*-aldol product, specifically the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer.\n2.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 of the cyclohexane ring is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at the benzylic alcohol (the α-carbon) undergoes inversion. The initial **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n3.  **Final Product:** The major product formed is the **(2R, αR)** stereoisomer. The overall reaction produces a racemic mixture of this (2R, αR) product and its (2S, αS) enantiomer.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must find the option that matches the **(R, R)** stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n*   **A) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect because the ketone functional group would have been converted to a difluoride by the excess DAST.\n*   **B) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, S) stereoisomer. This is not the major product derived from the *anti*-aldol addition followed by inversion.\n*   **C) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. Excess DAST converts the ketone to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂), not a fluoroalcohol (-CF(OH)-).\n*   **D) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, R) stereoisomer. This matches the stereochemistry of the major product derived from our step-by-step analysis. (Note: There is a likely numbering error in the IUPAC name provided in the options; the product is a 1,1-difluoro derivative, not 2,2. However, the stereochemical descriptors are the key differentiator).\n\nBased on the analysis, the major product has (R,R) relative stereochemistry, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at a low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde and an acidic workup. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. The reaction of the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with benzaldehyde is known to favor the formation of the ***anti***-diastereomer as the major product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers (where α denotes the benzylic carbon bearing the hydroxyl group).\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Function of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups—the ketone and the alcohol—will react.\n    *   The ketone (C=O) at C1 is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol (-OH) at the α-position is converted to a fluoride (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Stereochemistry of Product 2\n\nTo find the final structure, we trace the stereochemical changes starting from one of the enantiomers of the major *anti*-aldol product, for example, the **(2R, αS)** isomer.\n\n*   The conversion of the ketone at C1 to a -CF₂ group does not affect the stereocenter at C2. Therefore, the C2 configuration remains **(R)**.\n*   The fluorination of the alcohol at the α-carbon occurs with inversion of configuration. Thus, the initial **(S)** configuration inverts to an **(R)** configuration.\n\nThe resulting product is the **(2R, αR)** stereoisomer. The other starting enantiomer, (2S, αR), would similarly yield the (2S, αS) product. Therefore, the major final product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αR) and (2S, αS) isomers.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must now match our predicted product with the given choices.\n\n*   **A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene**\n*   **B) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene**\n*   **C) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**\n*   **D) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol**\n\n1.  **Eliminate Incorrect Functional Groups:** Options C and D are incorrect because they represent incomplete reactions. Excess DAST would have converted both the ketone and the alcohol. Option C retains the ketone, and Option D is a fluoro-alcohol instead of a geminal difluoride.\n2.  **Analyze Stereochemistry:** Options A and B have the correct functional groups. They differ only in their stereochemistry. There is a common typo in the naming (`2,2-difluoro` instead of the correct `1,1-difluoro`), which we will overlook to focus on the critical stereochemical aspect.\n    *   **Option A** describes the **(2R, αR)** isomer. This matches one of the enantiomers of the major product we predicted.\n    *   **Option B** describes the **(2R, αS)** isomer. This diastereomer would not be the major product of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reaction favors the *anti*-aldol product, and the subsequent fluorination of the alcohol proceeds with inversion. This leads to a final product with (R,R) or (S,S) stereochemistry. Option A correctly describes the (R,R) enantiomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reagents:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde, and then acidified.\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a directed aldol addition. LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone to form the kinetic lithium enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. The final acidification step protonates the intermediate alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone, which is Product 1.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is 2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler transition state model. While the simple model for the Z-enolate of cyclohexanone predicts a *syn* product, this reaction is a well-known exception where steric hindrance in the transition state leads to the preferential formation of the ***anti*** **diastereomer** as the major product. The *anti* diastereomer has a relative stereochemistry of (2R*, αR*) or (2S*, αS*). We will follow one of these enantiomers, for example, the **(2R, αR)** isomer, as the major starting material for the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reactions:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups will react.\n    *   The ketone group (C=O) at C1 of the cyclohexanone ring is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol group (-OH) on the side chain is converted to a fluoride (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter (an Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** We trace the stereochemical changes from the major isomer of Product 1.\n    *   Starting material: **(2R, αR)**-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The fluorination of the ketone at C1 does not affect the stereocenter at C2, so it remains **(R)**.\n    *   The fluorination of the alcohol at the α-carbon proceeds with inversion. The configuration changes from **(R)** to **(S)**.\n    *   Therefore, the major enantiomer of Product 2 has the **(2R, αS)** configuration. The final product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) isomers.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe need to find the option that matches the structure and stereochemistry of the major product, which has a relative stereochemistry of (R, S) or (S, R).\n\n*   **A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This describes the (R, R) stereoisomer. This would be the minor product, derived from the *syn*-aldol adduct.\n*   **B) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. The ketone group would have been converted to a difluoride by the excess DAST.\n*   **C) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, S) stereoisomer (the cyclohexyl ring stereocenter is R, and the benzylic stereocenter is S). This matches the stereochemistry of the major product derived from our analysis.\n*   **D) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. The ketone is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂), not a fluoro-alcohol.\n\nThe correct structure is the one derived from the major *anti*-aldol product followed by inversion at the alcohol center, which results in the (R, S) relative stereochemistry. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde, and then acidified. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at an α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   Acidification protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone, which is **Product 1**. The structure is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the reaction between the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone and an aldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. This is due to the chair-like transition state arranging itself to minimize steric interactions, placing the bulky phenyl group in an equatorial-like position, which leads to the *anti* configuration. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. For the next step, we will follow one of these enantiomers, for example, **(2R)-2-((S)-hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Function of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups (the ketone and the alcohol) will react.\n    *   DAST converts ketones (C=O) to geminal difluorides (-CF₂).\n    *   DAST converts secondary alcohols (-OH) to alkyl fluorides (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Transformation of Product 1:**\n    *   The ketone at C1 of the cyclohexanone ring is converted to a 1,1-difluoro group (-CF₂). This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at C2.\n    *   The secondary alcohol on the side chain is converted to a fluoride, and its stereocenter is inverted.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 2:**\n    *   We start with the (2R, αS) enantiomer of Product 1.\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 of the ring remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at the benzylic alcohol, which was (S), inverts to **(R)**.\n    *   Therefore, the resulting product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The reaction produces a racemic mixture of this (R,R) product and its (S,S) enantiomer.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Options\n\nWe need to find the option that matches the **(R,R)** stereoisomer.\n\n*   **A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a molecule with an (R) configuration at the benzylic carbon (`(R)-...fluoromethyl`) and an (R) configuration at the ring carbon to which it is attached (`(R)-...cyclohexyl`). This corresponds to the **(R,R)** isomer we predicted. (Note: There is a common typo in such problems where the product `1,1-difluoro-2-substituted-cyclohexane` is named as a `2,2-difluoro` derivative. We focus on the stereochemistry, which is the key differentiator).\n*   **B) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. The ketone is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂), not a fluoroalcohol (-CF(OH)-).\n*   **C) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This describes the **(R,S)** isomer (R on the ring, S on the side chain). This would be the product if the fluorination occurred with retention of configuration, which is not the standard mechanism for DAST.\n*   **D) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. The ketone functional group would have been converted to a difluoride by the excess DAST.\n\nBased on the analysis, the major product has (R,R) stereochemistry, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction Type:** The first step involves treating cyclohexanone with Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by the addition of benzaldehyde, and finally an acidic workup. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates the α-carbon of cyclohexanone to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product of this aldol addition is a β-hydroxy ketone, specifically **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is governed by the Zimmerman-Traxler transition state model. For the reaction of the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with benzaldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers (where α refers to the benzylic carbon). For the purpose of tracking the stereochemistry, we will follow one of these enantiomers, the **(2R, αS)** isomer.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction Type:** Product 1 is treated with an *excess* of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST). DAST is a fluorinating agent.\n2.  **Reactivity of DAST:** The use of \"excess\" DAST is a critical detail, indicating that it will react with all susceptible functional groups in the molecule.\n    *   DAST converts ketones (C=O) to geminal difluorides (-CF₂).\n    *   DAST converts secondary alcohols (-OH) to alkyl fluorides (-F). This reaction, known as deoxofluorination, proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Transformation of Product 1:**\n    *   The ketone group at C1 of the cyclohexanone ring is converted to a 1,1-difluoro group. This transformation does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   The secondary alcohol on the side chain is converted to a fluoride.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Stereochemistry of Product 2\n\n1.  We start with the major aldol product, the **(2R, αS)**-enantiomer.\n2.  The stereocenter at C2 of the ring is unaffected by the reactions and remains **(R)**.\n3.  The stereocenter at the alcohol (the α-carbon) undergoes inversion of configuration during fluorination. Therefore, the initial **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n4.  The resulting major product is the **(2R, αR)** enantiomer. The overall reaction produces a racemic mixture of the (2R, αR) and (2S, αS) products. The key feature is that the relative stereochemistry of the two centers is (R,R) or (S,S).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must find the option that matches the structure and stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n*   **A) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect. This is a fluoroalcohol. Excess DAST converts the ketone to a geminal difluoride.\n*   **B) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (2R, αS) stereoisomer. This is not the major product.\n*   **C) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** Incorrect. This product still contains a ketone, which would have been fluorinated by excess DAST.\n*   **D) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (2R, αR) stereoisomer. This matches the stereochemistry of the major product derived from the *anti*-aldol addition followed by inversion at the alcohol center.\n\nNote: There is a likely typographical error in the IUPAC names provided in options B and D. The reaction produces a 1,1-difluoro group at the former carbonyl position (C1), so the product is a substituted 1,1-difluorocyclohexane. The options name it as a 2,2-difluorocyclohexyl derivative. Assuming this is a typo in the question, the stereochemical descriptors are the deciding factor.\n\nBased on the analysis, the major product has (R,R) stereochemistry, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of Product 2.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reagents:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde, and then acidified.\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at an α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   Acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters. The reaction of the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with an aldehyde is known to be diastereoselective, preferentially forming the ***anti***-diastereomer as the major product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will follow the (2R, αS) enantiomer through the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination and Rearrangement)**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Mechanism:** This step is more complex than a simple double fluorination. It involves three key transformations:\n    *   **a) Fluorodehydroxylation:** The secondary alcohol group is converted to a fluoride. This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** (Sₙ2-like).\n        *   Starting with the (2R, αS)-alcohol, this step yields an intermediate α-fluoroketone with (2R, αR) stereochemistry: (2R)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **b) DAST-induced Rearrangement:** α-fluoroketones are known to undergo rearrangement in the presence of DAST. The carbonyl at C1 is activated, followed by a 1,2-migration of the substituent from C2 to C1. The ketone functionality effectively moves from C1 to C2.\n        *   The `(R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl` group migrates from C2 to C1. The stereochemistry of the migrating group is retained.\n        *   This forms a new ketone intermediate: (1R)-1-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-2-one. The stereochemistry at C1 is established during the migration, and the stereocenter at C2 is lost as it becomes a carbonyl.\n    *   **c) Geminal Difluorination:** The excess DAST then reacts with the newly formed ketone at C2, converting the C=O group into a CF₂ group. This does not affect the existing stereocenters.\n3.  **Structure and Stereochemistry of Product 2:** The final product is **(1R)-1-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-2,2-difluorocyclohexane**. This product has an (R) configuration at the benzylic carbon and an (R) configuration at C1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Step 3: Matching the Product with the Options**\n\nThe options must be carefully analyzed. The IUPAC names provided are unconventional but describe the stereochemistry.\n\n*   **A) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a product with (R) stereochemistry on the ring and (S) stereochemistry on the side chain. This would be the minor product, derived from the *syn*-aldol adduct.\n*   **B) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is an intermediate, not the final product, as the ketone would have reacted with excess DAST.\n*   **C) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a product where the benzylic carbon (`fluoromethyl`) is (R) and the ring carbon it's attached to (`cyclohexyl`) is also (R). This corresponds to the (1R, αR) stereochemistry we derived for the major product from the rearrangement pathway. The `2,2-difluoro` locant in the name correctly matches the position of the difluoro group in the rearranged product.\n*   **D) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is a fluoroalcohol, not the geminal difluoride expected from the reaction of a ketone with excess DAST.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction proceeds through an *anti*-selective aldol addition, followed by a fluorination/rearrangement/fluorination sequence with DAST. This pathway leads to the (R, R) stereoisomer as the major product.

The reaction of a pre-formed lithium enolate of a cyclic ketone (like cyclohexanone) with an aldehyde at low temperature is known to be diastereoselective. According to the Zimmerman-Traxler model, this reaction preferentially forms the ***anti***-diastereomer as the major product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will track one of these enantiomers, for example, **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**, through the next step.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination)\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reagent's Function:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent is a critical detail, indicating that all susceptible functional groups will react.\n    *   DAST converts ketones (C=O) to geminal difluorides (-CF₂).\n    *   DAST converts alcohols (-OH) to alkyl fluorides (-F). This reaction typically proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Structural Transformation:**\n    *   The ketone at C1 of Product 1 is converted to a 1,1-difluoro group.\n    *   The secondary alcohol on the side chain is converted to a fluoride.\n    *   The final structure is **2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane**.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Final Stereochemistry\n\nWe will trace the stereochemical changes starting from the major *anti*-aldol product, the (2R, αS) enantiomer.\n\n*   The reaction at the C1 ketone does not affect the stereocenter at C2. Therefore, the **(R)** configuration at C2 is retained.\n*   The fluorination of the secondary alcohol at the benzylic position (α-carbon) proceeds with inversion of configuration. The initial **(S)** configuration inverts to an **(R)** configuration.\n\nThus, the major product formed is the **(2R, αR)** stereoisomer (and its enantiomer, the (2S, αS) isomer). The key is that the relative stereochemistry of the two centers is (R,R) or (S,S).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Options\n\nFirst, we eliminate options with incorrect functional groups. Excess DAST reacts with both the ketone and the alcohol.\n*   B) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one: Incorrect. The ketone group would have reacted.\n*   D) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. The ketone becomes a geminal difluoride, not a fluoroalcohol, and the alcohol would have reacted.\n\nThis leaves options A and C. Both describe the correct functional groups but have different stereochemistry. There is a likely numbering error in the IUPAC names provided (2,2-difluoro instead of the correct 1,1-difluoro), so we must rely on the stereochemical descriptors (R/S) to make the final decision.\n\n*   **A) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the isomer with **(R)** configuration at the ring stereocenter and **(S)** configuration at the side chain stereocenter. This is the (R, S) diastereomer.\n*   **C) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the isomer with **(R)** configuration at the ring stereocenter and **(R)** configuration at the side chain stereocenter. This is the (R, R) diastereomer.\n\nOur analysis concluded that the major product has the (R, R) relative stereochemistry. Therefore, option C correctly represents one of the enantiomers of the major product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reagents:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde, and then acidified.\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   Acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone, which is Product 1.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The reaction of a pre-formed lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with an aldehyde is known to be diastereoselective, preferentially forming the ***anti***-diastereomer as the major product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers (where α denotes the benzylic carbon bearing the hydroxyl group). For the subsequent analysis, we will follow one of these enantiomers, for example, **(2R, αS)**.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reactions:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups react.\n    *   **Ketone Fluorination:** The ketone group (C=O) at C1 is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂). This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   **Alcohol Fluorination:** The secondary alcohol (-OH) is converted to a fluoride (-F). This reaction (deoxyfluorination) proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** We trace the stereochemical changes starting from the (2R, αS) enantiomer of Product 1.\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 of the cyclohexane ring is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at the benzylic alcohol (α-carbon) undergoes inversion. The initial **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n4.  **Final Product:** The major product formed is the **(2R, αR)** stereoisomer (and its enantiomer, the (2S, αS) isomer). The structure is 2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must now match our derived product, the (R, R) isomer, with the given options.\n\n*   **A) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. It is a fluoroalcohol, but excess DAST converts the ketone to a geminal difluoride.\n*   **B) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, S) stereoisomer. This is a diastereomer of our product and is not the major product formed.\n*   **C) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, R) stereoisomer. This perfectly matches the stereochemistry of the major product derived from our analysis. (Note: The \"2,2-difluoro\" is a likely typo in the question and should be \"1,1-difluoro\", but the stereochemical descriptors are the key differentiator).\n*   **D) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. It is an α-fluoroketone, but the ketone would have also reacted with the excess DAST.\n\nBased on the well-established stereochemical outcomes of the aldol addition and DAST fluorination, the major product has (R, R) relative stereochemistry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Aldol Addition Reaction (Formation of Product 1)\n\n1.  **Reagents:** The reaction begins with cyclohexanone, which is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at a low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde. The mixture is then acidified.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA is a strong, bulky base that deprotonates the α-carbon of cyclohexanone to form a lithium enolate. This enolate is the nucleophile.\n    *   The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde in an aldol addition reaction.\n    *   The final acidification step protonates the intermediate alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The constitutional structure of Product 1 is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is governed by the Zimmerman-Traxler transition state model. For the reaction of a lithium enolate of a cyclic ketone like cyclohexanone with an aldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. The *anti*-product has a relative stereochemistry of (2R*, αS*). This means the product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers.\n\n### Step 2: Fluorination with DAST (Formation of Product 2)\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Mechanism:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both the ketone and alcohol functional groups react.\n    *   **Ketone Fluorination:** The ketone group (C=O) at position C1 is converted into a geminal difluoride (CF₂). This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   **Alcohol Fluorination:** The secondary alcohol group (-OH) is converted into a fluoride (-F). This reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the chiral center.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Stereochemistry of Product 2\n\nTo find the structure of the major final product, we trace the stereochemistry from the major *anti*-aldol product formed in Step 1.\n\n1.  Let's consider one enantiomer of the major *anti*-product: **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n2.  During the reaction with excess DAST:\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 of the cyclohexane ring is unaffected. It remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at the alcohol (the α-carbon), which has an (S) configuration, undergoes inversion. The (S) configuration becomes **(R)**.\n3.  Therefore, the resulting major product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The reaction produces a racemic mixture of this (2R, αR) product and its (2S, αS) enantiomer. The key is that the relative stereochemistry of the two centers is (R*, R*).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must now find the option that matches the **(R, R)** stereochemistry.\n\n*   **A) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. The product is not a fluoro-alcohol; the ketone is converted to a geminal difluoride by excess DAST.\n*   **B) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a molecule with an (R) configuration at the ring stereocenter and an (R) configuration at the benzylic stereocenter. This **(R, R)** configuration matches our analysis of the major reaction pathway. (Note: The name contains a common typo, \"2,2-difluoro\" instead of the correct \"1,1-difluoro\", but the stereochemical descriptors are the deciding factor).\n*   **C) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. The product does not contain a ketone group, as it would have reacted with the excess DAST.\n*   **D) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, S) stereoisomer. This would be the minor product, as it would arise from the minor *syn*-aldol adduct.\n\nThe question asks for the structure of product 2, which is conventionally the major product of the reaction sequence.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde and an acidic workup. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:** LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide.\n3.  **Product 1 Structure:** The product is a β-hydroxy ketone: **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters (at C2 of the ring and at the benzylic carbon, Cα). The reaction of a pre-formed lithium enolate of a cyclic ketone with an aldehyde at low temperature is highly diastereoselective. According to the Zimmerman-Traxler model, the reaction proceeds through a chair-like transition state that minimizes steric hindrance. This leads to the preferential formation of the ***anti*** **diastereomer**. The *anti* product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers.

The C2 configuration remains **(R)**.\n*   The fluorination of the secondary alcohol at the α-carbon proceeds with inversion. The initial **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n*   Therefore, the resulting major product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration.

This corresponds to the **(R, R)** stereoisomer we predicted as the major product.\n*   **C) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** Incorrect. This is a ketone, but the ketone group would have reacted with excess DAST.\n*   **D) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the **(R, S)** stereoisomer. This would be the minor product, arising from the less-favored *syn*-aldol addition.\n\n**Note on Nomenclature:** There is a likely typographical error in the IUPAC names provided in options B and D. The reaction produces a `1,1-difluoro` group, but the options list `2,2-difluoro`. This could also indicate a rearrangement mechanism. However, both the simple substitution and the rearrangement pathways lead to a final product with (R,R) stereochemistry.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct structure of product 2.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde, and then acidified. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA is a strong, bulky base that deprotonates cyclohexanone at an α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   Acidification protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The reaction of a pre-formed lithium enolate of a cyclic ketone (like cyclohexanone) with an aldehyde at low temperature is known to be diastereoselective. According to the Zimmerman-Traxler model, this reaction preferentially forms the ***anti***-diastereomer as the major product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will track one of these enantiomers, for example, **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**, through the next step.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination)\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with an *excess* of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reagent's Function:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent is a critical detail, indicating that all susceptible functional groups will react.\n    *   DAST converts ketones (C=O) to geminal difluorides (-CF₂).\n    *   DAST converts alcohols (-OH) to alkyl fluorides (-F). This reaction typically proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Structural Transformation:**\n    *   The ketone at C1 of Product 1 is converted to a 1,1-difluoro group.\n    *   The secondary alcohol on the side chain is converted to a fluoride.\n    *   The final structure is **2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane**.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Final Stereochemistry\n\nWe will trace the stereochemical changes starting from the major *anti*-aldol product, the (2R, αS) enantiomer.\n\n*   The reaction at the C1 ketone does not affect the stereocenter at C2. Therefore, the **(R)** configuration at C2 is retained.\n*   The fluorination of the secondary alcohol at the benzylic position (α-carbon) proceeds with inversion of configuration. The initial **(S)** configuration inverts to an **(R)** configuration.\n\nThus, the major product formed is the **(2R, αR)** stereoisomer (and its enantiomer, the (2S, αS) isomer). The key is that the relative stereochemistry of the two centers is (R,R) or (S,S).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Options\n\nFirst, we eliminate options with incorrect functional groups. Excess DAST reacts with both the ketone and the alcohol.\n*   A) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. The ketone becomes a geminal difluoride, not a fluoroalcohol.\n*   C) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one: Incorrect. The ketone group would have reacted.\n\nThis leaves options B and D. Both describe the correct functional groups but have different stereochemistry. There is a likely numbering error in the IUPAC names provided (2,2-difluoro instead of the correct 1,1-difluoro), so we must rely on the stereochemical descriptors (R/S) to make the final decision.\n\n*   **B) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the isomer with **(R)** configuration at the ring stereocenter and **(R)** configuration at the side chain stereocenter. This is the **(R, R)** diastereomer.\n*   **D) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the isomer with **(R)** configuration at the ring stereocenter and **(S)** configuration at the side chain stereocenter. This is the (R, S) diastereomer.\n\nOur analysis concluded that the major product has the (R, R) relative stereochemistry.

This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide.\n3.  **Product 1 Structure:** The product is a β-hydroxy ketone: **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The reaction of a pre-formed lithium enolate with an aldehyde at low temperature is highly diastereoselective. According to the Zimmerman-Traxler model, the reaction proceeds through a chair-like transition state where the bulky phenyl group of benzaldehyde occupies an equatorial position to minimize steric hindrance. This leads to the preferential formation of the ***anti*** **diastereomer**. The *anti* product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will follow one of these, the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer, through the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reactivity of DAST:** The use of \"excess\" DAST is key. It indicates that both susceptible functional groups will react.\n    *   DAST converts ketones (C=O) to geminal difluorides (-CF₂).\n    *   DAST converts secondary alcohols (-OH) to alkyl fluorides (-F). This reaction typically proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Structural Transformation:**\n    *   The ketone at C1 of Product 1 is converted to a 1,1-difluoro group.\n    *   The secondary alcohol on the side chain is converted to a fluoride.\n    *   The final product's constitution is **2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Stereochemistry of Product 2**\n\nWe trace the stereochemistry from the major *anti*-aldol product, the (2R, αS) enantiomer:\n*   The fluorination of the ketone at C1 does not affect the stereocenter at C2. The C2 configuration remains **(R)**.\n*   The fluorination of the secondary alcohol at the α-carbon proceeds with inversion. The initial **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n*   Therefore, the resulting product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The overall reaction produces a racemic mixture of the (2R, αR) and (2S, αS) enantiomers.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe must find the option that matches the **(R, R)** stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n*   **A) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** Incorrect. This is a ketone, but the ketone group would have reacted with excess DAST.\n*   **B) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a molecule with an **(R)** configuration at the benzylic carbon (`(R)-...fluoromethyl`) and an **(R)** configuration at the ring carbon to which it is attached (`(R)-...cyclohexyl`). This corresponds to the **(R, R)** stereoisomer we predicted as the major product. (Note: There is a common typo in such problems where the product `2-(side chain)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane` is named as a `...-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl` derivative. We focus on the stereochemistry, which is the key differentiator).\n*   **C) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect.

This would be the minor product, arising from the less-favored *syn*-aldol addition.\n\nSince the question asks for the structure of the product, we choose the major product formed. The major product has (R, R) stereochemistry, which is described by option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde and an acidic workup. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:** LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form a lithium enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is 2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone reacting with benzaldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will follow one of these, the (2R, αS) enantiomer, through the next step.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Function of \"Excess\" DAST:** The use of excess DAST is a critical detail. It ensures that both susceptible functional groups—the ketone and the alcohol—will undergo fluorination.\n    *   The ketone (C=O) is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol (-OH) is converted to a fluoride (-F).\n3.  **Elimination of Options:** This information allows us to immediately eliminate options that do not show the complete reaction.\n    *   Option A, `(S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one`, is incorrect because the ketone group has not reacted.\n    *   Option B, `(2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol`, is incorrect because the ketone is converted to a geminal difluoride, not a fluoro-alcohol.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Fluorination:** The fluorination of a secondary alcohol with DAST proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Final Stereochemistry\n\nWe will trace the stereochemistry starting from the major *anti*-aldol product, the (2R, αS)-enantiomer.\n\n*   The reaction at the C1 ketone (C=O → CF₂) does not affect the stereocenter at C2. Therefore, the C2 center remains **(R)**.\n*   The reaction at the benzylic alcohol (α-carbon) proceeds with inversion. The initial **(S)** configuration inverts to an **(R)** configuration.\n\nThe resulting product is the (2R, αR)-stereoisomer. The other enantiomer from the starting material, (2S, αR), would yield the (2S, αS)-product. Therefore, the final product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αR) and (2S, αS) isomers. The key feature is that the relative stereochemistry is (R*, R*).\n\n### Step 4: Matching with the Remaining Options\n\nWe are left with options C and D. There is a likely numbering error in the IUPAC names provided (the product should be a 1,1-difluoro derivative, not 2,2-difluoro). We must rely on the stereochemical descriptors (R/S) to make the final decision.\n\n*   **Option C: ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the isomer where the ring stereocenter is (R) and the benzylic stereocenter is (R). This corresponds to the **(R, R)** product we derived.\n*   **Option D: ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the isomer where the ring stereocenter is (R) and the benzylic stereocenter is (S). This corresponds to an **(R, S)** product, which would be formed from the minor *syn*-aldol adduct.\n\nSince the reaction sequence produces the (R, R) isomer as the major product, Option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reagents:** Cyclohexanone is treated with LDA (a strong, bulky base) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde, and then acidified.\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a directed aldol addition. LDA deprotonates cyclohexanone to form the kinetic lithium enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. The final acidic workup protonates the intermediate to give a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is 2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters (at C2 of the ring and at the alcohol carbon, Cα). The reaction of the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with benzaldehyde is known to be *anti*-selective. This means the major product is the *anti*-diastereomer, which exists as a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will follow one of these, the (2R, αS) isomer, through the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an *excess* of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reactions:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of excess reagent ensures that both the ketone and the alcohol functional groups will react.\n    *   The ketone (C=O) at C1 is converted to a geminal difluoride (CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol (-OH) at Cα is converted to a fluoride (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n3.  **Structure of Product 2:** The final product's structure is 2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Final Stereochemistry**\n\n1.  We start with the major aldol product, the (2R, αS) enantiomer.\n2.  The reaction at the C1 ketone does not affect the stereocenter at C2, so it remains **(R)**.\n3.  The reaction at the Cα alcohol proceeds with inversion. The initial **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n4.  Therefore, the major final product is the **(2R, αR)** stereoisomer (and its enantiomer, (2S, αS)). The relative stereochemistry is (R*, R*).\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe must find the option that matches the (R, R) stereochemistry.\n\n*   **A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This option describes a product with the correct functional groups (geminal difluoride and a single fluoride).

The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the reaction of a lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with an aldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. This is due to the steric constraints of the chair-like transition state.

The *anti* product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers (where α denotes the benzylic carbon bearing the hydroxyl group). We will follow one of these enantiomers, **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**, through the next step.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Function of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups—the ketone and the alcohol—will react.\n    *   DAST converts ketones (C=O) to geminal difluorides (-CF₂).\n    *   DAST converts secondary alcohols (-OH) to alkyl fluorides (-F). This reaction typically proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter (Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n3.  **Transformation of Product 1:**\n    *   The ketone at C1 of the cyclohexanone ring is converted to a 1,1-difluoro group. This does not affect the stereocenter at C2.\n    *   The secondary alcohol on the side chain is converted to a fluoride.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 2:**\n    *   We start with the (2R, αS) enantiomer of Product 1.\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 of the ring is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at the benzylic alcohol (α-carbon) has an (S) configuration. The reaction with DAST causes inversion, so the configuration becomes **(R)**.\n    *   Therefore, the resulting product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The other enantiomer of Product 1, (2S, αR), would yield the (2S, αS) product. The final product is a racemic mixture of the (R,R) and (S,S) isomers.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Options\n\nWe need to find the option that matches the structure and stereochemistry of the major product, which has a relative stereochemistry of (R*, R*).\n\n*   **A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a molecule with an (R) configuration at the benzylic carbon (the `fluoromethyl` part) and an (R) configuration at the ring carbon to which it is attached. This corresponds to the **(R,R)** isomer we derived as the major product. (Note: There is a common error in the IUPAC numbering in such problems; the product is a 1,1-difluoro derivative, but the stereochemistry is the key determinant).\n*   **B) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This describes the (R,S) isomer. This would be a minor product, as it would derive from the minor *syn*-aldol adduct.\n*   **C) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is an incorrect structure. Excess DAST converts the ketone to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂), not a fluoroalcohol.\n*   **D) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is also an incorrect structure, as the ketone would have been fluorinated by the excess DAST.\n\nThe major product of the reaction sequence has the (R,R) stereochemistry (and its (S,S) enantiomer). Option A correctly describes one of these enantiomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at a low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde and an acidic workup. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The reaction of a pre-formed lithium enolate with an aldehyde at low temperature is highly diastereoselective. According to the Zimmerman-Traxler model, which involves a six-membered chair-like transition state, the reaction preferentially forms the ***anti***-diastereomer. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Function of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups react.\n    *   It converts the ketone (C=O) at C1 into a geminal difluoride (-CF₂).\n    *   It converts the secondary alcohol (-OH) into a fluoride (-F). This reaction typically proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Stereochemistry of Product 2\n\nTo find the major final product, we trace the stereochemistry starting from one of the enantiomers of the major *anti*-aldol product.\n\n1.  Let's start with the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer of Product 1.\n2.  The fluorination of the ketone at C1 does not affect the stereocenter at C2, so its configuration remains **(R)**.\n3.  The fluorination of the secondary alcohol at the α-carbon proceeds with inversion of configuration. Therefore, the **(S)** stereocenter becomes **(R)**.\n4.  The resulting product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The other enantiomer of the starting material, (2S, αR), would yield the (2S, αS) product.\n\nThus, the major final product (Product 2) is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αR) and (2S, αS) stereoisomers of 1,1-difluoro-2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexane.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must find the option that matches the **(R, R)** stereochemistry.\n\n*   **A) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** Incorrect. This is not the final product, as the ketone group has not reacted.\n*   **B) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect. This is a fluoro-alcohol, not the geminal difluoride expected from the reaction of a ketone with excess DAST.\n*   **C) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, S) diastereomer. This would be a minor product, as it would arise from the less-favored *syn*-aldol adduct.\n*   **D) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, R) stereoisomer. This matches one of the enantiomers of the major product derived from the favored *anti*-aldol addition followed by inversion.\n\nAlthough there is a likely numbering error in the IUPAC names provided in options C and D (it should be 1,1-difluoro, not 2,2-difluoro), the stereochemical descriptors are the key to solving the problem. The stereochemistry of the major product is (R, R), which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reagents:** The reaction begins with cyclohexanone, which is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at a low temperature, followed by the addition of benzaldehyde. The reaction mixture is then acidified.\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   The final acidification step protonates the intermediate alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the reaction between the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone and an aldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. This is due to the bulky phenyl group of benzaldehyde preferentially occupying an equatorial position in the chair-like transition state to minimize steric hindrance. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will follow one of these enantiomers, **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**, through the next step.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination)\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reactions:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of an \"excess\" of the reagent ensures that both the ketone and the alcohol functional groups will react.\n    *   **Ketone Fluorination:** The ketone group (C=O) at position C1 of the cyclohexanone ring is converted into a geminal difluoride (-CF₂). This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   **Alcohol Fluorination:** The secondary alcohol group (-OH) is converted into a fluoride (-F). This reaction (deoxyfluorination) proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n\n### Determining the Stereochemistry of Product 2\n\n1.  **Starting Isomer (from Step 1):** We start with the major *anti*-aldol product, specifically the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer.\n2.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 of the cyclohexane ring is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at the benzylic alcohol (the α-carbon) undergoes inversion. The initial **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n3.  **Final Product:** The major product formed is the **(2R, αR)** stereoisomer. The overall reaction produces a racemic mixture of this (2R, αR) product and its (2S, αS) enantiomer.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must find the option that matches the **(R, R)** stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n*   **A) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect because the ketone functional group would have been converted to a difluoride by the excess DAST.\n*   **B) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, S) stereoisomer. This is not the major product derived from the *anti*-aldol addition followed by inversion.\n*   **C) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. Excess DAST converts the ketone to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂), not a fluoroalcohol (-CF(OH)-).\n*   **D) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, R) stereoisomer. This matches the stereochemistry of the major product derived from our step-by-step analysis. (Note: There is a likely numbering error in the IUPAC name provided in the options; the product is a 1,1-difluoro derivative, not 2,2. However, the stereochemical descriptors are the key differentiator).\n\nBased on the analysis, the major product has (R,R) relative stereochemistry, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at a low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde and an acidic workup. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. The reaction of the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with benzaldehyde is known to favor the formation of the ***anti***-diastereomer as the major product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers (where α denotes the benzylic carbon bearing the hydroxyl group).\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Function of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups—the ketone and the alcohol—will react.\n    *   The ketone (C=O) at C1 is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol (-OH) at the α-position is converted to a fluoride (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Stereochemistry of Product 2\n\nTo find the final structure, we trace the stereochemical changes starting from one of the enantiomers of the major *anti*-aldol product, for example, the **(2R, αS)** isomer.\n\n*   The conversion of the ketone at C1 to a -CF₂ group does not affect the stereocenter at C2. Therefore, the C2 configuration remains **(R)**.\n*   The fluorination of the alcohol at the α-carbon occurs with inversion of configuration. Thus, the initial **(S)** configuration inverts to an **(R)** configuration.\n\nThe resulting product is the **(2R, αR)** stereoisomer. The other starting enantiomer, (2S, αR), would similarly yield the (2S, αS) product. Therefore, the major final product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αR) and (2S, αS) isomers.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must now match our predicted product with the given choices.\n\n*   **A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene**\n*   **B) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene**\n*   **C) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**\n*   **D) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol**\n\n1.  **Eliminate Incorrect Functional Groups:** Options C and D are incorrect because they represent incomplete reactions. Excess DAST would have converted both the ketone and the alcohol. Option C retains the ketone, and Option D is a fluoro-alcohol instead of a geminal difluoride.\n2.  **Analyze Stereochemistry:** Options A and B have the correct functional groups. They differ only in their stereochemistry. There is a common typo in the naming (`2,2-difluoro` instead of the correct `1,1-difluoro`), which we will overlook to focus on the critical stereochemical aspect.\n    *   **Option A** describes the **(2R, αR)** isomer. This matches one of the enantiomers of the major product we predicted.\n    *   **Option B** describes the **(2R, αS)** isomer. This diastereomer would not be the major product of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reaction favors the *anti*-aldol product, and the subsequent fluorination of the alcohol proceeds with inversion. This leads to a final product with (R,R) or (S,S) stereochemistry. Option A correctly describes the (R,R) enantiomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reagents:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde, and then acidified.\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a directed aldol addition. LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone to form the kinetic lithium enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. The final acidification step protonates the intermediate alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone, which is Product 1.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is 2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler transition state model. While the simple model for the Z-enolate of cyclohexanone predicts a *syn* product, this reaction is a well-known exception where steric hindrance in the transition state leads to the preferential formation of the ***anti*** **diastereomer** as the major product. The *anti* diastereomer has a relative stereochemistry of (2R*, αR*) or (2S*, αS*). We will follow one of these enantiomers, for example, the **(2R, αR)** isomer, as the major starting material for the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reactions:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups will react.\n    *   The ketone group (C=O) at C1 of the cyclohexanone ring is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol group (-OH) on the side chain is converted to a fluoride (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter (an Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** We trace the stereochemical changes from the major isomer of Product 1.\n    *   Starting material: **(2R, αR)**-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The fluorination of the ketone at C1 does not affect the stereocenter at C2, so it remains **(R)**.\n    *   The fluorination of the alcohol at the α-carbon proceeds with inversion. The configuration changes from **(R)** to **(S)**.\n    *   Therefore, the major enantiomer of Product 2 has the **(2R, αS)** configuration. The final product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) isomers.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe need to find the option that matches the structure and stereochemistry of the major product, which has a relative stereochemistry of (R, S) or (S, R).\n\n*   **A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This describes the (R, R) stereoisomer. This would be the minor product, derived from the *syn*-aldol adduct.\n*   **B) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. The ketone group would have been converted to a difluoride by the excess DAST.\n*   **C) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, S) stereoisomer (the cyclohexyl ring stereocenter is R, and the benzylic stereocenter is S). This matches the stereochemistry of the major product derived from our analysis.\n*   **D) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. The ketone is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂), not a fluoro-alcohol.\n\nThe correct structure is the one derived from the major *anti*-aldol product followed by inversion at the alcohol center, which results in the (R, S) relative stereochemistry. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde, and then acidified. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at an α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   Acidification protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone, which is **Product 1**. The structure is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the reaction between the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone and an aldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. This is due to the chair-like transition state arranging itself to minimize steric interactions, placing the bulky phenyl group in an equatorial-like position, which leads to the *anti* configuration. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. For the next step, we will follow one of these enantiomers, for example, **(2R)-2-((S)-hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Function of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups (the ketone and the alcohol) will react.\n    *   DAST converts ketones (C=O) to geminal difluorides (-CF₂).\n    *   DAST converts secondary alcohols (-OH) to alkyl fluorides (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Transformation of Product 1:**\n    *   The ketone at C1 of the cyclohexanone ring is converted to a 1,1-difluoro group (-CF₂). This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at C2.\n    *   The secondary alcohol on the side chain is converted to a fluoride, and its stereocenter is inverted.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 2:**\n    *   We start with the (2R, αS) enantiomer of Product 1.\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 of the ring remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at the benzylic alcohol, which was (S), inverts to **(R)**.\n    *   Therefore, the resulting product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The reaction produces a racemic mixture of this (R,R) product and its (S,S) enantiomer.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Options\n\nWe need to find the option that matches the **(R,R)** stereoisomer.\n\n*   **A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a molecule with an (R) configuration at the benzylic carbon (`(R)-...fluoromethyl`) and an (R) configuration at the ring carbon to which it is attached (`(R)-...cyclohexyl`). This corresponds to the **(R,R)** isomer we predicted. (Note: There is a common typo in such problems where the product `1,1-difluoro-2-substituted-cyclohexane` is named as a `2,2-difluoro` derivative. We focus on the stereochemistry, which is the key differentiator).\n*   **B) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. The ketone is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂), not a fluoroalcohol (-CF(OH)-).\n*   **C) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This describes the **(R,S)** isomer (R on the ring, S on the side chain). This would be the product if the fluorination occurred with retention of configuration, which is not the standard mechanism for DAST.\n*   **D) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. The ketone functional group would have been converted to a difluoride by the excess DAST.\n\nBased on the analysis, the major product has (R,R) stereochemistry, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction Type:** The first step involves treating cyclohexanone with Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by the addition of benzaldehyde, and finally an acidic workup. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates the α-carbon of cyclohexanone to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product of this aldol addition is a β-hydroxy ketone, specifically **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is governed by the Zimmerman-Traxler transition state model. For the reaction of the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with benzaldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers (where α refers to the benzylic carbon). For the purpose of tracking the stereochemistry, we will follow one of these enantiomers, the **(2R, αS)** isomer.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction Type:** Product 1 is treated with an *excess* of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST). DAST is a fluorinating agent.\n2.  **Reactivity of DAST:** The use of \"excess\" DAST is a critical detail, indicating that it will react with all susceptible functional groups in the molecule.\n    *   DAST converts ketones (C=O) to geminal difluorides (-CF₂).\n    *   DAST converts secondary alcohols (-OH) to alkyl fluorides (-F). This reaction, known as deoxofluorination, proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Transformation of Product 1:**\n    *   The ketone group at C1 of the cyclohexanone ring is converted to a 1,1-difluoro group. This transformation does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   The secondary alcohol on the side chain is converted to a fluoride.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Stereochemistry of Product 2\n\n1.  We start with the major aldol product, the **(2R, αS)**-enantiomer.\n2.  The stereocenter at C2 of the ring is unaffected by the reactions and remains **(R)**.\n3.  The stereocenter at the alcohol (the α-carbon) undergoes inversion of configuration during fluorination. Therefore, the initial **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n4.  The resulting major product is the **(2R, αR)** enantiomer. The overall reaction produces a racemic mixture of the (2R, αR) and (2S, αS) products. The key feature is that the relative stereochemistry of the two centers is (R,R) or (S,S).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must find the option that matches the structure and stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n*   **A) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect.

This is not the major product.\n*   **C) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** Incorrect. This product still contains a ketone, which would have been fluorinated by excess DAST.\n*   **D) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (2R, αR) stereoisomer. This matches the stereochemistry of the major product derived from the *anti*-aldol addition followed by inversion at the alcohol center.\n\nNote: There is a likely typographical error in the IUPAC names provided in options B and D. The reaction produces a 1,1-difluoro group at the former carbonyl position (C1), so the product is a substituted 1,1-difluorocyclohexane. The options name it as a 2,2-difluorocyclohexyl derivative. Assuming this is a typo in the question, the stereochemical descriptors are the deciding factor.\n\nBased on the analysis, the major product has (R,R) stereochemistry, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of Product 2.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reagents:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde, and then acidified.\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at an α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   Acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters. The reaction of the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with an aldehyde is known to be diastereoselective, preferentially forming the ***anti***-diastereomer as the major product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will follow the (2R, αS) enantiomer through the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination and Rearrangement)**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Mechanism:** This step is more complex than a simple double fluorination. It involves three key transformations:\n    *   **a) Fluorodehydroxylation:** The secondary alcohol group is converted to a fluoride. This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** (Sₙ2-like).\n        *   Starting with the (2R, αS)-alcohol, this step yields an intermediate α-fluoroketone with (2R, αR) stereochemistry: (2R)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **b) DAST-induced Rearrangement:** α-fluoroketones are known to undergo rearrangement in the presence of DAST. The carbonyl at C1 is activated, followed by a 1,2-migration of the substituent from C2 to C1. The ketone functionality effectively moves from C1 to C2.\n        *   The `(R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl` group migrates from C2 to C1. The stereochemistry of the migrating group is retained.\n        *   This forms a new ketone intermediate: (1R)-1-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-2-one. The stereochemistry at C1 is established during the migration, and the stereocenter at C2 is lost as it becomes a carbonyl.\n    *   **c) Geminal Difluorination:** The excess DAST then reacts with the newly formed ketone at C2, converting the C=O group into a CF₂ group. This does not affect the existing stereocenters.\n3.  **Structure and Stereochemistry of Product 2:** The final product is **(1R)-1-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-2,2-difluorocyclohexane**. This product has an (R) configuration at the benzylic carbon and an (R) configuration at C1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Step 3: Matching the Product with the Options**\n\nThe options must be carefully analyzed. The IUPAC names provided are unconventional but describe the stereochemistry.\n\n*   **A) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a product with (R) stereochemistry on the ring and (S) stereochemistry on the side chain. This would be the minor product, derived from the *syn*-aldol adduct.\n*   **B) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is an intermediate, not the final product, as the ketone would have reacted with excess DAST.\n*   **C) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a product where the benzylic carbon (`fluoromethyl`) is (R) and the ring carbon it's attached to (`cyclohexyl`) is also (R). This corresponds to the (1R, αR) stereochemistry we derived for the major product from the rearrangement pathway. The `2,2-difluoro` locant in the name correctly matches the position of the difluoro group in the rearranged product.\n*   **D) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is a fluoroalcohol, not the geminal difluoride expected from the reaction of a ketone with excess DAST.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction proceeds through an *anti*-selective aldol addition, followed by a fluorination/rearrangement/fluorination sequence with DAST. This pathway leads to the (R, R) stereoisomer as the major product. Option C correctly describes this stereoisomer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct structure of product 2.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde, and then acidified. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA is a strong, bulky base that deprotonates cyclohexanone at an α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   Acidification protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The reaction of a pre-formed lithium enolate of a cyclic ketone (like cyclohexanone) with an aldehyde at low temperature is known to be diastereoselective. According to the Zimmerman-Traxler model, this reaction preferentially forms the ***anti***-diastereomer as the major product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will track one of these enantiomers, for example, **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**, through the next step.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination)\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reagent's Function:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent is a critical detail, indicating that all susceptible functional groups will react.\n    *   DAST converts ketones (C=O) to geminal difluorides (-CF₂).\n    *   DAST converts alcohols (-OH) to alkyl fluorides (-F). This reaction typically proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Structural Transformation:**\n    *   The ketone at C1 of Product 1 is converted to a 1,1-difluoro group.\n    *   The secondary alcohol on the side chain is converted to a fluoride.\n    *   The final structure is **2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane**.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Final Stereochemistry\n\nWe will trace the stereochemical changes starting from the major *anti*-aldol product, the (2R, αS) enantiomer.\n\n*   The reaction at the C1 ketone does not affect the stereocenter at C2. Therefore, the **(R)** configuration at C2 is retained.\n*   The fluorination of the secondary alcohol at the benzylic position (α-carbon) proceeds with inversion of configuration. The initial **(S)** configuration inverts to an **(R)** configuration.\n\nThus, the major product formed is the **(2R, αR)** stereoisomer (and its enantiomer, the (2S, αS) isomer). The key is that the relative stereochemistry of the two centers is (R,R) or (S,S).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Options\n\nFirst, we eliminate options with incorrect functional groups. Excess DAST reacts with both the ketone and the alcohol.\n*   B) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one: Incorrect. The ketone group would have reacted.\n*   D) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. The ketone becomes a geminal difluoride, not a fluoroalcohol, and the alcohol would have reacted.\n\nThis leaves options A and C. Both describe the correct functional groups but have different stereochemistry. There is a likely numbering error in the IUPAC names provided (2,2-difluoro instead of the correct 1,1-difluoro), so we must rely on the stereochemical descriptors (R/S) to make the final decision.\n\n*   **A) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the isomer with **(R)** configuration at the ring stereocenter and **(S)** configuration at the side chain stereocenter. This is the (R, S) diastereomer.\n*   **C) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the isomer with **(R)** configuration at the ring stereocenter and **(R)** configuration at the side chain stereocenter. This is the (R, R) diastereomer.\n\nOur analysis concluded that the major product has the (R, R) relative stereochemistry. Therefore, option C correctly represents one of the enantiomers of the major product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reagents:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde, and then acidified.\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   Acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone, which is Product 1.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The reaction of a pre-formed lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with an aldehyde is known to be diastereoselective, preferentially forming the ***anti***-diastereomer as the major product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers (where α denotes the benzylic carbon bearing the hydroxyl group). For the subsequent analysis, we will follow one of these enantiomers, for example, **(2R, αS)**.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reactions:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups react.\n    *   **Ketone Fluorination:** The ketone group (C=O) at C1 is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂). This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   **Alcohol Fluorination:** The secondary alcohol (-OH) is converted to a fluoride (-F). This reaction (deoxyfluorination) proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** We trace the stereochemical changes starting from the (2R, αS) enantiomer of Product 1.\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 of the cyclohexane ring is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at the benzylic alcohol (α-carbon) undergoes inversion. The initial **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n4.  **Final Product:** The major product formed is the **(2R, αR)** stereoisomer (and its enantiomer, the (2S, αS) isomer). The structure is 2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must now match our derived product, the (R, R) isomer, with the given options.\n\n*   **A) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. It is a fluoroalcohol, but excess DAST converts the ketone to a geminal difluoride.\n*   **B) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, S) stereoisomer. This is a diastereomer of our product and is not the major product formed.\n*   **C) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, R) stereoisomer. This perfectly matches the stereochemistry of the major product derived from our analysis. (Note: The \"2,2-difluoro\" is a likely typo in the question and should be \"1,1-difluoro\", but the stereochemical descriptors are the key differentiator).\n*   **D) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. It is an α-fluoroketone, but the ketone would have also reacted with the excess DAST.\n\nBased on the well-established stereochemical outcomes of the aldol addition and DAST fluorination, the major product has (R, R) relative stereochemistry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Aldol Addition Reaction (Formation of Product 1)\n\n1.  **Reagents:** The reaction begins with cyclohexanone, which is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at a low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde. The mixture is then acidified.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA is a strong, bulky base that deprotonates the α-carbon of cyclohexanone to form a lithium enolate. This enolate is the nucleophile.\n    *   The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde in an aldol addition reaction.\n    *   The final acidification step protonates the intermediate alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The constitutional structure of Product 1 is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is governed by the Zimmerman-Traxler transition state model. For the reaction of a lithium enolate of a cyclic ketone like cyclohexanone with an aldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. The *anti*-product has a relative stereochemistry of (2R*, αS*). This means the product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers.\n\n### Step 2: Fluorination with DAST (Formation of Product 2)\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Mechanism:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both the ketone and alcohol functional groups react.\n    *   **Ketone Fluorination:** The ketone group (C=O) at position C1 is converted into a geminal difluoride (CF₂). This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   **Alcohol Fluorination:** The secondary alcohol group (-OH) is converted into a fluoride (-F). This reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the chiral center.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Stereochemistry of Product 2\n\nTo find the structure of the major final product, we trace the stereochemistry from the major *anti*-aldol product formed in Step 1.\n\n1.  Let's consider one enantiomer of the major *anti*-product: **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n2.  During the reaction with excess DAST:\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 of the cyclohexane ring is unaffected. It remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at the alcohol (the α-carbon), which has an (S) configuration, undergoes inversion. The (S) configuration becomes **(R)**.\n3.  Therefore, the resulting major product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The reaction produces a racemic mixture of this (2R, αR) product and its (2S, αS) enantiomer. The key is that the relative stereochemistry of the two centers is (R*, R*).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must now find the option that matches the **(R, R)** stereochemistry.\n\n*   **A) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. The product is not a fluoro-alcohol; the ketone is converted to a geminal difluoride by excess DAST.\n*   **B) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a molecule with an (R) configuration at the ring stereocenter and an (R) configuration at the benzylic stereocenter. This **(R, R)** configuration matches our analysis of the major reaction pathway. (Note: The name contains a common typo, \"2,2-difluoro\" instead of the correct \"1,1-difluoro\", but the stereochemical descriptors are the deciding factor).\n*   **C) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. The product does not contain a ketone group, as it would have reacted with the excess DAST.\n*   **D) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, S) stereoisomer. This would be the minor product, as it would arise from the minor *syn*-aldol adduct.\n\nThe question asks for the structure of product 2, which is conventionally the major product of the reaction sequence. Based on the analysis, the major product has (R, R) relative stereochemistry.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",
