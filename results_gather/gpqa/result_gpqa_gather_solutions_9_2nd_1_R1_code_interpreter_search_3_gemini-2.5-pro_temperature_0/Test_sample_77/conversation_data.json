This is because electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, $c$. The retarded time is defined by the condition that the time delay equals the light travel time: $t - t_r = d/c$, where $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ is the distance from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observer.\n\n2.  **Recall or Derive the Standard Formulas:** The standard textbook formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    All quantities in the brackets (d, $\\vec{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n3.  **Manipulate to Match the Options' Format:** The options are presented in a slightly different algebraic form.

However, they provide different final letter answers (A, B, C, or D). This indicates that the options were likely shuffled for each agent. The consensus is on the mathematical form of the potentials, not the letter choice. Based on the options provided in this specific problem, the correct formulas correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The solution involves recognizing the standard formulas and matching them to the provided options, paying close attention to the notation.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The potentials from a moving charge are not instantaneous. Due to the finite speed of light `c`, the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. The problem defines all the necessary variables based on this retarded time.\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas:** The standard textbook expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    All quantities on the right-hand side are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$, consistent with the problem's notation.\n\n3.  **Match the Formula's Form to the Options:** The options provided have a slightly different algebraic structure in the denominator. We can manipulate the standard form to match them. Let's focus on the denominator term:\n    $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n    By finding a common denominator, this becomes:\n    $\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n4.  **Substitute the New Denominator Form:** Now, substitute this back into the potential equations:\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**: Incorrect. This uses the static potential form, which neglects retardation effects.\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**: Correct. These expressions exactly match our derived formulas.\n    *   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**: Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. The negative sign is physically crucial and accounts for the Doppler-like effect of the moving source. A positive sign would correspond to a non-causal \"advanced\" potential.\n    *   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**: Incorrect. This uses the static potential and an incorrect relation for the vector potential.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Retardation is Essential:** The potentials depend on the state of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$, not the present time $t$. This means the distance used is `d`, not `r`, and the velocity is $\\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n*   **The Denominator Factor:** The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is the key feature of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, distinguishing them from static potentials. It correctly describes how the potential is modified by the charge's velocity relative to the observer.\n*   **Relationship between V and A:** The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$. The expressions in option B correctly satisfy this relationship, as shown by using the identity $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0\\epsilon_0)$.\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation and comparison, option B is the only one that correctly represents the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis task requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the core physics concept:** The problem is about the electromagnetic potentials generated by a moving point charge. This requires accounting for the finite speed of light, a concept known as retardation. The potentials at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ depend on the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time $t_r$.\n\n2.  **Recall or derive the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:** The standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    All quantities in the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The notation used here matches the problem description.\n\n3.  **Reformat the expressions:** To match the format of the given options, we can manipulate the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the entire expression by $c$:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   **A)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        *   This is incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator corresponds to an \"advanced potential,\" which is a non-physical solution that violates causality.\n    *   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        *   This is incorrect. The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge or the retardation of the field.\n    *   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        *   This exactly matches the correctly derived expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials. The minus sign in the denominator is crucial and arises from the Doppler-like effect of the moving source.\n    *   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        *   This is incorrect.

This is a classic problem in electromagnetism, and the solutions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key physical principle is **retardation**: because electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed `c`, the potentials at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the charge's position and velocity at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$.\n\n2.  **Define Variables based on the Problem Statement:**\n    *   $q$: The point charge.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position of the observer (field point).\n    *   $t$: The time of observation.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observer.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observer.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   The retarded time condition is given by $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **Recall or Derive the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The standard textbook formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\n4.  **Manipulate the Expressions to Match the Options:** The options provided have a slightly different algebraic form. We can obtain this form by manipulating the denominator of the standard expressions.\n    *   The denominator is $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$.\n    *   Factoring out $1/c$, we get: $\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$.\n    *   Substituting this back into the potential formulas:\n        *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n        *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, ...**\n        This is incorrect.

It contains a crucial correction factor, $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$, which accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect on the potential.\n*   The sign in this correction factor is negative. This means that if the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the denominator gets smaller, and the potential gets larger.\n*   The relationship $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$ holds for the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which is satisfied by the expressions in option A.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe step-by-step derivation and comparison show that only the expressions in option A are correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem deals with the electromagnetic potentials generated by a moving point charge.

The analysis involves deriving the correct formulas and comparing them against the given options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **The Core Concept: Retarded Time**\n    The fundamental principle is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` are not determined by the charge's current state, but by its state at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. This time is defined by the condition that the signal emitted at $t_r$ from the charge's position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ arrives at $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`. Using the notation from the problem:\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the retarded position to the observer.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the distance the signal travels.\n    *   The time delay is $d/c$.\n    *   The retarded time condition is: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n2.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**\n    The standard derivation of the potentials from Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. In their common form, they are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\n    All quantities in the brackets ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n3.  **Matching the Formula to the Options**\n    The given options have a slightly different algebraic structure in the denominator. We can obtain this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the standard expressions by `c`:\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q \\cdot c}{(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) \\cdot c} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) \\cdot c} = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Options**\n    Comparing these derived expressions with the provided options:\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**: This option perfectly matches the derived correct expressions.\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**: This is incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator corresponds to \"advanced potentials,\" which are non-physical solutions that violate causality.\n    *   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**: This is incorrect. It uses the static Coulomb potential, which ignores retardation effects. The expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also dimensionally incorrect.\n    *   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**: This is incorrect. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the base expression for V is the static potential, which is wrong.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Retardation is essential:** The potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time $t_r$. Any formula based on instantaneous position or the static Coulomb law (like in options C and D) is incorrect for a moving charge.\n*   **The denominator is key:** The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect. If the charge moves toward the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the denominator gets smaller, and the potential is stronger.\n*   **The sign is negative:** The minus sign in the denominator is a direct result of the derivation and the physics of retardation. A plus sign (Option B) is incorrect for physical, causal fields.\n\nBased on a rigorous derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials and a careful comparison with the given choices, Option A is the only one that correctly represents both the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The potentials from a moving charge are not instantaneous. Due to the finite speed of light `c`, the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. The problem defines all the necessary variables based on this principle.\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas:** The standard textbook expressions for the potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    All quantities on the right side are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$, and the notation matches the problem description.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Denominator:** The crucial part of these expressions is the denominator, $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$.\n    *   This is not the simple static distance. It includes a correction term that accounts for the motion of the source.\n    *   The negative sign is physically significant. It arises from the derivation and leads to a Doppler-like effect: the potential is stronger if the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$) and weaker if it is moving away.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   **Options A and D** are incorrect. They use the form for the static potential, $V = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}$, which does not account for the retardation effects from the charge's motion.\n    *   **Option B** has a plus sign ($+$) in the denominator: $(d c + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. This is physically incorrect and would correspond to a non-causal \"advanced potential\".\n    *   **Option C** has a minus sign ($-$) in the denominator: $(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. This matches the correct physical description.\n\n5.  **Algebraic Formatting:** To confirm that Option C is the correct choice, we can reformat the standard expressions to match the options. We can factor `c` out of the denominator:\n    $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Substituting this back into the potential formulas:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These expressions exactly match those given in Option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   **Retardation is essential:** The potentials depend on the charge's state at the retarded time $t_r$, not the observation time $t$.\n*   **The denominator is key:** The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is the defining feature of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, distinguishing them from static potentials.\n*   **The sign is crucial:** The negative sign in the denominator is correct and represents the physical reality of retardation and the Doppler effect. A positive sign is incorrect.\n*   **Relationship between V and A:** For Liénard-Wiechert potentials, it is known that $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. This relationship holds for the expressions in Option C, providing an additional verification of their correctness.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, Option C is the only one that correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct scalar and vector potentials for the moving point charge.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. In classical electrodynamics, these are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n2.  **The Concept of Retarded Time:** A crucial concept is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the potentials measured at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` are not determined by the charge's state at time `t`, but by its state at an earlier, or **retarded time**, $t_r$. The time difference $t - t_r$ is precisely the time it took for the signal to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observer. Using the notation from the problem, this is expressed as $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **Standard Formulas for Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The standard textbook formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n    In these formulas, all quantities on the right-hand side ($d$, $\\vec{d}$, and $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.

We can obtain this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the standard expressions by `c`:\n    *   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q \\cdot c}{(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) \\cdot c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) \\cdot c} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**\n        This option **perfectly matches** the derived expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials.\n\n    *   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**\n        This is incorrect.

These are known in classical electrodynamics as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. The key principle is **retardation**: the potentials at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier time, $t_r$, called the retarded time. This is because the electromagnetic influence propagates at the finite speed of light, $c$.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Variables\nThe problem provides the following notation:\n*   $q$: The point charge.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: The observation point.\n*   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n*   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   $d$: The magnitude of this vector, $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   The retarded time condition is $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n### Step 3: Recall or Derive the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\nThe standard textbook formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n*   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n*   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nThe quantities in the brackets are all evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### Step 4: Manipulate the Expressions to Match the Options\nThe given options have a slightly different algebraic form. We can obtain this form by manipulating the denominator of the standard expressions. Let's find a common denominator of $c$:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the potential formulas:\n*   **For V:**\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n*   **For $\\vec{A}$:**\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Given Options\nLet's carefully check the options against our derived expressions:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    *   This is incorrect. The sign in the denominator is `+`, which would correspond to an unphysical \"advanced potential\" that violates causality. The correct sign is `-`.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    *   This is incorrect. The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge or the retardation effect.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    *   This is incorrect for the same reason as B (V is the static potential), and the relation for $\\vec{A}$ is also wrong.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    *   This option perfectly matches the derived expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials.

Therefore, the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the charge's state (its position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, `tr`.\n\n2.  **Define Key Quantities:**\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is defined by the light-travel-time condition: $t - t_r = d/c$, where $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ is the distance from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n\n3.  **Recall the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The standard derivation from Maxwell's equations yields the following formulas for the potentials:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n4.  **Reformat the Expressions:** To match the format of the given options, we can manipulate the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the entire expression by `c`:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect. The expression for V is the static potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge or the retardation of the field.\n    *   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is positive (`+`). The correct derivation yields a negative sign (`-`). The sign is crucial; a positive sign would correspond to a non-physical \"advanced potential\" that violates causality.\n    *   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect. This also uses the static potential for V and has a dimensionally incorrect formula for A.\n    *   **D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: **Correct**. These expressions exactly match the correctly derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows a unanimous agreement on the correct physical formulas, even though their final letter choices differ due to inconsistent labeling of the options they were presented with. The correct physics corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The core physical principle is that of retardation: the potentials at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time $t_r$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Correct Physical Model**: The question describes a classic scenario in electrodynamics. For a moving point charge, the simple static Coulomb potential is insufficient. We must use the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a point charge in motion.\n\n2.  **Standard Form of Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**: The standard textbook expressions for the potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    All quantities in the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The notation used here ($q, \\vec{d}, d, \\vec{v}, c, \\epsilon_o, \\mu_o$) is consistent with the problem statement.\n\n3.  **Algebraic Manipulation**: The options in the question are presented in a slightly different algebraic form. We can obtain this form by manipulating the denominator of the standard expressions. Let's factor out $1/c$ from the denominator:\n    $d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n\n4.  **Final Expressions**: Substituting this back into the standard formulas gives:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Comparison with Options**:\n    *   **Option A & B**: These are incorrect because they use the static potential form $V \\propto q/r$, which neglects the crucial retardation effects captured by the denominator $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$.\n    *   **Option D**: This option has a plus sign ($+$) in the denominator. The correct sign is minus ($-$). The minus sign is physically significant, as it accounts for the Doppler-like effect: the potential is strengthened if the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$) and weakened if it moves away. A plus sign corresponds to non-physical \"advanced potentials\" that violate causality.\n    *   **Option C**: The expressions for both $V(\\vec{r},t)$ and $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t)$ in this option perfectly match our derived formulas.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are given by the Liénard-Wiechert formulas. After algebraic manipulation, these formulas match option C. The majority of the provided candidate answers, despite some confusion in labeling the final choice, correctly derive these physical formulas.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct scalar and vector potentials for the moving point charge.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge. Because the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, `c`, the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` are determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, or **retarded**, time $t_r$. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n2.  **Define Variables:** The problem provides the following notation:\n    *   $t_r$: The retarded time, when the signal was emitted.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge `q` at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   $d$: The magnitude of this vector, $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   The retarded time condition is $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **Standard Form of Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The standard textbook expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\n    The term in the denominator, often written as $d(1 - \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)$ where $\\hat{n} = \\vec{d}/d$, accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source.\n\n4.  **Algebraic Manipulation:** To match the format of the given options, we can manipulate the denominator of the standard expressions by finding a common denominator:\n    $d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Substituting this back into the potential equations gives:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Comparison with Options:** Now, we compare these derived expressions with the provided options.\n\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This option perfectly matches our derived expressions.\n\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This is incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator corresponds to an \"advanced potential,\" a non-physical solution that violates causality.\n\n    *   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        This is incorrect. It uses the static potential form, which does not account for the motion of the charge or the retardation of the field. The expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also dimensionally incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        This is also incorrect.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The analysis involves a careful application of electromagnetic theory, specifically accounting for the finite speed of light.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Core Concept: Retarded Potentials**\n    The electromagnetic field does not appear instantaneously everywhere in space. Instead, it propagates at the speed of light, `c`. This means the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` are determined by the charge's properties (position and velocity) at an earlier time, known as the **retarded time**, $t_r$. The time difference $t - t_r$ is the time it took for the field to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observer. This is expressed by the relation:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c} = \\frac{d}{c}$\n    where $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point, and $d$ is its magnitude.\n\n2.  **Derivation of Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\n    The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from the general integral solutions for potentials from a time-varying source. For a point charge, these integrals evaluate to:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\n    All quantities in the brackets ($d$, $\\vec{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n3.  **Matching the Formula to the Options**\n    The expressions in the options have a slightly different algebraic form. We can obtain this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the standard expressions by `c`:\n    *   **Denominator:** $c \\times (d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) = dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$\n    *   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q \\cdot c}{(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) \\cdot c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) \\cdot c} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Candidate Options**\n    Now we compare these correct, derived expressions with the given choices:\n\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        This is incorrect. The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which neglects all effects of motion and retardation. The expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also incorrect and dimensionally flawed.\n\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})**\n        This option perfectly matches the derived expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials.\n\n    *   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})**\n        This is incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator is physically wrong for retarded potentials. It would correspond to an \"advanced potential,\" which violates causality (the effect would precede the cause). The minus sign correctly describes that the potential is stronger if the charge is moving towards the observer.\n\n    *   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        This is incorrect. As in option A, the expression for V is the static potential, which is wrong for a moving charge. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, applying it to an incorrect V yields an incorrect $\\vec{A}$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a rigorous derivation from first principles, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are those presented in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which describe the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **The Core Concept: Retarded Potentials**\n    The fundamental principle is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the potentials measured at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` are not determined by the charge's current state, but by its state at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. This retarded time is defined by the condition that the time elapsed, $t - t_r$, is equal to the time it took for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observer. Using the notation from the problem, this is expressed as $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n2.  **Standard Form of Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\n    The standard derivation from Maxwell's equations yields the following expressions for the potentials, where all quantities describing the charge ($\\vec{s}$, $\\vec{v}$, $\\vec{d}$, $d$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\n3.  **Algebraic Manipulation to Match Options**\n    The options provided in the question use a slightly different algebraic form. We can obtain this form by manipulating the denominator of the standard expressions.

However, they provide different final letter answers (A, B, C, or D). This indicates that the options were likely shuffled for each agent. The consensus is on the mathematical form of the potentials, not the letter choice. Based on the options provided in this specific problem, the correct formulas correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The solution involves recognizing the standard formulas and matching them to the provided options, paying close attention to the notation.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The potentials from a moving charge are not instantaneous. Due to the finite speed of light `c`, the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. The problem defines all the necessary variables based on this retarded time.\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas:** The standard textbook expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    All quantities on the right-hand side are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$, consistent with the problem's notation.\n\n3.  **Match the Formula's Form to the Options:** The options provided have a slightly different algebraic structure in the denominator. We can manipulate the standard form to match them. Let's focus on the denominator term:\n    $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n    By finding a common denominator, this becomes:\n    $\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n4.  **Substitute the New Denominator Form:** Now, substitute this back into the potential equations:\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**: Incorrect. This uses the static potential form, which neglects retardation effects.\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**: Correct. These expressions exactly match our derived formulas.\n    *   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**: Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. The negative sign is physically crucial and accounts for the Doppler-like effect of the moving source. A positive sign would correspond to a non-causal \"advanced\" potential.\n    *   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**: Incorrect. This uses the static potential and an incorrect relation for the vector potential.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Retardation is Essential:** The potentials depend on the state of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$, not the present time $t$. This means the distance used is `d`, not `r`, and the velocity is $\\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n*   **The Denominator Factor:** The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is the key feature of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, distinguishing them from static potentials. It correctly describes how the potential is modified by the charge's velocity relative to the observer.\n*   **Relationship between V and A:** The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$. The expressions in option B correctly satisfy this relationship, as shown by using the identity $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0\\epsilon_0)$.\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation and comparison, option B is the only one that correctly represents the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis task requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the core physics concept:** The problem is about the electromagnetic potentials generated by a moving point charge.

The plus sign in the denominator corresponds to an \"advanced potential,\" which is a non-physical solution that violates causality.\n    *   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        *   This is incorrect. The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge or the retardation of the field.\n    *   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        *   This exactly matches the correctly derived expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials.

This is a classic problem in electromagnetism, and the solutions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key physical principle is **retardation**: because electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed `c`, the potentials at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the charge's position and velocity at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$.\n\n2.  **Define Variables based on the Problem Statement:**\n    *   $q$: The point charge.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position of the observer (field point).\n    *   $t$: The time of observation.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observer.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observer.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   The retarded time condition is given by $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **Recall or Derive the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The standard textbook formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\n4.  **Manipulate the Expressions to Match the Options:** The options provided have a slightly different algebraic form. We can obtain this form by manipulating the denominator of the standard expressions.\n    *   The denominator is $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$.\n    *   Factoring out $1/c$, we get: $\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$.\n    *   Substituting this back into the potential formulas:\n        *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n        *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, ...**\n        This is incorrect.

While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the base expression for V is the static potential, which is wrong.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Retardation is essential:** The potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time $t_r$. Any formula based on instantaneous position or the static Coulomb law (like in options C and D) is incorrect for a moving charge.\n*   **The denominator is key:** The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect. If the charge moves toward the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the denominator gets smaller, and the potential is stronger.\n*   **The sign is negative:** The minus sign in the denominator is a direct result of the derivation and the physics of retardation. A plus sign (Option B) is incorrect for physical, causal fields.\n\nBased on a rigorous derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials and a careful comparison with the given choices, Option A is the only one that correctly represents both the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The potentials from a moving charge are not instantaneous. Due to the finite speed of light `c`, the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. The problem defines all the necessary variables based on this principle.\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas:** The standard textbook expressions for the potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    All quantities on the right side are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$, and the notation matches the problem description.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Denominator:** The crucial part of these expressions is the denominator, $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$.\n    *   This is not the simple static distance. It includes a correction term that accounts for the motion of the source.\n    *   The negative sign is physically significant. It arises from the derivation and leads to a Doppler-like effect: the potential is stronger if the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$) and weaker if it is moving away.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   **Options A and D** are incorrect. They use the form for the static potential, $V = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}$, which does not account for the retardation effects from the charge's motion.\n    *   **Option B** has a plus sign ($+$) in the denominator: $(d c + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. This is physically incorrect and would correspond to a non-causal \"advanced potential\".\n    *   **Option C** has a minus sign ($-$) in the denominator: $(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. This matches the correct physical description.\n\n5.  **Algebraic Formatting:** To confirm that Option C is the correct choice, we can reformat the standard expressions to match the options. We can factor `c` out of the denominator:\n    $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Substituting this back into the potential formulas:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These expressions exactly match those given in Option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   **Retardation is essential:** The potentials depend on the charge's state at the retarded time $t_r$, not the observation time $t$.\n*   **The denominator is key:** The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is the defining feature of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, distinguishing them from static potentials.\n*   **The sign is crucial:** The negative sign in the denominator is correct and represents the physical reality of retardation and the Doppler effect. A positive sign is incorrect.\n*   **Relationship between V and A:** For Liénard-Wiechert potentials, it is known that $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. This relationship holds for the expressions in Option C, providing an additional verification of their correctness.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, Option C is the only one that correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct scalar and vector potentials for the moving point charge.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. In classical electrodynamics, these are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n2.  **The Concept of Retarded Time:** A crucial concept is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the potentials measured at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` are not determined by the charge's state at time `t`, but by its state at an earlier, or **retarded time**, $t_r$. The time difference $t - t_r$ is precisely the time it took for the signal to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observer. Using the notation from the problem, this is expressed as $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **Standard Formulas for Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The standard textbook formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n    In these formulas, all quantities on the right-hand side ($d$, $\\vec{d}$, and $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.

A plus sign would correspond to a non-physical \"advanced potential\" that violates causality.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the standard derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expressions in option A are the correct ones.

These are known in classical electrodynamics as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. The key principle is **retardation**: the potentials at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier time, $t_r$, called the retarded time. This is because the electromagnetic influence propagates at the finite speed of light, $c$.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Variables\nThe problem provides the following notation:\n*   $q$: The point charge.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: The observation point.\n*   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n*   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   $d$: The magnitude of this vector, $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   The retarded time condition is $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n### Step 3: Recall or Derive the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\nThe standard textbook formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n*   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n*   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nThe quantities in the brackets are all evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### Step 4: Manipulate the Expressions to Match the Options\nThe given options have a slightly different algebraic form. We can obtain this form by manipulating the denominator of the standard expressions.

These expressions exactly match the correctly derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows a unanimous agreement on the correct physical formulas, even though their final letter choices differ due to inconsistent labeling of the options they were presented with. The correct physics corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The core physical principle is that of retardation: the potentials at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time $t_r$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Correct Physical Model**: The question describes a classic scenario in electrodynamics. For a moving point charge, the simple static Coulomb potential is insufficient. We must use the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a point charge in motion.\n\n2.  **Standard Form of Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**: The standard textbook expressions for the potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    All quantities in the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The notation used here ($q, \\vec{d}, d, \\vec{v}, c, \\epsilon_o, \\mu_o$) is consistent with the problem statement.\n\n3.  **Algebraic Manipulation**: The options in the question are presented in a slightly different algebraic form. We can obtain this form by manipulating the denominator of the standard expressions. Let's factor out $1/c$ from the denominator:\n    $d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n\n4.  **Final Expressions**: Substituting this back into the standard formulas gives:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Comparison with Options**:\n    *   **Option A & B**: These are incorrect because they use the static potential form $V \\propto q/r$, which neglects the crucial retardation effects captured by the denominator $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$.\n    *   **Option D**: This option has a plus sign ($+$) in the denominator. The correct sign is minus ($-$). The minus sign is physically significant, as it accounts for the Doppler-like effect: the potential is strengthened if the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$) and weakened if it moves away. A plus sign corresponds to non-physical \"advanced potentials\" that violate causality.\n    *   **Option C**: The expressions for both $V(\\vec{r},t)$ and $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t)$ in this option perfectly match our derived formulas.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are given by the Liénard-Wiechert formulas. After algebraic manipulation, these formulas match option C. The majority of the provided candidate answers, despite some confusion in labeling the final choice, correctly derive these physical formulas.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct scalar and vector potentials for the moving point charge.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge. Because the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, `c`, the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` are determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, or **retarded**, time $t_r$. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n2.  **Define Variables:** The problem provides the following notation:\n    *   $t_r$: The retarded time, when the signal was emitted.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge `q` at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   $d$: The magnitude of this vector, $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   The retarded time condition is $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **Standard Form of Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The standard textbook expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\n    The term in the denominator, often written as $d(1 - \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)$ where $\\hat{n} = \\vec{d}/d$, accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source.\n\n4.  **Algebraic Manipulation:** To match the format of the given options, we can manipulate the denominator of the standard expressions by finding a common denominator:\n    $d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Substituting this back into the potential equations gives:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Comparison with Options:** Now, we compare these derived expressions with the provided options.\n\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This option perfectly matches our derived expressions.\n\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This is incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator corresponds to an \"advanced potential,\" a non-physical solution that violates causality.\n\n    *   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        This is incorrect. It uses the static potential form, which does not account for the motion of the charge or the retardation of the field. The expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also dimensionally incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        This is also incorrect. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for the scalar potential V is the static one, which is wrong for a moving charge.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are derived from the principle of retarded time and are given by the Liénard-Wiechert formulas. The derivation consistently leads to the expressions listed in option A. The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while their final letter choices were scattered (likely due to shuffled options), the overwhelming majority correctly derived the same physical formulas.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The analysis involves a careful application of electromagnetic theory, specifically accounting for the finite speed of light.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Core Concept: Retarded Potentials**\n    The electromagnetic field does not appear instantaneously everywhere in space. Instead, it propagates at the speed of light, `c`. This means the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` are determined by the charge's properties (position and velocity) at an earlier time, known as the **retarded time**, $t_r$. The time difference $t - t_r$ is the time it took for the field to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observer. This is expressed by the relation:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c} = \\frac{d}{c}$\n    where $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point, and $d$ is its magnitude.\n\n2.  **Derivation of Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\n    The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from the general integral solutions for potentials from a time-varying source. For a point charge, these integrals evaluate to:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\n    All quantities in the brackets ($d$, $\\vec{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n3.  **Matching the Formula to the Options**\n    The expressions in the options have a slightly different algebraic form. We can obtain this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the standard expressions by `c`:\n    *   **Denominator:** $c \\times (d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) = dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$\n    *   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q \\cdot c}{(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) \\cdot c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) \\cdot c} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Candidate Options**\n    Now we compare these correct, derived expressions with the given choices:\n\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        This is incorrect. The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which neglects all effects of motion and retardation. The expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also incorrect and dimensionally flawed.\n\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})**\n        This option perfectly matches the derived expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials.\n\n    *   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})**\n        This is incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator is physically wrong for retarded potentials. It would correspond to an \"advanced potential,\" which violates causality (the effect would precede the cause). The minus sign correctly describes that the potential is stronger if the charge is moving towards the observer.\n\n    *   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        This is incorrect. As in option A, the expression for V is the static potential, which is wrong for a moving charge. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, applying it to an incorrect V yields an incorrect $\\vec{A}$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a rigorous derivation from first principles, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are those presented in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which describe the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **The Core Concept: Retarded Potentials**\n    The fundamental principle is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the potentials measured at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` are not determined by the charge's current state, but by its state at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. This retarded time is defined by the condition that the time elapsed, $t - t_r$, is equal to the time it took for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observer. Using the notation from the problem, this is expressed as $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n2.  **Standard Form of Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\n    The standard derivation from Maxwell's equations yields the following expressions for the potentials, where all quantities describing the charge ($\\vec{s}$, $\\vec{v}$, $\\vec{d}$, $d$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\n3.  **Algebraic Manipulation to Match Options**\n    The options provided in the question use a slightly different algebraic form. We can obtain this form by manipulating the denominator of the standard expressions. By finding a common denominator of `c`, we get:\n    $d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Substituting this back into the potential formulas:\n    *   For V: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   For $\\vec{A}$: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Comparison with the Given Options**\n    Let's compare these derived expressions with the choices:\n    *   A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        *   Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is positive. This corresponds to an \"advanced potential,\" which is physically non-causal.\n    *   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        *   **Correct.** These expressions exactly match the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        *   Incorrect. This uses the static Coulomb potential, which ignores retardation. The expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also dimensionally incorrect.\n    *   D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        *   Incorrect. This also uses the static potential for V. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the base expression for V is wrong.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Retardation is essential:** The potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time $t_r$, not the observation time $t$.\n*   **The denominator is key:** The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect. The potential is stronger if the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$) and weaker if it moves away.\n*   **The sign is negative:** The minus sign in the denominator is a crucial result of the derivation and reflects the physics of retardation. A plus sign would violate causality.\n\nBased on the analysis, the expressions in option B are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",
