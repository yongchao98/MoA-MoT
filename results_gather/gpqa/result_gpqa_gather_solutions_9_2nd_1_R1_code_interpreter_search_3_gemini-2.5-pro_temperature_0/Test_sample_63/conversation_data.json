Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed.

Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases. We can determine the identity and quantity of each gaseous product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate, etc.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase is the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted.\n    *   Molar Mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   This gas is inert to the reagents used. Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nWe can find the total moles of each element (N, H, O) in the original 7.20 g mixture by summing the atoms from the products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (moles of O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass from these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula unit of (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get an integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThis means that the sum of the chemical formulas of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is N₄H₈O₅. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, they are very likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two common salts that add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** → Formula: N₂H₄O₃\n*   **Candidate 2: Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** → Formula: N₂H₄O₂\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite. This identification is consistent regardless of whether the gas reacting with copper was O₂ or N₂O, as both interpretations lead to the same salts.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we sum the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThe total number of atoms is 17. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O. Both possibilities will be considered.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nWe can find the total moles of each element (N, H, O) in the original mixture by summing the atoms from the products.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N comes from the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is present in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (moles of O atoms from tube №3)\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × 0.20 mol) + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's verify the total mass from these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming that salts A and B consist only of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula unit (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get integers, we can multiply by 20, which gives the ratio **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThis means that the sum of the chemical formulas of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is N₄H₈O₅. Since the compounds are salts containing N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts. We need to find two common ammonium salts that add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂). Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\nThis identification is consistent with the decomposition products. The standard decomposition reactions for an equimolar mixture are:\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\nThis would produce N₂, N₂O, and H₂O. The N₂O would then react with the hot copper (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO), consuming the N₂O and producing more N₂. This path is consistent with the experimental results.\n\nAlternatively, the decomposition of ammonium nitrate can also produce N₂, O₂, and H₂O. This path is also consistent with the experimental results. Crucially, both interpretations lead to the same identification of the salts.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means summing the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Products:** I will use the experimental data to determine the chemical nature and amount (in moles) of each gaseous product formed when the salt mixture was heated.\n    *   The weight increase in the tube with Mg(ClO₄)₂ (a drying agent) corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced. I will calculate the moles of H₂O.\n    *   The fact that the weight of the Ca(OH)₂ solution did not change means no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced.\n    *   The weight increase of the red-hot copper is due to its reaction with an oxidizing gas. This increase is the mass of the oxygen atoms captured. I will calculate the moles of O atoms.\n    *   The remaining gas, C, passed through all tubes unreacted. I will calculate its moles from the given volume at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). I will then use mass conservation to confirm its identity, which is likely N₂.\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Mixture:** Based on the moles of H₂O, O atoms, and N₂ gas, I will calculate the total moles of hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N) atoms in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:** From the molar ratio of the elements, I will determine the combined empirical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B. Since the problem states they are salts that decompose into only gaseous products containing N, H, and O, they are almost certainly ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. I will find the two salts whose formulas sum to the derived combined formula.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:** Once salts A and B are identified, I will count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B and sum them up to get the final answer.\n\n5.  **Match to Options:** I will match the final calculated number to the given options to select the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the products and calculate their moles\nmass_H2O = 3.60  # g\nmass_O_atoms = 0.80  # g\nvolume_gas_C_STP = 2.24  # L\n\n# Molar masses and constants\nM_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\nM_O = 15.999    # g/mol\nM_N2 = 28.014   # g/mol\nV_molar_STP = 22.4  # L/mol\n\n# Moles of products\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O\nmoles_O_atoms = mass_O_atoms / M_O\nmoles_gas_C = volume_gas_C_STP / V_molar_STP\n\n# To confirm Gas C is N2, check mass conservation\n# Total initial mass = 7.20 g\n# Mass of Gas C = Total mass - mass(H2O) - mass(O_atoms)\n# Note: The mass increase in tube 3 is just the oxygen, not the whole gas molecule.\n# Let's find the mass of all elements in the products.\n# Mass of H = moles_H2O * 2 * 1.008 = 0.4028 g\n# Mass of O in H2O = moles_H2O * 1 * 15.999 = 3.197 g\n# Mass of O from tube 3 = 0.80 g\n# Total mass of H and O = 0.4028 + 3.197 + 0.80 = 4.4 g\n# Mass of N = 7.20 - 4.4 = 2.8 g\n# Moles of N atoms = 2.8 g / 14.007 g/mol = 0.1999 mol ~= 0.2 mol\n# Moles of N2 gas = 0.2 mol N atoms / 2 = 0.1 mol.\n# This matches moles_gas_C, so Gas C is indeed N2.\n\n# Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the mixture\nmoles_H_total = moles_H2O * 2\nmoles_N_total = moles_gas_C * 2\nmoles_O_total = moles_H2O * 1 + moles_O_atoms\n\n# The molar ratio of elements in the combined formula (A+B) is N:H:O\n# N : H : O  ~=  0.2 : 0.4 : (0.2 + 0.05) = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25\n\n# Step 3: Identify Salts A and B\n# To get an integer ratio, divide by the smallest value (0.2)\n# N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n# Multiply by 4 to get whole numbers\n# N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n# The combined formula for (A+B) is N4H8O5.\n\n# The salts are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n# Two ammonium ions (NH4+) would account for N2H8.\n# Subtracting N2H8 from N4H8O5 leaves N2O5 for the two anions.\n# The two most common nitrogen oxyanions that sum to N2O5 are nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-).\n# So, Salt A is Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3) and Salt B is Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2).\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n# Salt A: NH4NO3 -> N2H4O3\natoms_in_A = 2 + 4 + 3\n# Salt B: NH4NO2 -> N2H4O2\natoms_in_B = 2 + 4 + 2\n\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\n\nprint(f\"The salts are identified as Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3) and Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2).\")\nprint(f\"Number of atoms in NH4NO3: {atoms_in_A}\")\nprint(f\"Number of atoms in NH4NO2: {atoms_in_B}\")\nprint(f\"The total number of all atoms in salts A and B is: {total_atoms}\")\n\n# Step 5: Match to Options\noptions = {'A': 19, 'B': 15, 'C': 13, 'D': 17}\nfinal_choice = None\nfor choice, value in options.items():\n    if value == total_atoms:\n        final_choice = choice\n        break\n\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {final_choice}.\")\n\n# Final Answer Output\nprint(f\"The final answer is {total_atoms}\")\nprint(f\"The correct option is {final_choice}\")\n<<<D>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 80\n    <<<D>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of the decomposition.**\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur that would form acidic oxides.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The problem states CuO is formed, and the tube's mass increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to oxygen atoms bonding with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas (in which case 0.025 mol of O₂ reacted) or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O (in which case 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted).\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the initial salts.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen must be in the final gas, N₂. (Even if the gas reacting with copper was N₂O, it would produce N₂, so the total final N₂ accounts for all nitrogen atoms).\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\nLet's verify the total mass of these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Identify salts A and B.**\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula of (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get a simple integer ratio, divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nTo eliminate the decimal, multiply the entire ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSo, the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, they are very likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The most common and logical candidates are:\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products from the Experimental Data**\n\nThe problem describes the decomposition of a salt mixture and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = 3.60 g, which is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, which means **no acidic gases** were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate, sulfite, etc.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO, meaning the gas passing through contained oxygen atoms that were transferred to the copper.\n    *   Mass increase = mass of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas (in which case 0.025 mol of O₂ reacted) or from an oxygen-containing compound like N₂O (in which case 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted).\n\n*   **Final Gas C:** The remaining gas is inert to all previous reagents.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original salt mixture.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O from H₂O) + (moles of O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen ends up as N₂ gas. We must account for all sources. The final gas is 0.10 mol of N₂. If the gas in tube #3 was N₂O, it would have also produced N₂ (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO). However, regardless of the intermediate steps, the final stable nitrogen product is 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula unit (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get integers, divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiply by 4 to clear the fraction:\nN : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts contain N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, which strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two common salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Formula: **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂.

Analyze the Products and Their Quantities**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO. This mass is purely the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen was delivered by an oxidizing gas in the mixture.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nWe can use the law of conservation of mass to find the composition of the initial 7.20 g mixture. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass.\n*   Total Mass = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O in CuO) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A gas with a molar mass of ~28 g/mol that is inert under these conditions is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition produced 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.10 mol N₂, and an additional 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms that were captured by the copper.\n\nLet's find the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (moles of O atoms captured by Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n\nTo eliminate the decimal, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nThe problem states the initial substance was an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. This means the combined chemical formula of one unit of A and one unit of B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, they are very likely to be ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions (like NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻). Let's test this hypothesis:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated from the experimental data. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products\nThe experiment is designed to separate and identify the gaseous products from the thermal decomposition of the salt mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur that would form acidic oxides.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen was delivered by an oxidizing gas. The two most likely candidates are oxygen gas (O₂) or nitrous oxide (N₂O). Both possibilities will be considered, but as we will see, they lead to the same conclusion.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other gases are removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Determination of the Elemental Composition\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original salt mixture. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the final gas C (N₂) and potentially in the gas that reacted with copper if it was N₂O.\n    *   If the gas in tube #3 was O₂, then all N is in the final 0.10 mol of N₂. Moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   If the gas in tube #3 was N₂O, it would take 0.05 mol of N₂O to deliver 0.05 mol of O atoms. This reaction (Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂) would produce 0.05 mol of N₂. The final 0.10 mol of N₂ would consist of this 0.05 mol plus another 0.05 mol of N₂ produced directly from the decomposition. In this case, the total N atoms are from N₂O (2 × 0.05) and N₂ (2 × 0.05), which is incorrect. The total N atoms in the products are (N from N₂O) + (N from initial N₂) = (2 * 0.05) + (2 * 0.05) = 0.20 mol. Let's re-evaluate: The final gas C is 0.10 mol N₂. If 0.05 mol N₂O reacted, it produced 0.05 mol N₂. This means the other 0.05 mol of N₂ must have been produced directly. The total N atoms are from the 0.05 mol N₂O (0.10 mol N atoms) and the 0.05 mol N₂ (0.10 mol N atoms). This is also 0.20 mol N atoms.\n    *   In both plausible scenarios, the total amount of nitrogen in the original mixture is **0.20 mol of N atoms**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get a simple integer ratio, divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiply by 4 to clear the fraction:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nThe combined formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts contain N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two common salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Formula: **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Formula: **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g equimolar mixture of salts A and B, then passing the resulting gases through a series of tubes. The changes in the tubes allow us to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This rules out salts containing carbonate or other anions that would produce acidic gases.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have been supplied by O₂ gas or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O. As we will see, either assumption leads to the same conclusion about the initial salts.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂), a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the original salts. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the final 0.10 mol of N₂ (and potentially from N₂O if that was the gas in tube 3, but that N₂ would also end up in the final gas C).\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's verify the total mass from these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThis means that the sum of the chemical formulas of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is N₄H₈O₅. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O and decompose into gases, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts in the equimolar mixture are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4.

We can use this data to identify the products and their molar quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂).\n    *   The weight did not change, which means **no acidic gases** were produced. This is a critical clue, ruling out salts containing carbonate, sulfite, etc.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** This tube reacts with an oxidizing gas. The mass increase is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Mass of oxygen atoms (O) gained = 0.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of O is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** This is the gas that did not react in any of the previous tubes.\n    *   Volume at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) = 2.24 L.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2.

Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture is composed of 0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, and 0.25 mol O. The problem states the mixture is **equimolar**. This means the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must have an elemental ratio of:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiplying the entire ratio by 4 gives the integer ratio:\n**N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two common salts (A and B) composed of N, H, and O that decompose into gases and whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The most common salts fitting this description are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**.

Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the salts do not contain elements like carbon that would form acidic oxides.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO, meaning this mass is the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O.

Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts\nWe can find the total moles of each element in the original mixture by summing the atoms from the products. Let's assume the products are H₂O, N₂, and O₂.\n\n*   **Mass of H₂O** = 3.60 g\n*   **Mass of O₂** = 0.80 g\n*   **Mass of N₂** = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass of Products** = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass perfectly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming our product identification. The original salts must be composed only of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total moles of each element:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O -> 2 × 0.20 = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol of N₂ -> 2 × 0.10 = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂ -> (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n### 3. Identify Salts A and B\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSo, the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two common salts containing N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The most likely candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nAdding their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts in the equimolar mixture are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n### 4.

However, the most direct method is to use the conservation of mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Total mass of mixture = 7.20 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass of H - Mass of O = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\nThe initial mixture contained 0.40 mol H, 0.25 mol O, and 0.20 mol N.\n\n### 3. Identify Salts A and B\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains equal moles of salt A and salt B.

Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nWe can find the total moles of each element (N, H, O) in the original 7.20 g mixture by summing the atoms from the products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (moles of O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass from these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula unit of (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get an integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThis means that the sum of the chemical formulas of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is N₄H₈O₅. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, they are very likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two common salts that add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** → Formula: N₂H₄O₃\n*   **Candidate 2: Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** → Formula: N₂H₄O₂\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite. This identification is consistent regardless of whether the gas reacting with copper was O₂ or N₂O, as both interpretations lead to the same salts.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we sum the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThe total number of atoms is 17. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O. Both possibilities will be considered.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nWe can find the total moles of each element (N, H, O) in the original mixture by summing the atoms from the products.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N comes from the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is present in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (moles of O atoms from tube №3)\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × 0.20 mol) + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's verify the total mass from these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming that salts A and B consist only of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula unit (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get integers, we can multiply by 20, which gives the ratio **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThis means that the sum of the chemical formulas of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is N₄H₈O₅. Since the compounds are salts containing N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts. We need to find two common ammonium salts that add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂). Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\nThis identification is consistent with the decomposition products. The standard decomposition reactions for an equimolar mixture are:\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\nThis would produce N₂, N₂O, and H₂O. The N₂O would then react with the hot copper (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO), consuming the N₂O and producing more N₂. This path is consistent with the experimental results.\n\nAlternatively, the decomposition of ammonium nitrate can also produce N₂, O₂, and H₂O. This path is also consistent with the experimental results. Crucially, both interpretations lead to the same identification of the salts.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means summing the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Products:** I will use the experimental data to determine the chemical nature and amount (in moles) of each gaseous product formed when the salt mixture was heated.\n    *   The weight increase in the tube with Mg(ClO₄)₂ (a drying agent) corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced. I will calculate the moles of H₂O.\n    *   The fact that the weight of the Ca(OH)₂ solution did not change means no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced.\n    *   The weight increase of the red-hot copper is due to its reaction with an oxidizing gas. This increase is the mass of the oxygen atoms captured. I will calculate the moles of O atoms.\n    *   The remaining gas, C, passed through all tubes unreacted. I will calculate its moles from the given volume at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). I will then use mass conservation to confirm its identity, which is likely N₂.\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Mixture:** Based on the moles of H₂O, O atoms, and N₂ gas, I will calculate the total moles of hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N) atoms in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:** From the molar ratio of the elements, I will determine the combined empirical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B. Since the problem states they are salts that decompose into only gaseous products containing N, H, and O, they are almost certainly ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. I will find the two salts whose formulas sum to the derived combined formula.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:** Once salts A and B are identified, I will count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B and sum them up to get the final answer.\n\n5.  **Match to Options:** I will match the final calculated number to the given options to select the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the products and calculate their moles\nmass_H2O = 3.60  # g\nmass_O_atoms = 0.80  # g\nvolume_gas_C_STP = 2.24  # L\n\n# Molar masses and constants\nM_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\nM_O = 15.999    # g/mol\nM_N2 = 28.014   # g/mol\nV_molar_STP = 22.4  # L/mol\n\n# Moles of products\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O\nmoles_O_atoms = mass_O_atoms / M_O\nmoles_gas_C = volume_gas_C_STP / V_molar_STP\n\n# To confirm Gas C is N2, check mass conservation\n# Total initial mass = 7.20 g\n# Mass of Gas C = Total mass - mass(H2O) - mass(O_atoms)\n# Note: The mass increase in tube 3 is just the oxygen, not the whole gas molecule.\n# Let's find the mass of all elements in the products.\n# Mass of H = moles_H2O * 2 * 1.008 = 0.4028 g\n# Mass of O in H2O = moles_H2O * 1 * 15.999 = 3.197 g\n# Mass of O from tube 3 = 0.80 g\n# Total mass of H and O = 0.4028 + 3.197 + 0.80 = 4.4 g\n# Mass of N = 7.20 - 4.4 = 2.8 g\n# Moles of N atoms = 2.8 g / 14.007 g/mol = 0.1999 mol ~= 0.2 mol\n# Moles of N2 gas = 0.2 mol N atoms / 2 = 0.1 mol.\n# This matches moles_gas_C, so Gas C is indeed N2.\n\n# Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the mixture\nmoles_H_total = moles_H2O * 2\nmoles_N_total = moles_gas_C * 2\nmoles_O_total = moles_H2O * 1 + moles_O_atoms\n\n# The molar ratio of elements in the combined formula (A+B) is N:H:O\n# N : H : O  ~=  0.2 : 0.4 : (0.2 + 0.05) = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25\n\n# Step 3: Identify Salts A and B\n# To get an integer ratio, divide by the smallest value (0.2)\n# N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n# Multiply by 4 to get whole numbers\n# N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n# The combined formula for (A+B) is N4H8O5.\n\n# The salts are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n# Two ammonium ions (NH4+) would account for N2H8.\n# Subtracting N2H8 from N4H8O5 leaves N2O5 for the two anions.\n# The two most common nitrogen oxyanions that sum to N2O5 are nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-).\n# So, Salt A is Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3) and Salt B is Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2).\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n# Salt A: NH4NO3 -> N2H4O3\natoms_in_A = 2 + 4 + 3\n# Salt B: NH4NO2 -> N2H4O2\natoms_in_B = 2 + 4 + 2\n\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\n\nprint(f\"The salts are identified as Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3) and Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2).\")\nprint(f\"Number of atoms in NH4NO3: {atoms_in_A}\")\nprint(f\"Number of atoms in NH4NO2: {atoms_in_B}\")\nprint(f\"The total number of all atoms in salts A and B is: {total_atoms}\")\n\n# Step 5: Match to Options\noptions = {'A': 19, 'B': 15, 'C': 13, 'D': 17}\nfinal_choice = None\nfor choice, value in options.items():\n    if value == total_atoms:\n        final_choice = choice\n        break\n\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {final_choice}.\")\n\n# Final Answer Output\nprint(f\"The final answer is {total_atoms}\")\nprint(f\"The correct option is {final_choice}\")\n<<<D>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 80\n    <<<D>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of the decomposition.**\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).

Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur that would form acidic oxides.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The problem states CuO is formed, and the tube's mass increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to oxygen atoms bonding with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas (in which case 0.025 mol of O₂ reacted) or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O (in which case 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted).\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the initial salts.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen must be in the final gas, N₂.

The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass.\n*   Total Mass = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O in CuO) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A gas with a molar mass of ~28 g/mol that is inert under these conditions is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition produced 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.10 mol N₂, and an additional 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms that were captured by the copper.\n\nLet's find the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (moles of O atoms captured by Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n\nTo eliminate the decimal, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nThe problem states the initial substance was an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. This means the combined chemical formula of one unit of A and one unit of B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, they are very likely to be ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions (like NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻). Let's test this hypothesis:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated from the experimental data. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products\nThe experiment is designed to separate and identify the gaseous products from the thermal decomposition of the salt mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur that would form acidic oxides.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen was delivered by an oxidizing gas. The two most likely candidates are oxygen gas (O₂) or nitrous oxide (N₂O). Both possibilities will be considered, but as we will see, they lead to the same conclusion.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other gases are removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Determination of the Elemental Composition\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original salt mixture. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the final gas C (N₂) and potentially in the gas that reacted with copper if it was N₂O.\n    *   If the gas in tube #3 was O₂, then all N is in the final 0.10 mol of N₂. Moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   If the gas in tube #3 was N₂O, it would take 0.05 mol of N₂O to deliver 0.05 mol of O atoms. This reaction (Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂) would produce 0.05 mol of N₂. The final 0.10 mol of N₂ would consist of this 0.05 mol plus another 0.05 mol of N₂ produced directly from the decomposition. In this case, the total N atoms are from N₂O (2 × 0.05) and N₂ (2 × 0.05), which is incorrect. The total N atoms in the products are (N from N₂O) + (N from initial N₂) = (2 * 0.05) + (2 * 0.05) = 0.20 mol. Let's re-evaluate: The final gas C is 0.10 mol N₂. If 0.05 mol N₂O reacted, it produced 0.05 mol N₂. This means the other 0.05 mol of N₂ must have been produced directly. The total N atoms are from the 0.05 mol N₂O (0.10 mol N atoms) and the 0.05 mol N₂ (0.10 mol N atoms). This is also 0.20 mol N atoms.\n    *   In both plausible scenarios, the total amount of nitrogen in the original mixture is **0.20 mol of N atoms**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get a simple integer ratio, divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiply by 4 to clear the fraction:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nThe combined formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts contain N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two common salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Formula: **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Formula: **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g equimolar mixture of salts A and B, then passing the resulting gases through a series of tubes. The changes in the tubes allow us to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This rules out salts containing carbonate or other anions that would produce acidic gases.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have been supplied by O₂ gas or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O. As we will see, either assumption leads to the same conclusion about the initial salts.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂), a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the original salts. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the final 0.10 mol of N₂ (and potentially from N₂O if that was the gas in tube 3, but that N₂ would also end up in the final gas C).\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's verify the total mass from these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThis means that the sum of the chemical formulas of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is N₄H₈O₅. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O and decompose into gases, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts in the equimolar mixture are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4.

Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original salt mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen. Let's verify this by calculating the mass of N and then its molar mass.\n    *   Mass of H atoms = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O atoms = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - (0.40 g + 4.00 g) = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert in this context is nitrogen (N₂). This confirms Gas C is N₂.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture is composed of 0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, and 0.25 mol O. The problem states the mixture is **equimolar**. This means the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must have an elemental ratio of:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiplying the entire ratio by 4 gives the integer ratio:\n**N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two common salts (A and B) composed of N, H, and O that decompose into gases and whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The most common salts fitting this description are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\nThis result corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem provides information about the gaseous products formed when the salt mixture is heated. We can use this information to determine the identity and quantity (in moles) of each product.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = 3.60 g. This is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution tests for acidic gases (like CO₂).\n    *   The weight did not change, which means **no acidic gases** were produced.

We will clarify this in the next steps.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** This gas is inert to the previous reagents.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   At Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial salt mixture. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H atoms are in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O from H₂O) + (moles of O from Tube 3)\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** Nitrogen atoms are in the final gas C (N₂) and potentially in the gas that reacted with copper (if it was N₂O). However, regardless of the specific reactions, the total mass must be conserved.\n    *   Total initial mass = 7.20 g.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture contains 0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, and 0.25 mol O. The problem states the mixture is equimolar. This means the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must have an elemental ratio of:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\n**N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, which strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   Let's test the most common candidates: **ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n*   Formula of NH₄NO₃ is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   Formula of NH₄NO₂ is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4.

Analyze the Products of Decomposition\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the salts do not contain elements like carbon that would form acidic oxides.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO, meaning this mass is the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O. If it was O₂ gas, the moles of O₂ would be 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts\nWe can find the total moles of each element in the original mixture by summing the atoms from the products. Let's assume the products are H₂O, N₂, and O₂.\n\n*   **Mass of H₂O** = 3.60 g\n*   **Mass of O₂** = 0.80 g\n*   **Mass of N₂** = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass of Products** = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass perfectly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming our product identification. The original salts must be composed only of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total moles of each element:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O -> 2 × 0.20 = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol of N₂ -> 2 × 0.10 = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂ -> (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n### 3. Identify Salts A and B\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSo, the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two common salts containing N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The most likely candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nAdding their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts in the equimolar mixture are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1.

This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur that would form acidic oxides.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase here is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted = 0.80 g.\n    *   Using the molar mass of atomic oxygen (≈16.0 g/mol), we find the moles of oxygen atoms:\n        Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O. This step determines the amount of oxygen from the gaseous mixture, regardless of its molecular source.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** This is the gas that did not react in any of the previous tubes.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   Using the molar volume of a gas at STP (22.4 L/mol), we find the moles of Gas C:\n        Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given its inertness and the likely composition of the salts, Gas C is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen must be in the final inert gas (0.10 mol of N₂) and potentially in the gas that reacted with copper if it was N₂O. However, the most direct method is to use the conservation of mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Total mass of mixture = 7.20 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass of H - Mass of O = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\nThe initial mixture contained 0.40 mol H, 0.25 mol O, and 0.20 mol N.\n\n### 3. Identify Salts A and B\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains equal moles of salt A and salt B. Therefore, the combined chemical formula of one unit of A plus one unit of B must have an atomic ratio corresponding to the molar ratio of the elements we found.\n\n*   Molar Ratio: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio, divide by the smallest value (0.20):\n    N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire ratio by 4:\n    N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nThe combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two common salts, likely ammonium salts given the gaseous products, that sum to this formula. Let's test the most common ones: ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n*   **Salt A Candidate (Ammonium Nitrate):** Formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Salt B Candidate (Ammonium Nitrite):** Formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This is the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem provides data from passing the decomposition gases through a series of tubes. We can use this to identify the products and their amounts in moles.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The mass did not change, which means **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing carbonates, sulfites, etc.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) atoms = 0.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of an oxygen atom is 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**. This oxygen was delivered by an oxidizing gas in the mixture.\n\n*   **Final Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts and its inertness, Gas C is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original salt mixture.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles from H₂O) + (moles that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N ends up in the final inert gas, N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass of these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The combined formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B must contain the elements in the ratio we just calculated:\n*   N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get the simplest whole-number ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear fractions:\n*   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N₄ : H₈ : O₅**.\n\nSo, the combined formula of (A + B) is N₄H₈O₅.
