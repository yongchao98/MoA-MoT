This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The two-step process of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for this type of reaction is that an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a **meso** compound.\n    *   *Detailed path:* The *syn*-epoxidation of the *trans*-alkene creates a racemic mixture of the *trans*-epoxide. The subsequent *anti*-opening of either of these enantiomeric epoxides leads to the same single product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, which is a meso compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single, achiral meso compound.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene. This molecule is also achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The same reagents are used, resulting in an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for this case is that an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   *Detailed path:* The *syn*-epoxidation of the *cis*-alkene creates a single *meso*-epoxide. The subsequent *anti*-opening of this achiral epoxide can occur at two different carbons, leading to the formation of two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, in equal amounts.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is crucial:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated.

This corresponds to option C.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis, but some made errors in selecting the final option letter. The consistent and correct conclusion from the chemical principles is 2 peaks (standard) and 3 peaks (chiral).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction involves two steps:\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This performs a *syn*-epoxidation. A *trans*-alkene yields a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, this step produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism is an Sₙ2-like backside attack by water, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl groups relative to the original double bond.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall transformation is an *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *trans*-alkene. The stereochemical rule for this is that a *trans*-alkene undergoing an *anti*-addition yields a *meso* compound. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, a single, achiral meso compound.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** The same two-step process results in an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene is that it produces a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   The initial *syn*-epoxidation of the *cis*-alkene produces a single *meso*-epoxide.\n    *   The subsequent *anti*-attack by water on this achiral meso-epoxide can occur at either of the two carbons of the epoxide ring with equal probability, leading to a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. The racemic pair ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair and will appear as a **second peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the racemic mixture into its two components. The (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol will appear as **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as a **third peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.

This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the stereochemical outcome of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, a *trans*-alkene. This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process: 1) epoxidation with mCPBA, followed by 2) acid-catalyzed ring-opening with H₂O. This sequence is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Principle:** The *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl groups to a *trans*-alkene results in the formation of a *meso* compound.\n*   **Mechanism Verification:**\n    1.  The *syn*-epoxidation of the *trans*-alkene produces a racemic mixture of the *trans*-epoxide ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    2.  The subsequent *anti*-attack by water on either of these enantiomers leads to the same single product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This product has two stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal center of symmetry, making it a meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the stereochemical outcome of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene. This molecule is also achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The same reagents are used, resulting in an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Principle:** The *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl groups to a *cis*-alkene results in the formation of a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n*   **Mechanism Verification:**\n    1.  The *syn*-epoxidation of the *cis*-alkene produces the *cis*-epoxide, which is itself a meso compound ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    2.  The subsequent *anti*-attack by water on this achiral meso epoxide can occur at either of the two carbons of the epoxide ring. Attack at one carbon yields (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, while attack at the other yields (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 1:1 racemic mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are crucial:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the chromatographic results**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. The racemic pair will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso compound will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the racemic mixture into its two separate enantiomers, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S), resulting in two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will separate all three stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction involves two steps:\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This performs a *syn*-epoxidation. A *trans*-alkene yields a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, this step produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism is an Sₙ2-like backside attack by water, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl groups relative to the original double bond.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall transformation is an *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *trans*-alkene. The stereochemical rule for this is that a *trans*-alkene undergoing an *anti*-addition yields a *meso* compound. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, a single, achiral meso compound.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** The same two-step process results in an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene is that it produces a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   The initial *syn*-epoxidation of the *cis*-alkene produces a single *meso*-epoxide.\n    *   The subsequent *anti*-attack by water on this achiral meso-epoxide can occur at either of the two carbons of the epoxide ring with equal probability, leading to a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. The racemic pair ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair and will appear as a **second peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the racemic mixture into its two components. The (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol will appear as **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as a **third peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.

The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are crucial:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the chromatographic results**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. The racemic pair will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso compound will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the racemic mixture into its two separate enantiomers, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S), resulting in two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will separate all three stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",
