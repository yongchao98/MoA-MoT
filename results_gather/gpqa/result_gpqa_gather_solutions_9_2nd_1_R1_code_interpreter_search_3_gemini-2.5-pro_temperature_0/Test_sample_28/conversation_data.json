Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, effectively \"knocking out\" the gene's function.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This might alter or destroy protein function, but it could also have little to no effect. It is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids. Similar to a missense mutation, the effect is uncertain.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon. This terminates protein synthesis prematurely. If this occurs early in the gene, it results in a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein. This is a highly effective way to knock out a gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein. This is also a highly effective knockout method.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nFirst, let's establish the baseline by translating the beginning of the intact gene sequence. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid, but the protein is still produced at full length. The functional impact is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This protein will be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val - Thr...\n    *   **Analysis:** This mutant contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single change, it still produces a full-length protein with an uncertain functional outcome.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed, but the rest of the reading frame is intact. The functional impact is uncertain.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe most severe mutation, and therefore the one most likely to eliminate the protein's function, is the **nonsense mutation** found in Mutant 2. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene, guaranteeing that a functional protein cannot be made.\n\nThe question asks for the option corresponding to Mutant 2.\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 1\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 2\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein, which is encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation is the one that is most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene and Protein Synthesis**\nThe process of creating a protein from a gene is called translation, where the DNA sequence is read in groups of three nucleotides called codons. The process begins at the `ATG` start codon.\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT`...-3’\n*   **Translation into Amino Acids:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - This is the start signal.\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n*   **Resulting Protein Start:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly... This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Impact of Each Mutation**\nWe must compare the different types of mutations and their likely effects on protein function.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid. May or may not inactivate the protein.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon. This halts protein synthesis. If it occurs early in the gene, it produces a severely truncated protein that is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n*   **In-frame Deletion:** Deletes one or more full codons (multiples of 3 bases). This removes amino acids but keeps the rest of the sequence in the correct reading frame. It may or may not inactivate the protein.\n\nLet's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is a stop codon. Translation will stop after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe) instead of a full protein. This is virtually certain to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This mutant contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   **Effect:** While two amino acid changes are more disruptive than one, the protein is still produced at full length, and loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This mutant has a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the codon `GGT` for Glycine is removed).\n    *   **Effect:** The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe hierarchy of mutation severity for knocking out a gene is generally: Nonsense/Frameshift > In-frame Deletion/Insertion > Missense.\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene. This is the most severe and direct disruption, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be produced. Therefore, it is the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The correct option is A, which corresponds to Mutant 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this task, I will analyze each mutation to determine its effect on the protein produced by the gene. The goal is to find the mutation most likely to result in a non-functional protein, which would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Establish a baseline:** I will first translate the initial part of the intact gene's DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. This represents the functional protein.\n2.  **Analyze each mutant:** I will translate the DNA sequence of each mutant and compare it to the intact version. I will identify the type of mutation (e.g., silent, missense, nonsense, frameshift).\n3.  **Determine the most severe mutation:** A nonsense mutation, which introduces a premature stop codon, is the most likely to completely abolish protein function, especially when it occurs early in the gene. I will look for the mutant with this type of change.\n4.  **Select the final answer:** Based on the analysis, I will identify the mutant that is the most probable candidate and select the corresponding option.\n\nI will use a Python script to perform the translation and display the results clearly.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_gene_mutations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes gene mutations to determine which is most likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Standard DNA codon table ('*' represents a STOP codon)\n    codon_table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M', 'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K', 'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L', 'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q', 'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V', 'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E', 'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S', 'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'*', 'TAG':'*', 'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'*', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n\n    def translate(seq):\n        \"\"\"Translates a DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence.\"\"\"\n        protein = \"\"\n        # Iterate through the sequence in steps of 3 (codons)\n        for i in range(0, len(seq) - (len(seq) % 3), 3):\n            codon = seq[i:i+3]\n            amino_acid = codon_table.get(codon, 'X') # 'X' for unknown codons\n            protein += amino_acid\n            # Stop translation if a stop codon is encountered\n            if amino_acid == '*':\n                break\n        return protein\n\n    # Gene sequences provided in the problem\n    intact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n    mutant_1 = \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\n    mutant_2 = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\n    mutant_3 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n    mutant_4 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n\n    # Analysis\n    print(\"--- Gene Mutation Analysis ---\\n\")\n\n    # Intact Gene\n    print(f\"Intact Gene:        ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...\")\n    print(f\"Translated Protein: {translate(intact_gene)}\")\n    print(\"Analysis: This is the original, functional protein.\\n\")\n\n    # Mutant 1\n    print(f\"Mutant 1:           ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...\")\n    print(f\"Translated Protein: {translate(mutant_1)}\")\n    print(\"Analysis: Missense mutation (Leucine -> Tyrosine).

This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by a specific gene. Therefore, the most effective way to achieve this goal is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein. This is often called a \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Likely Effects**\nTo evaluate the mutants, we need to understand the impact of different types of mutations on protein synthesis:\n*   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA that does not alter the amino acid sequence. It has no effect on the protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** A change that substitutes one amino acid for another. This *might* disrupt protein function, but it could also have little or no effect. The outcome is uncertain.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change that converts a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon. This causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely, creating a truncated protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides that is a multiple of three. This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is often less severe than a frameshift or nonsense mutation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nWe will translate the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence by reading it in codons (groups of three nucleotides) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly...\n    *   Analysis: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid change. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   Analysis: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The resulting protein will be severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val - Thr...\n    *   Analysis: This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the loss of function is not as certain as with a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The protein will be one amino acid shorter and have another substituted. This is a significant change, but less likely to cause a complete knockout than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude and Select the Best Option**\nThe most severe mutation among the choices is the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2. It introduces a stop codon at the third position, guaranteeing the production of a tiny, non-functional protein fragment. This is the most reliable way to \"knock out\" the gene's function and eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe question asks which mutation will *most probably* achieve the goal. The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 provides the highest probability of success.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 1\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 4\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, a process often called a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Likely Effects**\nTo understand which mutation is most effective, we need to consider their impact on protein synthesis:\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it might have no effect, alter the protein's function, or inactivate it, but it's not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids. Similar to a missense mutation, the effect is not always predictable.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon. This terminates protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost certain to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This alters the entire reading frame downstream, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a premature stop codon.\n\nNonsense and frameshift mutations are the most reliable for creating a non-functional protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Specific Mutations**\n\nFirst, let's establish the beginning of the protein sequence from the intact gene. The sequence is read in three-base codons starting from `ATG`.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n*   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n    *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause protein synthesis to stop after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) changes to `GTC` (Valine). This produces a full-length protein with two altered amino acids. The effect is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another one changed. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe most severe and predictable mutation is the nonsense mutation found in **Mutant 2**. By introducing a stop codon at the very beginning of the gene, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 1\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 4\nD) Mutant 3\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Objective**\nThe goal is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that \"knocks out\" the gene, preventing it from producing a functional protein.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Effects**\nDifferent types of mutations have different levels of impact on the final protein product. In terms of causing a complete loss of function, the hierarchy is generally as follows:\n*   **Most Severe:** Nonsense mutations (creating a premature stop codon) and frameshift mutations (insertions/deletions of bases not in a multiple of three). These mutations drastically alter the protein, usually resulting in a severely truncated or completely scrambled and non-functional product.\n*   **Less Severe:** Missense mutations (changing one amino acid for another) and in-frame deletions/insertions (removing or adding one or more complete amino acids). These mutations can certainly inactivate a protein, but their effect is less predictable. The protein might still be produced and retain partial or even full function.\n*   **No Effect:** Silent mutations (a change in the DNA that does not change the resulting amino acid).\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe analysis begins by breaking the DNA sequence into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will be terminated after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This severely truncated product is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene reveals a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed) combined with a missense mutation. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe type of mutation among the choices. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional fragment of the protein is synthesized. This is the most probable and effective way to eliminate the function of the gene and, consequently, the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Objective**\nThe goal is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by a specific gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a non-functional protein, a process often called a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene and Protein Synthesis**\nThe provided gene sequence begins with `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCT...-3’`. Protein synthesis starts at the `ATG` codon, which sets the reading frame. The DNA is read in three-base units called codons.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Codons:** `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n*   **Translated Amino Acids:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - Start\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n*   The resulting protein starts with the sequence Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly... and is functional, producing the unwanted compound.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Severity of Different Mutation Types**\nTo guarantee a non-functional protein, the mutation should be as disruptive as possible. Here's a general hierarchy of mutation severity:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon. This halts protein synthesis, creating a truncated and almost always non-functional protein. This is a highly effective knockout strategy.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is variable; it might have no effect, or it might inactivate the protein, but it is not guaranteed.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n\n**4. Analyze Each Mutant**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   **Codons:** `ATG TTC TAC`\n    *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Tyrosine\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This might not be enough to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   **Codons:** `ATG TTC TAA`\n    *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - STOP\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`, which is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide, which is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   **Codons:** `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val...\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations** compared to the original (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than one change, it still produces a full-length protein with an uncertain functional outcome.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing the mutant (`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`) to the intact gene (`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT`), we can see two changes: a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed), which removes one amino acid (Glycine) and substitutes another (Leucine to Tyrosine). This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe most effective mutation for eliminating the protein's function is the nonsense mutation found in Mutant 2. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must identify the mutation that will most reliably result in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein cannot synthesize the compound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** First, we establish the baseline by translating the beginning of the original gene sequence into its amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    This sequence produces the functional protein responsible for the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Types of Mutations:** The most effective mutations for \"knocking out\" a gene's function are those that cause the most severe disruption.\n    *   A **nonsense mutation** changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n    *   A **frameshift mutation** (an insertion or deletion of bases not divisible by three) alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   A **missense mutation** changes one amino acid to another. This may or may not disable the protein.\n    *   An **in-frame deletion/insertion** removes or adds one or more complete codons. This alters the protein but is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Mutant:**\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   This sequence changes the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution, which may or may not inactivate it.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   This sequence changes the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n        *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The resulting protein will be severely truncated (only two amino acids long) and will be non-functional. This is a highly effective way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n        *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations**, changing Leucine to Tyrosine and Threonine to Valine. While more disruptive than a single change, it still produces a full-length protein whose function is not guaranteed to be eliminated.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   This sequence contains a **missense mutation** (Leucine to Tyrosine) and an **in-frame deletion** (the codon `GGT` for Glycine is removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most severe and predictable mutation is the nonsense mutation found in Mutant 2. By introducing a stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, it ensures that a functional protein is not produced. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that \"knocks out\" the gene, meaning it prevents the production of a functional protein.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nTo understand which mutation is most effective, we need to consider the different types of point mutations and their likely impact on the final protein:\n*   **Silent Mutation:** A change in a DNA codon that does not change the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** A change that results in a different amino acid being incorporated. This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have little to no effect. The outcome is uncertain.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change that converts an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely, resulting in a truncated protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-Frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides that is a multiple of three. This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is similar to a missense mutation—it might disrupt function, but it's not guaranteed.\n\nThe most severe and reliable knockout mutations are nonsense and frameshift mutations.\n\n**3. Analyze the Gene Sequences**\nThe reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon. Let's break down the intact gene and each mutant into codons.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAA`, which is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will halt protein synthesis after the second amino acid. The resulting two-amino-acid peptide will be non-functional. This is a highly effective knockout mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val - Thr...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than one, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to eliminate function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon (Glycine) has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe of the options provided. It introduces a premature stop codon at the third position, ensuring that only a tiny, non-functional peptide is produced. This is the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct option is the one corresponding to Mutant 2.\nA) Mutant 3\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 4\nD) Mutant 1\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that prevents the synthesis of a functional protein. This is often called a \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Severity**\nTo knock out a gene's function, the most effective mutations are those that cause the most severe disruption to the protein. In descending order of typical severity:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated and almost always non-functional protein. The earlier the stop codon appears, the more severe the effect.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of three nucleotides). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable and may or may not eliminate function.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is highly variable, ranging from no change in function to complete loss of function, depending on the importance of that amino acid.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** Changes a nucleotide but does not change the resulting amino acid. It has no effect on the protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nFirst, let's establish the baseline by translating the start of the intact gene. The reading frame starts with `ATG`.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Changes: `TTT` -> `TTC` (Phe -> Phe, silent) and `CTC` -> `TAC` (Leu -> Tyr, missense).\n    *   Effect: A **missense mutation**. This results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Changes: `TTT` -> `TTC` (silent) and `CTC` -> `TAA`.\n    *   Effect: `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid (Phe). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide, which will be non-functional. This is a highly effective knockout.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   Changes: `CTC` -> `TAC` (Leu -> Tyr) and `ACT` -> `GTC` (Thr -> Val).\n    *   Effect: Two **missense mutations**. This results in a full-length protein with two amino acids changed. While more disruptive than one change, it is less certain to eliminate function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   Changes: Comparing to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon (Gly) has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon (Leu) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyr).\n    *   Effect: An **in-frame deletion** (of 3 bases) plus a **missense mutation**. The protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed. The reading frame is preserved. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and most likely to result in a complete loss of protein function. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional peptide is produced. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound among the given choices.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 1\nB) Mutant 4\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 2\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein, which is encoded by a specific gene. To stop the compound from being made, we need to introduce a mutation that renders the protein non-functional. This is often called a \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nThe most effective mutations for inactivating a protein are those that cause the most severe disruption to its structure. The hierarchy of severity is generally as follows:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated and almost always non-functional protein. This is a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of three nucleotides). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. This can be disruptive but is less certain to inactivate the protein than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is variable; it might have no effect, or it might inactivate the protein if the change occurs in a critical functional area.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Gene Sequences**\nWe need to translate the DNA sequence of the intact gene and each mutant into an amino acid sequence to see the effect. The sequence is read in three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein we want to inactivate.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed, which may or may not be functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`, which is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that will be non-functional. This is the most likely candidate to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val - Thr...\n    *   **Analysis:** This mutant contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein whose function is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is missing one amino acid and has another one changed. This is disruptive, but less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe of the options. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most reliable way to achieve the goal of eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe question asks to choose the option corresponding to the correct mutant.\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 1\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 2\n\nSince Mutant 2 is the correct choice, the corresponding option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a non-functional protein, a process often called a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nNot all mutations have the same effect. In terms of causing a complete loss of protein function, the general hierarchy from most severe to least severe is:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon. This truncates the protein, and if it occurs early in the gene, it almost guarantees a non-functional product.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream amino acid sequence and usually leads to a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids, which can be very disruptive but is less certain to be a knockout than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from none to complete loss of function, depending on the role of that specific amino acid.\n5.  **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe analysis involves breaking the DNA sequence into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and translating them into amino acids.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be eliminated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **missense mutation** (`CTC` for Leucine changes to `TAC` for Tyrosine). It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to knock out the gene.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`, which is a **stop codon**. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that will be non-functional. This is the most effective and probable way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than one, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to cause a knockout than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The reading frame is preserved, but the protein is altered. This is less certain to be a knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This is the most severe type of mutation among the choices and is the most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 1\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 4\nD) Mutant 3\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective approach is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, a process often called a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nTo evaluate the mutants, it's crucial to understand the different types of mutations and their likely impact on protein function:\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This may or may not affect the protein's function, depending on the importance of that specific amino acid to the protein's structure. It is not a guaranteed way to eliminate function.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete codons (multiples of three nucleotides). This results in a protein missing or gaining amino acids. Like a missense mutation, this might alter function but doesn't guarantee a complete loss.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a codon that codes for an amino acid into a \"stop\" codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely, resulting in a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost certain to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This alters the three-base reading frame, scrambling the entire amino acid sequence from the point of the mutation onward. This also typically results in a non-functional protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe genetic code is read in triplets (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the original, functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **missense mutation** (`CTC` for Leucine is changed to `TAC` for Tyrosine). It changes one amino acid. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The third codon (`CTC` for Leucine) is changed to `TAA`, which is a stop codon. This will halt protein synthesis, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val** - Thr...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (Leucine to Tyrosine and Threonine to Valine). While more disruptive than one change, it is still less certain to eliminate function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is altered but not as severely as in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe hierarchy of mutation severity for knocking out a gene is generally: Nonsense/Frameshift > In-frame Deletion > Missense.\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein sequence. This is the most severe and predictable disruption among the choices, making it the most probable mutation to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct option is D, which corresponds to Mutant 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to select the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a non-functional or completely absent protein, a so-called \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene and Types of Mutations**\nThe intact gene sequence begins `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`. Protein synthesis starts at the `ATG` codon.\n*   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n*   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n*   `CTC` -> Leucine\n*   `GCT` -> Alanine\n\nThe most effective mutations for knocking out gene function are those that cause the most severe disruption. In order of severity, these are generally:\n*   **Nonsense mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon, truncating the protein. This is highly effective, especially if it occurs early in the gene.\n*   **Frameshift mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three, which scrambles the entire downstream amino acid sequence.\n*   **Missense mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is variable and may or may not inactivate the protein.\n*   **Silent mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. This has no effect.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Mutant**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This might not be enough to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n    *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause protein synthesis to terminate after the second amino acid. The resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein with an uncertain functional outcome.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the `GGT` codon for Glycine is removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the third position in the coding sequence. This is a nonsense mutation that will lead to a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most direct and reliable method among the choices for eliminating the protein's function and, consequently, the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct option is B, which corresponds to Mutant 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that is most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a non-functional protein, a process often called a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Impact**\nTo understand which mutation is most severe, we must consider their effects on protein synthesis:\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have little to no effect. It is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete codons (multiples of 3 DNA bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. Like a missense mutation, the impact is uncertain.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This causes protein synthesis to halt prematurely, creating a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost certain to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all amino acids downstream from the mutation and usually leading to a premature stop codon.\n\nA nonsense or frameshift mutation early in the gene sequence is the most reliable way to ensure a non-functional protein.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Mutant Sequence**\n\nFirst, let's establish the beginning of the protein sequence from the **Intact Gene**:\n*   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n*   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\nNow, let's examine the mutants:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n    *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide, which will be non-functional. This is the most effective and probable way to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine). This results in a full-length protein with two altered amino acids. The impact is still less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   This sequence has a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the `GGT` codon for Glycine is removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another one changed. While disruptive, it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the third position of the gene. This is a nonsense mutation that will halt protein synthesis, resulting in a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most definitive and probable way among the choices to eliminate the function of the gene and, consequently, the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe question asks to choose from the options:\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 1\n\nBased on the analysis, Mutant 2 is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, effectively \"knocking out\" the gene's function.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This might alter or destroy protein function, but it could also have little to no effect. It is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids. Similar to a missense mutation, the effect is uncertain.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon. This terminates protein synthesis prematurely. If this occurs early in the gene, it results in a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein. This is a highly effective way to knock out a gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein. This is also a highly effective knockout method.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nFirst, let's establish the baseline by translating the beginning of the intact gene sequence. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid, but the protein is still produced at full length. The functional impact is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This protein will be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val - Thr...\n    *   **Analysis:** This mutant contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single change, it still produces a full-length protein with an uncertain functional outcome.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed, but the rest of the reading frame is intact. The functional impact is uncertain.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe most severe mutation, and therefore the one most likely to eliminate the protein's function, is the **nonsense mutation** found in Mutant 2. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene, guaranteeing that a functional protein cannot be made.\n\nThe question asks for the option corresponding to Mutant 2.\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 1\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 2\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein, which is encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation is the one that is most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene and Protein Synthesis**\nThe process of creating a protein from a gene is called translation, where the DNA sequence is read in groups of three nucleotides called codons. The process begins at the `ATG` start codon.\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT`...-3’\n*   **Translation into Amino Acids:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - This is the start signal.\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n*   **Resulting Protein Start:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly... This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Impact of Each Mutation**\nWe must compare the different types of mutations and their likely effects on protein function.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid. May or may not inactivate the protein.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon. This halts protein synthesis. If it occurs early in the gene, it produces a severely truncated protein that is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n*   **In-frame Deletion:** Deletes one or more full codons (multiples of 3 bases). This removes amino acids but keeps the rest of the sequence in the correct reading frame. It may or may not inactivate the protein.\n\nLet's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is a stop codon. Translation will stop after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe) instead of a full protein. This is virtually certain to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This mutant contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   **Effect:** While two amino acid changes are more disruptive than one, the protein is still produced at full length, and loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This mutant has a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the codon `GGT` for Glycine is removed).\n    *   **Effect:** The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe hierarchy of mutation severity for knocking out a gene is generally: Nonsense/Frameshift > In-frame Deletion/Insertion > Missense.\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene. This is the most severe and direct disruption, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be produced. Therefore, it is the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The correct option is A, which corresponds to Mutant 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this task, I will analyze each mutation to determine its effect on the protein produced by the gene. The goal is to find the mutation most likely to result in a non-functional protein, which would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Establish a baseline:** I will first translate the initial part of the intact gene's DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. This represents the functional protein.\n2.  **Analyze each mutant:** I will translate the DNA sequence of each mutant and compare it to the intact version. I will identify the type of mutation (e.g., silent, missense, nonsense, frameshift).\n3.  **Determine the most severe mutation:** A nonsense mutation, which introduces a premature stop codon, is the most likely to completely abolish protein function, especially when it occurs early in the gene. I will look for the mutant with this type of change.\n4.  **Select the final answer:** Based on the analysis, I will identify the mutant that is the most probable candidate and select the corresponding option.\n\nI will use a Python script to perform the translation and display the results clearly.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_gene_mutations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes gene mutations to determine which is most likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Standard DNA codon table ('*' represents a STOP codon)\n    codon_table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M', 'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K', 'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L', 'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q', 'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V', 'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E', 'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S', 'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'*', 'TAG':'*', 'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'*', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n\n    def translate(seq):\n        \"\"\"Translates a DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence.\"\"\"\n        protein = \"\"\n        # Iterate through the sequence in steps of 3 (codons)\n        for i in range(0, len(seq) - (len(seq) % 3), 3):\n            codon = seq[i:i+3]\n            amino_acid = codon_table.get(codon, 'X') # 'X' for unknown codons\n            protein += amino_acid\n            # Stop translation if a stop codon is encountered\n            if amino_acid == '*':\n                break\n        return protein\n\n    # Gene sequences provided in the problem\n    intact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n    mutant_1 = \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\n    mutant_2 = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\n    mutant_3 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n    mutant_4 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n\n    # Analysis\n    print(\"--- Gene Mutation Analysis ---\\n\")\n\n    # Intact Gene\n    print(f\"Intact Gene:        ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...\")\n    print(f\"Translated Protein: {translate(intact_gene)}\")\n    print(\"Analysis: This is the original, functional protein.\\n\")\n\n    # Mutant 1\n    print(f\"Mutant 1:           ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...\")\n    print(f\"Translated Protein: {translate(mutant_1)}\")\n    print(\"Analysis: Missense mutation (Leucine -> Tyrosine).

This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by a specific gene. Therefore, the most effective way to achieve this goal is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein. This is often called a \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Likely Effects**\nTo evaluate the mutants, we need to understand the impact of different types of mutations on protein synthesis:\n*   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA that does not alter the amino acid sequence. It has no effect on the protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** A change that substitutes one amino acid for another. This *might* disrupt protein function, but it could also have little or no effect. The outcome is uncertain.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change that converts a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon. This causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely, creating a truncated protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides that is a multiple of three. This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is often less severe than a frameshift or nonsense mutation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nWe will translate the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence by reading it in codons (groups of three nucleotides) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly...\n    *   Analysis: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid change. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   Analysis: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The resulting protein will be severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val - Thr...\n    *   Analysis: This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the loss of function is not as certain as with a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The protein will be one amino acid shorter and have another substituted. This is a significant change, but less likely to cause a complete knockout than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude and Select the Best Option**\nThe most severe mutation among the choices is the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2. It introduces a stop codon at the third position, guaranteeing the production of a tiny, non-functional protein fragment. This is the most reliable way to \"knock out\" the gene's function and eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe question asks which mutation will *most probably* achieve the goal. The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 provides the highest probability of success.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 1\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 4\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, a process often called a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Likely Effects**\nTo understand which mutation is most effective, we need to consider their impact on protein synthesis:\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it might have no effect, alter the protein's function, or inactivate it, but it's not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids. Similar to a missense mutation, the effect is not always predictable.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon. This terminates protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost certain to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This alters the entire reading frame downstream, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a premature stop codon.\n\nNonsense and frameshift mutations are the most reliable for creating a non-functional protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Specific Mutations**\n\nFirst, let's establish the beginning of the protein sequence from the intact gene. The sequence is read in three-base codons starting from `ATG`.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n*   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n    *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause protein synthesis to stop after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) changes to `GTC` (Valine). This produces a full-length protein with two altered amino acids. The effect is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another one changed. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe most severe and predictable mutation is the nonsense mutation found in **Mutant 2**. By introducing a stop codon at the very beginning of the gene, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 1\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 4\nD) Mutant 3\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Objective**\nThe goal is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that \"knocks out\" the gene, preventing it from producing a functional protein.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Effects**\nDifferent types of mutations have different levels of impact on the final protein product. In terms of causing a complete loss of function, the hierarchy is generally as follows:\n*   **Most Severe:** Nonsense mutations (creating a premature stop codon) and frameshift mutations (insertions/deletions of bases not in a multiple of three). These mutations drastically alter the protein, usually resulting in a severely truncated or completely scrambled and non-functional product.\n*   **Less Severe:** Missense mutations (changing one amino acid for another) and in-frame deletions/insertions (removing or adding one or more complete amino acids). These mutations can certainly inactivate a protein, but their effect is less predictable. The protein might still be produced and retain partial or even full function.\n*   **No Effect:** Silent mutations (a change in the DNA that does not change the resulting amino acid).\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe analysis begins by breaking the DNA sequence into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will be terminated after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This severely truncated product is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene reveals a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed) combined with a missense mutation. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe type of mutation among the choices. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional fragment of the protein is synthesized. This is the most probable and effective way to eliminate the function of the gene and, consequently, the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Objective**\nThe goal is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by a specific gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a non-functional protein, a process often called a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene and Protein Synthesis**\nThe provided gene sequence begins with `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCT...-3’`. Protein synthesis starts at the `ATG` codon, which sets the reading frame. The DNA is read in three-base units called codons.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Codons:** `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n*   **Translated Amino Acids:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - Start\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n*   The resulting protein starts with the sequence Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly... and is functional, producing the unwanted compound.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Severity of Different Mutation Types**\nTo guarantee a non-functional protein, the mutation should be as disruptive as possible. Here's a general hierarchy of mutation severity:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon. This halts protein synthesis, creating a truncated and almost always non-functional protein. This is a highly effective knockout strategy.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is variable; it might have no effect, or it might inactivate the protein, but it is not guaranteed.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n\n**4. Analyze Each Mutant**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   **Codons:** `ATG TTC TAC`\n    *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Tyrosine\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This might not be enough to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   **Codons:** `ATG TTC TAA`\n    *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - STOP\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`, which is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide, which is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   **Codons:** `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val...\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations** compared to the original (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than one change, it still produces a full-length protein with an uncertain functional outcome.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing the mutant (`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`) to the intact gene (`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT`), we can see two changes: a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed), which removes one amino acid (Glycine) and substitutes another (Leucine to Tyrosine). This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe most effective mutation for eliminating the protein's function is the nonsense mutation found in Mutant 2. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must identify the mutation that will most reliably result in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein cannot synthesize the compound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** First, we establish the baseline by translating the beginning of the original gene sequence into its amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    This sequence produces the functional protein responsible for the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Types of Mutations:** The most effective mutations for \"knocking out\" a gene's function are those that cause the most severe disruption.\n    *   A **nonsense mutation** changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n    *   A **frameshift mutation** (an insertion or deletion of bases not divisible by three) alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   A **missense mutation** changes one amino acid to another. This may or may not disable the protein.\n    *   An **in-frame deletion/insertion** removes or adds one or more complete codons. This alters the protein but is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Mutant:**\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   This sequence changes the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution, which may or may not inactivate it.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   This sequence changes the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n        *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The resulting protein will be severely truncated (only two amino acids long) and will be non-functional. This is a highly effective way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n        *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations**, changing Leucine to Tyrosine and Threonine to Valine. While more disruptive than a single change, it still produces a full-length protein whose function is not guaranteed to be eliminated.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   This sequence contains a **missense mutation** (Leucine to Tyrosine) and an **in-frame deletion** (the codon `GGT` for Glycine is removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most severe and predictable mutation is the nonsense mutation found in Mutant 2. By introducing a stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, it ensures that a functional protein is not produced. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that \"knocks out\" the gene, meaning it prevents the production of a functional protein.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nTo understand which mutation is most effective, we need to consider the different types of point mutations and their likely impact on the final protein:\n*   **Silent Mutation:** A change in a DNA codon that does not change the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** A change that results in a different amino acid being incorporated. This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have little to no effect. The outcome is uncertain.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change that converts an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely, resulting in a truncated protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-Frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides that is a multiple of three. This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is similar to a missense mutation—it might disrupt function, but it's not guaranteed.\n\nThe most severe and reliable knockout mutations are nonsense and frameshift mutations.\n\n**3. Analyze the Gene Sequences**\nThe reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon. Let's break down the intact gene and each mutant into codons.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAA`, which is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will halt protein synthesis after the second amino acid. The resulting two-amino-acid peptide will be non-functional. This is a highly effective knockout mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val - Thr...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than one, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to eliminate function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon (Glycine) has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe of the options provided. It introduces a premature stop codon at the third position, ensuring that only a tiny, non-functional peptide is produced. This is the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct option is the one corresponding to Mutant 2.\nA) Mutant 3\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 4\nD) Mutant 1\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that prevents the synthesis of a functional protein. This is often called a \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Severity**\nTo knock out a gene's function, the most effective mutations are those that cause the most severe disruption to the protein. In descending order of typical severity:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated and almost always non-functional protein. The earlier the stop codon appears, the more severe the effect.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of three nucleotides). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable and may or may not eliminate function.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is highly variable, ranging from no change in function to complete loss of function, depending on the importance of that amino acid.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** Changes a nucleotide but does not change the resulting amino acid. It has no effect on the protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nFirst, let's establish the baseline by translating the start of the intact gene. The reading frame starts with `ATG`.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Changes: `TTT` -> `TTC` (Phe -> Phe, silent) and `CTC` -> `TAC` (Leu -> Tyr, missense).\n    *   Effect: A **missense mutation**. This results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Changes: `TTT` -> `TTC` (silent) and `CTC` -> `TAA`.\n    *   Effect: `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid (Phe). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide, which will be non-functional. This is a highly effective knockout.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   Changes: `CTC` -> `TAC` (Leu -> Tyr) and `ACT` -> `GTC` (Thr -> Val).\n    *   Effect: Two **missense mutations**. This results in a full-length protein with two amino acids changed. While more disruptive than one change, it is less certain to eliminate function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   Changes: Comparing to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon (Gly) has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon (Leu) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyr).\n    *   Effect: An **in-frame deletion** (of 3 bases) plus a **missense mutation**. The protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed. The reading frame is preserved. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and most likely to result in a complete loss of protein function. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional peptide is produced. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound among the given choices.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 1\nB) Mutant 4\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 2\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein, which is encoded by a specific gene. To stop the compound from being made, we need to introduce a mutation that renders the protein non-functional. This is often called a \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nThe most effective mutations for inactivating a protein are those that cause the most severe disruption to its structure. The hierarchy of severity is generally as follows:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated and almost always non-functional protein. This is a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of three nucleotides). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. This can be disruptive but is less certain to inactivate the protein than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is variable; it might have no effect, or it might inactivate the protein if the change occurs in a critical functional area.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Gene Sequences**\nWe need to translate the DNA sequence of the intact gene and each mutant into an amino acid sequence to see the effect. The sequence is read in three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein we want to inactivate.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed, which may or may not be functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`, which is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that will be non-functional. This is the most likely candidate to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val - Thr...\n    *   **Analysis:** This mutant contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein whose function is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is missing one amino acid and has another one changed. This is disruptive, but less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe of the options. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most reliable way to achieve the goal of eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe question asks to choose the option corresponding to the correct mutant.\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 1\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 2\n\nSince Mutant 2 is the correct choice, the corresponding option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a non-functional protein, a process often called a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nNot all mutations have the same effect. In terms of causing a complete loss of protein function, the general hierarchy from most severe to least severe is:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon. This truncates the protein, and if it occurs early in the gene, it almost guarantees a non-functional product.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream amino acid sequence and usually leads to a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids, which can be very disruptive but is less certain to be a knockout than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from none to complete loss of function, depending on the role of that specific amino acid.\n5.  **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe analysis involves breaking the DNA sequence into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and translating them into amino acids.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be eliminated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **missense mutation** (`CTC` for Leucine changes to `TAC` for Tyrosine). It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to knock out the gene.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`, which is a **stop codon**. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that will be non-functional. This is the most effective and probable way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than one, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to cause a knockout than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The reading frame is preserved, but the protein is altered. This is less certain to be a knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This is the most severe type of mutation among the choices and is the most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 1\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 4\nD) Mutant 3\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective approach is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, a process often called a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\nTo evaluate the mutants, it's crucial to understand the different types of mutations and their likely impact on protein function:\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This may or may not affect the protein's function, depending on the importance of that specific amino acid to the protein's structure. It is not a guaranteed way to eliminate function.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete codons (multiples of three nucleotides). This results in a protein missing or gaining amino acids. Like a missense mutation, this might alter function but doesn't guarantee a complete loss.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a codon that codes for an amino acid into a \"stop\" codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely, resulting in a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost certain to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This alters the three-base reading frame, scrambling the entire amino acid sequence from the point of the mutation onward. This also typically results in a non-functional protein.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nThe genetic code is read in triplets (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the original, functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **missense mutation** (`CTC` for Leucine is changed to `TAC` for Tyrosine). It changes one amino acid. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The third codon (`CTC` for Leucine) is changed to `TAA`, which is a stop codon. This will halt protein synthesis, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val** - Thr...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (Leucine to Tyrosine and Threonine to Valine). While more disruptive than one change, it is still less certain to eliminate function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is altered but not as severely as in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe hierarchy of mutation severity for knocking out a gene is generally: Nonsense/Frameshift > In-frame Deletion > Missense.\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein sequence. This is the most severe and predictable disruption among the choices, making it the most probable mutation to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct option is D, which corresponds to Mutant 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to select the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a non-functional or completely absent protein, a so-called \"knockout\" mutation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene and Types of Mutations**\nThe intact gene sequence begins `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`. Protein synthesis starts at the `ATG` codon.\n*   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n*   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n*   `CTC` -> Leucine\n*   `GCT` -> Alanine\n\nThe most effective mutations for knocking out gene function are those that cause the most severe disruption. In order of severity, these are generally:\n*   **Nonsense mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon, truncating the protein. This is highly effective, especially if it occurs early in the gene.\n*   **Frameshift mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three, which scrambles the entire downstream amino acid sequence.\n*   **Missense mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is variable and may or may not inactivate the protein.\n*   **Silent mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. This has no effect.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Mutant**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This might not be enough to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n    *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause protein synthesis to terminate after the second amino acid. The resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein with an uncertain functional outcome.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the `GGT` codon for Glycine is removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the third position in the coding sequence. This is a nonsense mutation that will lead to a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most direct and reliable method among the choices for eliminating the protein's function and, consequently, the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct option is B, which corresponds to Mutant 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the mutation that is most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a non-functional protein, a process often called a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Impact**\nTo understand which mutation is most severe, we must consider their effects on protein synthesis:\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have little to no effect. It is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete codons (multiples of 3 DNA bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. Like a missense mutation, the impact is uncertain.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This causes protein synthesis to halt prematurely, creating a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost certain to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all amino acids downstream from the mutation and usually leading to a premature stop codon.\n\nA nonsense or frameshift mutation early in the gene sequence is the most reliable way to ensure a non-functional protein.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Mutant Sequence**\n\nFirst, let's establish the beginning of the protein sequence from the **Intact Gene**:\n*   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n*   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\nNow, let's examine the mutants:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n    *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide, which will be non-functional. This is the most effective and probable way to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`...-3’\n    *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine). This results in a full-length protein with two altered amino acids. The impact is still less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`...-3’\n    *   This sequence has a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the `GGT` codon for Glycine is removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another one changed. While disruptive, it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the third position of the gene. This is a nonsense mutation that will halt protein synthesis, resulting in a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most definitive and probable way among the choices to eliminate the function of the gene and, consequently, the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe question asks to choose from the options:\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 1\n\nBased on the analysis, Mutant 2 is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",
