Understanding the Transition Process**\n\nThe problem describes a cascade decay from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s state) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s state) through an intermediate state via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n**2. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\n\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n$, can be any integer.\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n\n**3. First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\nLet's apply the selection rules to the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$:\n*   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since $l=0$, the only possibility is $l' = l+1 = 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since $m=0$, the possible values for $m'$ are $m' = m + \\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n$:** For a decay process (emission of a photon), the energy of the atom must decrease, so the principal quantum number must decrease, i.e., $n' < 3$. The possible values are $n'=2$ or $n'=1$. However, for $n'=1$, the only possible value for $l'$ is $l'=0$. This contradicts the requirement that $l'=1$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n\nCombining these results, the possible intermediate states are:\n$|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. These correspond to the three degenerate $2p$ orbitals.\n\n**4. Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\nNow, let's check if a transition from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   **Intermediate state:** $n'=2, l'=1, m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n*   **Final state:** $n_{f}=1, l_{f}=0, m_{f}=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$.\n    *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$ (allowed).\n    *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$ (allowed).\n    *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = 1$ (allowed).\n\nSo, all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The possible transition routes are:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll routes listed in the options are physically possible. We now need to determine the probability.\n\n**5. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n*   **Step 1: Branching Ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (an s-orbital). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the probability of decaying into any of the three degenerate $2p$ states ($|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$) must be equal. Since these are the only allowed E1 decay channels (we assume decay to higher $p$ states is negligible, which is standard), the total probability of decaying to the $2p$ level is 1. The probability is distributed equally among the three possible final states.\n    \n    Branching Ratio ($BR_1$) for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$ for each $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n\n*   **Step 2: Branching Ratio for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    Once the atom is in one of the $2p$ states (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$), it will decay to a lower energy state. The only state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the $1s$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$). Decay to the $2s$ state is forbidden by the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. Therefore, any atom that reaches a $2p$ state is certain to decay to the $1s$ state.\n    \n    Branching Ratio ($BR_2$) for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability for a specific route**\n    The total probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is:\n    $P = BR_1 \\times BR_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is a valid path, and its probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Let's check this against the given options:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability, should be $\\frac{1}{3}$)\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability, should be $\\frac{1}{3}$)\n\nOnly option B provides a correct combination of a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two dipole transitions is governed by the electric dipole selection rules. These rules dictate how the quantum numbers *n*, *l*, and *m* can change during a transition.\n\n### 1. Dipole Selection Rules\n\nFor an electric dipole transition, the selection rules are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\nThe principal quantum number *n* must decrease for a decay (emission of a photon). The question specifies a two-step transition, implying the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Change in *l***: Since the initial orbital quantum number *l* is 0, the only possible change is $\\Delta l = +1$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Change in *m***: The initial magnetic quantum number *m* is 0. The selection rule allows $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, so the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n*   **Change in *n***: The transition must be to a lower energy level, so $n' < 3$. A decay to the $n'=2$ level is a common pathway.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n*   **Final State:** $|n'',l'',m''\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Change in *l***: The intermediate state has $l'=1$ and the final state has $l''=0$. The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed by the selection rules.\n*   **Change in *m***: The final state has $m''=0$. The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. Since the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, the possible changes are $\\Delta m \\in \\{+1, 0, -1\\}$, all of which are allowed.\n\nAll three potential pathways are valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 4. Transition Probabilities\n\nThe probability of a specific decay path depends on the transition rates, which are proportional to the square of the matrix elements of the electric dipole operator. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, it can be shown that the angular part of the transition probability is determined by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):** The transition rates are found to be equal for all three possible intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n*   **For the second transition ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):** Similarly, the transition rates from each of the three intermediate states to the final ground state are also equal.\n\nSince the probabilities for each of the three possible cascade routes are equal, and they are the only routes for this two-dipole transition process via the n=2 shell, the total probability is distributed evenly among them. Therefore, the probability of any single specific route is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n\nOption A correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe user wants me to solve a quantum mechanics problem about the decay of a hydrogen atom state and provide the answer as Python code.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics:**\n    *   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This is a spherically symmetric state ($l=0$).\n    *   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Process:** Two consecutive electric dipole transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state.\n    *   **Selection Rules:** For a dipole transition, the selection rules are $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n2.  **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ to $l=0$ gives $l'=1$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ to $m=0$ gives $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   The problem options specify the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n    *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ to $l'=1$ allows for a final state with $l_{final}=0$ or $l_{final}=2$. The target state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ has $l_{final}=0$, so this is allowed.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ to $m'$ must result in $m_{final}=0$. This is possible for all three intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   Conclusion: All three routes proposed in options A, B, and C are physically possible.\n\n4.  **Calculate Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    *   The core of the problem is to determine the probability of taking a specific path.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric. When it decays, there is no preferred direction in space.\n    *   This means the emission of the first photon is isotropic, and the atom is left in one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states.\n    *   Because of the initial symmetry, the probability of ending up in any of the possible $m'$ sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) must be equal.\n    *   Since there are three possible, equally likely intermediate states, the total probability is split three ways.\n    *   Therefore, the probability (or branching ratio) for any one of these specific routes is $1/3$.\n\n5.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   Route A: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability should be $1/3$. Option says $1/4$. Incorrect.\n    *   Route B: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability should be $1/3$. Option says $1/3$. **Correct.**\n    *   Route C: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability should be $1/3$. Option says $1/4$. Incorrect.\n    *   Route D: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability should be $1/3$. Option says $2/3$. Incorrect.\n\n6.  **Construct Python Code:**\n    *   The code will formalize the argument that the probabilities are equal by using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which relates the transition probabilities to the square of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n    *   I will use the `sympy.physics.wigner.clebsch_gordan` function to calculate these coefficients for the three possible transitions.\n    *   The code will show that the squared coefficients are equal, confirming the branching ratio is $1/3$ for each path.\n    *   Finally, the code will select and print the correct option based on this result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\ndef solve_hydrogen_decay():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the correct transition route and probability for the H-atom decay\n    from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem describes a two-step decay: |3,0,0> -> |2,1,m'> -> |1,0,0>.\n    # We need to find the probability (branching ratio) for a specific path.\n\n    # The key insight is that the initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (l=0).\n    # Therefore, the decay to the intermediate |2,1,m'> states must be isotropic,\n    # meaning the probability is distributed equally among the possible m' sublevels.\n    # The possible m' values are -1, 0, and 1.

Understand the Process**\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs not in a single step, but via a two-step process involving two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. The overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**2. Apply Dipole Transition Selection Rules**\nFor an electric dipole transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer. Since this is a decay process (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State(s)**\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the transition.\n\n*   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   Initial state: $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta n = n' - n_i = n' - 3 < 0$, so $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **Second transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Final state: $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - l' = \\pm 1$. This requires $l'=1$, which is consistent with the first transition.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This requires $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which is also consistent.\n    *   $\\Delta n = n_f - n' = 1 - n' < 0$, so $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions for the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n    *   From the first step: $n'<3$, $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   From the second step: $n'>1$, $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The only integer value for $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$ is $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\nThis means there are three possible routes for the two-step decay:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This probability is the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the probability that the atom, starting in $|3,0,0\\rangle$, will decay into a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe probability of a transition to a specific state is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle \\text{final} | \\vec{d} | \\text{initial} \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d} = -e\\vec{r}$ is the electric dipole operator. The transition rate is proportional to $|\\langle n',l',m' | \\vec{r} | n,l,m \\rangle|^2$.\n\nWe need to find the relative rates for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states:\n*   Rate to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: $W_{-1} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,-1 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n*   Rate to $|2,1,0\\rangle$: $W_{0} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,0 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n*   Rate to $|2,1,1\\rangle$: $W_{+1} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,1 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has orbital angular momentum $l=0$, which means its wavefunction is spherically symmetric. When a spherically symmetric system decays, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the decay populates each of the magnetic sublevels ($m'$) of the final state equally.\n\nTherefore, the transition rates to the states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equal:\n$W_{-1} = W_{0} = W_{+1}$\n\nThe total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $n=2, l=1$ level is $W_{total} = W_{-1} + W_{0} + W_{+1} = 3W_{0}$.\n\nThe probability (branching ratio) for the atom to take the path through the intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{W_{0}}{W_{total}} = \\frac{W_{0}}{W_{-1} + W_{0} + W_{+1}} = \\frac{W_{0}}{3W_{0}} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSimilarly, the probabilities for the paths through $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are also both $1/3$.\n\nOnce the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it will decay to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Since this is the only allowed decay channel to the $n=1$ level, the probability of this second step is 1. Thus, the probability of the entire cascade is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n**5. Match with the Options**\nWe are looking for an option that lists a valid route and the correct probability.\n*   A) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.

(Correct route and probability)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process and Selection Rules:**\n    The problem describes a two-step cascade decay from the hydrogen atom state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ (change in orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ (change in magnetic quantum number)\n    *   Parity must change, which is guaranteed by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ since parity is given by $(-1)^l$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Possible Transition Routes:**\n    The decay proceeds from the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$ via an intermediate state $|k\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |k\\rangle$):**\n        *   Initial state: $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n        *   Applying selection rules:\n            *   $\\Delta l = +1$ is required, since $l=0$ cannot decrease. So, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n            *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   The problem implies the intermediate state has the principal quantum number $n'=2$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states $|k\\rangle$ are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition ($|k\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n        *   Initial state: $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Final state: $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check if this transition is allowed for all possible intermediate states:\n            *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n            *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. Since $m'$ can be $0, \\pm 1$, this condition is satisfied for all three intermediate states.\n        *   So, all three paths are possible:\n            *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n            *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n            *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Each Route:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is given by the product of the branching ratios for each step.\n    Probability(route) = BranchingRatio(step 1) $\\times$ BranchingRatio(step 2).\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the First Step:**\n        The branching ratio for the transition to a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is the ratio of the partial decay rate to that state to the total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$.\n        The transition rate $\\Gamma_{i \\to k}$ is proportional to the square of the matrix element $|\\langle k | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n        We need to compare the rates $\\Gamma_{300 \\to 21m'}$ for $m' = -1, 0, 1$.\n\n        A powerful symmetry argument can be used here: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means its wavefunction is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay must be isotropic, meaning the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the magnetic sublevels $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n        This implies that the transition rates are equal:\n        $\\Gamma_{300 \\to 21,-1} = \\Gamma_{300 \\to 21,0} = \\Gamma_{300 \\to 21,1}$.\n\n        Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first step, the branching ratio for each is $1/3$.\n        BranchingRatio($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$) = $1/3$ for each $m'$.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the Second Step:**\n        For the second step, the atom is in one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (a $2p$ state). The only lower-energy state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the $1s$ state). Decay to the $|2,0,0\\rangle$ state is also possible in principle, but the energy difference is tiny (Lamb shift), and the $\\omega^3$ dependence of the transition rate makes the decay to $1s$ overwhelmingly dominant. Therefore, we can assume the decay from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state proceeds to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of 1.\n        BranchingRatio($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$) = 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for any of the three specific routes is:\n        Probability(route) = $(1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Let's examine the given options:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect, probability should be 1/3)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct, both the route and the probability match our calculation)\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect, probability is wrong)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect, probability should be 1/3)\n\nThe only option consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Transitions and Selection Rules\n\nThe problem describes a cascade decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through an intermediate state via two electric dipole transitions. The selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $l=0$ and $m=0$.\n*   **Selection rule for $l$:** Since the initial $l=0$, we must have $\\Delta l = +1$, which means the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Selection rule for $m$:** Since the initial $m=0$, we can have $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. This means the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Intermediate state:** The problem implies the intermediate state has a principal quantum number $n'=2$. Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\nLet's check if the transitions from the possible intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ are allowed.\n*   **Initial state:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$. Here, $l'=1$.\n*   **Final state:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Here, the final angular momentum quantum number is $l_{final}=0$.\n*   **Selection rule for $l$:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n*   **Selection rule for $m$:** The change $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$ must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate states ($m' = 0, \\pm 1$).\n\nAll three routes, via $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe overall probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n**Probability of the First Step: $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$**\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. This means there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the first photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate sub-levels of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state. The total probability of transitioning from the 3s state to the 2p manifold is 1 (as it's the only significant decay channel). Therefore, the probability of populating each specific intermediate state is:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n**Probability of the Second Step: $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$**\n\nOnce the atom is in one of the intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (the 2p orbital), it will decay to a lower energy level. According to the dipole selection rules, a transition from $l=1$ can only go to $l=0$ or $l=2$. Since the only available lower energy level is $n=1$, which has $l=0$, the only possible decay channel is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s orbital). Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1, regardless of the value of $m'$.\n$P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$ for $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n**Total Probability of the Cascade Route**\n\nThe total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n$P(\\text{route via } m') = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n\n*   For the route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$: Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$: Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   For the route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### 3. Compare with the Options\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on our findings:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

The probability is incorrect.\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The transition route is valid, and the calculated probability is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state to a final state via two dipole transitions is governed by a set of selection rules. These rules dictate which transitions are possible based on the change in the quantum numbers *n*, *l*, and *m*.\n\nThe process in question is a cascade decay from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state. This cannot happen in a single step because the orbital angular momentum quantum number, *l*, would have to remain 0, which violates the dipole selection rule that requires Δ*l* = ±1. Therefore, the decay must proceed through an intermediate state.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩**\n\n*   **Initial State:** |*n*=3, *l*=0, *m*=0⟩.\n*   **Selection Rules for Dipole Transitions:**\n    *   Δ*l* = *l'* - *l* = ±1. Since the initial *l* is 0, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n    *   Δ*m* = *m'* - *m* = 0, ±1. Since the initial *m* is 0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = 0, +1, or -1.\n*   The principal quantum number *n* must decrease, so *n'* < 3. A common intermediate state is *n'*=2.\n\nBased on these rules, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state to the final state |1,0,0⟩**\n\n*   **Final State:** |*n*=1, *l*=0, *m*=0⟩.\n*   Let's check the transitions from the possible intermediate states:\n    *   From |2,1,*m'*⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.\n    *   Δ*l* = *l*<sub>final</sub> - *l'* = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the selection rule for all possible intermediate states.\n    *   Δ*m* = *m*<sub>final</sub> - *m'* = 0 - *m'*. This must be 0 or ±1. This condition is met for *m'* = 0, +1, and -1.\n\nThus, all three decay routes are physically possible:\n1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (*l*=0). This means there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the first photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the allowed magnetic sublevels (*m'*) of the *l'*=1 state.\n\nThe total transition probability is the sum of the probabilities to each of the three intermediate states: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩. Because of the initial state's symmetry, the probabilities for transitioning to each of these three states are equal.\n\nP(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)\n\nSince these are the only three possible paths for the first step of the cascade, the sum of their probabilities must be 1. Therefore, the probability for any single path is 1/3.\n\nThe question asks for the transition route and its corresponding probability. Let's examine the options provided:\n*   **A) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/3:** This route is valid, and the calculated probability for this specific path is 1/3.\n*   **B) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3:** The probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4:** The probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4:** The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe probability of the entire cascade is determined by the probability of the first step, as the second transition (e.g., from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩) is the only allowed dipole decay path to a lower energy level and thus has a probability of 1. Therefore, the probability of the specific cascade |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is 1/3.\n\nThe correct answer is the one that identifies a valid route with the correct probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe problem asks for a valid decay route and its probability for the transition of a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the selection rules for E1 transitions.\nAn electric dipole transition between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is governed by the following selection rules:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  The principal quantum number $n$ can change by any integer value ($\\Delta n = \\text{any integer}$), but for emission, the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible intermediate states.\nThe process is a two-step cascade:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta n < 0$: The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$. For a cascade to the $n=1$ state, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Final state: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   Let's check if our possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ can decay to the final state.\n*   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: The change is $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: The change is $m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate $m'$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n*   So, all three routes are physically possible:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability of each route.\nThe \"probability\" of a specific route is its branching ratio.\n*   **Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the $2p$ subshell), its only allowed E1 decay channel is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the $1s$ state). Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1 for all three routes.\n*   **First Step:** We need to find the relative probabilities of the transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred direction in space.\n    *   The decay process (spontaneous emission), when averaged over all photon emission directions and polarizations, is an isotropic process.\n    *   The three possible final states for this step, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields) and only differ by their spatial orientation (the value of $m'$).\n    *   Because the initial state and the interaction are both isotropic, there can be no preference for producing one orientation ($m'$) over another. Therefore, the three degenerate $m'$ sub-levels must be populated with equal probability.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since there are three equally likely routes, and the total probability must sum to 1, the probability for each specific route is $1/3$.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the given options.\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid route with the correct corresponding probability is C. The Python code execution confirms that the branching ratio for each of the three possible decay paths is indeed $1/3$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means it's a cascade process involving an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an E1 transition to occur, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First Transition:** From $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l' = 1$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule: $n' < 3$.\n        *   The lowest possible energy level with $l=1$ is $n=2$. So, the most probable first transition is to the $n'=2$ level. The options provided in the question confirm that the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** From the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check if this transition is allowed by the selection rules.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate $m'$ values (i.e., for $m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n        *   $\\Delta n = n_{final} - n' = 1 - 2 = -1$. This is an allowed decay.\n\n4.  **Identify Possible Transition Routes:** Based on the analysis above, there are three possible cascade routes from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) for each Route:**\n    The probability of a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The branching ratio is the ratio of the rate of a specific transition to the total transition rate.\n    The transition rate $\\Gamma_{i \\to f}$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    Let's analyze the rate of the first transition: $\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$.\n\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the three degenerate sub-levels $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equally probable.\n\n    To formally verify this, we can use the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The transition rate from $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle l, m; 1, q | l', m' \\rangle|^2$, where $q = m' - m$.\n    For the first transition: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and $|f\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    So, $l=0, m=0$ and $l'=1, m'=m'$. This gives $q = m' - 0 = m'$.\n    The relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is $\\langle 0, 0; 1, m' | 1, m' \\rangle$. For coupling anything with angular momentum 0, this coefficient is always 1.\n    So, $|\\langle 0, 0; 1, m' | 1, m' \\rangle|^2 = 1$ for all three possible values of $m' (-1, 0, 1)$.\n\n    This confirms that the transition rates are equal:\n    $\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,-1) = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,0) = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,1)$.\n\n    The total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. Since the only allowed E1 decay is to the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the total rate is:\n    $\\Gamma_{total} = \\sum_{m'=-1,0,1} \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$.\n    Let $\\Gamma_0 = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$ for any $m'$. Then $\\Gamma_{total} = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n\n    The probability, or branching ratio, for the transition to proceed via a specific intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n    $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,0)}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    Since the rates are equal for all three intermediate $m'$ states, the probability for each of the three routes is $1/3$.\n\n6.  **Consider the Second Transition's Probability:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, it must decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Are there other competing decay channels from $|2,1,m'\\rangle$?\n    According to the selection rules, a state with $l=1$ can decay to a state with $l=0$ or $l=2$.\n    *   $l=0$: The only state with $l=0$ and $n<2$ is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   $l=2$: States with $l=2$ (d-states) only exist for $n \\ge 3$. Since decay requires $n_{final} < n_{initial}$, there are no allowed E1 transitions from $n=2, l=1$ to an $l=2$ state.\n    Therefore, the state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ can only decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an E1 transition. The probability of this second step, given the atom is in the intermediate state, is 1.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The overall probability of a specific cascade route is the probability of the first step (the branching ratio) multiplied by the probability of the second step.\n    Probability = (Branching Ratio of first step) $\\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\n    So, for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, the probability is $1/3$.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    A) Route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, probability is $\\frac{2}{3}$.

This is the 3s state.\n    *   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is the 1s ground state.\n    *   **Process:** The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means it's a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the correct decay path (the intermediate state) and the probability of that specific path.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions:**\n    For an atom to transition from an initial state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$ to a final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle$ by emitting a single photon (E1 transition), the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For emission (decay), the energy must decrease, which means the principal quantum number must decrease, $n_f < n_i$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Possible Intermediate States:**\n    The decay happens in two steps:\n    *   **Step 1:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$ (Intermediate State)\n    *   **Step 2:** $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ (Final State)\n\n    Let's apply the selection rules to Step 1:\n    *   Initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n    *   **Rule for l:** $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l' = 1$.\n    *   **Rule for m:** $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   **Rule for n:** We need $n' < n_i=3$. Also, for any state, we must have $l' \\le n'-1$. Since we found $l'=1$, we need $1 \\le n'-1$, which implies $n' \\ge 2$. Combining $n'<3$ and $n'\\ge2$, the only possible value is $n'=2$.\n\n    So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    Now, let's check if Step 2 is allowed from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   Initial state for Step 2 is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. Final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Rule for l:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   **Rule for m:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. Since $m'$ can be $-1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$, this condition is satisfied for all three possible intermediate states.\n    *   **Rule for n:** $\\Delta n = n_f - n' = 1 - 2 = -1$. This is an allowed decay.\n\n    Conclusion: All three decay paths are possible:\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first decay step. The total transition rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of the rates to all possible intermediate states. The probability of one specific channel is the rate of that channel divided by the total rate.\n\n    $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m''=-1}^{1} \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m''\\rangle)}$\n\n    We can determine the relative probabilities using a powerful symmetry argument:\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. Its wave function is spherically symmetric, meaning it has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   Because the initial state is rotationally invariant, the decay process itself cannot have a preferred direction.\n    *   Therefore, the atom must decay with equal probability into each of the available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate p-state ($l'=1$).\n\n    This means:\n    $P(\\text{to } m'=-1) = P(\\text{to } m'=0) = P(\\text{to } m'=+1)$\n\n    Since these are the only three possible outcomes for the first transition, their probabilities must sum to 1:\n    $P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1$\n    $3 \\times P(\\text{any single } m') = 1$\n    $P(\\text{any single } m') = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n    So, the probability of the decay proceeding through the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state is $\\frac{1}{3}$. The probability of it proceeding through $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is also $\\frac{1}{3}$, and similarly for $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n5.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   A) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{2}{3}$.

The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe problem asks for the correct decay route and its probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole transitions.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Selection Rules:**\n    Electric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers $|n,l,m\\rangle$:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the First Transition:**\n    The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules for the first transition:\n        *   $l_{initial} = 0$, so we must have $\\Delta l = +1$, which means $l' = 1$.\n        *   $m_{initial} = 0$, so we can have $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, which means $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n        *   $n_{initial} = 3$, so $n'$ must be less than 3. The most probable transitions are to the next lowest principal quantum number, so we consider $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Second Transition:**\n    The final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's check if a transition from our possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state is allowed.\n    *   Applying the selection rules for the second transition:\n        *   $l_{intermediate} = 1$ and $l_{final} = 0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n        *   $m_{final} = 0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n    *   This confirms that all three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The possible decay routes are:\n        *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    We need to find the probability of the specific route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$. The total probability is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio of the First Step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. Consequently, the decay to the three degenerate p-sublevels ($|2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$) must be equally probable.\n        The total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $n=2, l=1$ level is the sum of the rates to the three sub-levels. Since the rates are equal, the probability (or branching ratio) of decaying into any one specific sub-level, such as $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n        So, the branching ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio of the Second Step ($|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n        Once the atom is in the state $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it needs to decay to a lower energy state. The only available lower energy state is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The transition $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed by the dipole selection rules ($\\Delta l = -1, \\Delta m = 0$). Since this is the only possible decay channel, any atom that reaches the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of 1.\n        So, the branching ratio for $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is $1$.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the individual branching ratios:\n        $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The correct transition route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and the corresponding probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state to a lower energy state is governed by quantum mechanical selection rules for dipole transitions. This problem involves a two-step cascade decay from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ ground state.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the First Transition\n\nThe initial state is |n,l,m⟩ = |3,0,0⟩. According to the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n*   The orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* must change by ±1 (Δ*l* = ±1).\n*   The magnetic quantum number *m* can change by 0 or ±1 (Δ*m* = 0, ±1).\n*   The principal quantum number *n* is not strictly constrained but must decrease for a decay.\n\nFor the first transition from |3,0,0⟩:\n*   Since the initial *l* is 0, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n*   Since the initial *m* is 0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = -1, 0, or 1.\n*   The problem specifies a cascade through the n=2 shell, so the intermediate state will have *n'* = 2.\n\nThis means the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Second Transition\n\nThe second transition is from the intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. Let's check if this is allowed by the selection rules:\n*   Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1. This is an allowed change.\n*   For the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩, the change in *m* is Δ*m* = 0 - 0 = 0. This is allowed.\n*   For the intermediate state |2,1,1⟩, the change in *m* is Δ*m* = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n*   For the intermediate state |2,1,-1⟩, the change in *m* is Δ*m* = 0 - (-1) = +1. This is allowed.\n\nTherefore, all three potential pathways are valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the decay.\n\nFor the first step, the atom decays from a spherically symmetric state (*l*=0). In such cases, the transition probabilities to each of the possible *m'* states of the next *l* level are equal. Since there are three possible intermediate states (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩), the probability of transitioning to any single one of them is 1/3.\n\nFor the second step, consider the decay from the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩. The atom must decay to a lower energy level, which is the n=1 ground state. The only possible state in the n=1 shell is |1,0,0⟩ (since *l* must be less than *n*). Therefore, the transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ occurs with a probability of 1, as it is the only available decay channel.\n\nThe total probability for the cascade |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n*   P(total) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\n*   P(total) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\nThis matches the path and probability given in option A. The other options list either incorrect probabilities for their respective valid paths or an incorrect probability for the path in option A.\n\nThe correct transition route and probability are:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state occurs via a two-step electric dipole transition, which necessitates passing through an intermediate state. The rules governing these transitions, known as selection rules, dictate how the quantum numbers n, l, and m can change.\n\n### Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state\n\nThe initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩, commonly known as the 3s state. According to the electric dipole selection rules, for a transition to be allowed, the orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* must change by ±1 (Δl = ±1), and the magnetic quantum number *m* can change by 0 or ±1 (Δm = 0, ±1).\n\nApplying these rules to the initial state |3,0,0⟩:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: Since the initial *l* is 0, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: Since the initial *m* is 0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = 0, 1, or -1.\n\nThe principal quantum number *n* must decrease for a decay. The options provided suggest an intermediate state with n=2. Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩. These correspond to the 2p subshell.\n\n### Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩\n\nAll three possible intermediate states |2,1,m'⟩ can transition to the final state |1,0,0⟩, as this step also satisfies the selection rules (Δl = 0-1 = -1, and Δm is 0 or ±1).\n\n### Calculating the Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This corresponds to the branching ratio for the first step of the decay. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (since *l*=0). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the transitions to each of the possible intermediate states |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩ are equally probable.\n\nSince there are three equally likely decay channels from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the n=2, l=1 manifold, and these are the only allowed dipole transitions to the n=2 shell, the probability for each channel is 1/3.\n\nThe probability of the entire cascade is determined by this first step, as the subsequent decay from any |2,1,m'⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩ is the only path available and thus has a probability of 1.\n\nTherefore, the three possible decay routes and their probabilities are:\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/3 (Correct route and probability)\n*   C) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3 (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct choice is the one that presents a valid route with the calculated probability of 1/3.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ is governed by the electric dipole selection rules:\n$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\nThe problem describes a two-step dipole transition from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.

For this to be allowed, $m'$ must be $0, +1,$ or $-1$, which is true for all possible intermediate states.\n\nAll three routes, via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n**Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe probability of a specific decay route is the product of the branching ratios for each step.\n\n1.  **Branching Ratio for the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (an s-orbital). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to transition to any of the allowed magnetic sublevels of the $l'=1$ state. The three possible final states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. The total probability of transitioning to one of these three states is 1 (assuming the $3s \\rightarrow 2p$ transition is the only one considered). Since the probabilities are equal, the branching ratio for transitioning to any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    So, $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n2.  **Branching Ratio for the second step ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    The intermediate state is a $2p$ state. The only state with a lower principal quantum number that it can decay to via a dipole transition is the $1s$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$). Since this is the only possible decay channel for the $2p$ state, the branching ratio for this transition is 1, regardless of the value of $m'$.\n    So, $P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n**Total Probability for the Cascade**\n\nThe total probability for the specific route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n$P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process and Selection Rules:**\n    The problem describes a decay from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via a cascade of two electric dipole (E1) transitions. The process can be written as:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_1} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_2} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta n$: no restriction (but energy must decrease for spontaneous emission).\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n    *   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n        *   The initial state has $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, we get $l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, we get $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   For spontaneous emission, the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number must be $n' < 3$.\n    *   **Second transition:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   The final state has $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, we get $l_f - l' = 0 - l' = \\pm 1$. This confirms that the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Since the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ and $n'<3$, the only possibility for $n'$ is $n'=2$ (the state $|n'=1, l'=1\\rangle$ does not exist).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The intermediate state must be one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, where $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. The possible decay routes are:\n        *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n    $P(\\text{route}) = Br(\\text{step 1}) \\times Br(\\text{step 2})$\n\n    *   **Step 1: Branching ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric. Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the transition rates to each of the three magnetic sub-levels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state are equal.\n        The transition rate $\\Gamma_{i \\to f}$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$. For a transition from an $l=0$ state to an $l=1$ state, the Wigner-Eckart theorem shows that the transition probability is independent of the final magnetic quantum number $m'$.\n        Since there are three possible final states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$) and they are equally probable, the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them.\n        Therefore, the branching ratio for decaying into any specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n        $Br(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Branching ratio for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        From the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, the atom must decay to a state with lower energy ($n<2$) and satisfying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n        The only possible value for $n$ is $n=1$.\n        For $n=1$, the only possible value for $l$ is $l=0$.\n        Therefore, the only possible E1 decay channel from the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. This means the branching ratio for this step is 1.\n        $Br(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n4.  **Final Probability and Conclusion:**\n    Now we calculate the probability for the specific route given in option A: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    $P = Br(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times Br(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    $P = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n    Let's check the options:\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation.\n    *   B) Same path as A, but probability $\\frac{2}{3}$. This is incorrect.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. The path is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$. This is incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. The path is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$. This is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement among the choices is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nTo determine the correct transition route and probability for the decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions, we must apply the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Transition\nThe problem describes a two-step radiative cascade:\nInitial State: |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩, commonly known as the 3s state.\nFinal State: |n=1, l=0, m=0⟩, the ground state, or 1s state.\n\nThis process involves an intermediate state, |n', l', m'⟩. The decay happens through two successive electric dipole transitions.\n\n### 2. Applying Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for allowed electric dipole transitions are fundamental to determining the path. For a transition to occur, the change in the quantum numbers must satisfy:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly 1.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or 1.\n*   The principal quantum number *n* does not have a strict selection rule but must change (n' < n for decay).\n\n### 3. Determining the Transition Route\n**First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩**\n*   The initial state has l=0. According to the selection rule Δl = ±1, the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n*   The initial state has m=0. The selection rule Δm = 0, ±1 allows the intermediate state to have **m' = 0, +1, or -1**.\n*   The options provided suggest the intermediate state has a principal quantum number **n' = 2**.\n*   Thus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩. These correspond to the 2p subshell.\n\n**Second Transition: |n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n*   The intermediate state has l'=1. The final state has l=0. This satisfies Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is an allowed transition.\n*   The intermediate state has m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}. The final state has m=0. The change Δm = 0 - m' must satisfy |Δm| ≤ 1. This condition is met for all three possible m' values.\n\nTherefore, three possible cascade routes exist:\n1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability\nThe question asks for the probability of a *specific* transition route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first decay step.\n\n*   The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of a photon.\n*   Consequently, the decay probability is distributed equally among all possible final magnetic sublevels (m').\n*   The l'=1 state has (2l'+1) = 3 magnetic sublevels (m' = -1, 0, 1).\n*   Assuming the decay from the 3s state primarily goes to the 2p subshell, the probability of transitioning into any single one of these three states is equal.\n*   Therefore, the branching ratio for the decay into any specific m' state is 1/3.\n\nThe second step of the cascade, from any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, can only go to the |1,0,0⟩ ground state, as it is the only available lower energy level. Thus, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n\nThe total probability for any one of the specific routes is the product of the probabilities of each step:\nP(Route) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩) × P(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\n*   A) Incorrect probability (2/3).\n*   B) Correct route and correct probability (1/3).\n*   C) Incorrect probability (1/4).\n*   D) Incorrect probability (1/4).\n\nThe only option that presents a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules:** The problem describes a two-step electric dipole (E1) transition from an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the 3s state) to a final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the 1s state). The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State (First Transition):**\n    *   The initial state is $|3, 0, 0\\rangle$, which has $l=0$.\n    *   According to the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   According to the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0 - \\Delta m$, so $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n    *   For a cascade decay from $n=3$ to $n=1$, the most probable intermediate state will have $n'=2$.\n    *   Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Check the Second Transition:** The second transition is from an intermediate state $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n    *   For this step, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   The change in magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$, is also allowed for $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Therefore, all three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$. This confirms that the transition routes listed in the options are valid.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):** We need to find the probability of one specific path, for example, $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. This probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **First step probability:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Spontaneous emission from a spherically symmetric state is isotropic, meaning it does not have a preferred direction. Consequently, it populates all allowed final magnetic substates ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) with equal probability. Since there are three such states, the probability (or branching ratio) for transitioning to any single one of them is $1/3$.\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$.\n    *   **Second step probability:** The intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ (a 2p state) will decay to a state with lower energy. The only available state that satisfies the E1 selection rules is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, the probability of this transition occurring is essentially 1 (or 100%).\n        $P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) \\approx 1$.\n    *   **Total Probability:** The total probability for the entire cascade is the product of the probabilities of the individual steps:\n        $P_{total} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ has a probability of $1/3$. The same logic applies to the other two possible routes through $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$; they also each have a probability of $1/3$. Comparing our result with the options, option A is the only one that correctly identifies a valid path and its corresponding probability.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_h_atom_decay():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of H-atom decay from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0>.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define initial, intermediate, and final states based on selection rules.\n    initial_state = \"|3,0,0>\"\n    final_state = \"|1,0,0>\"\n    # E1 selection rules: delta_l = +/- 1, delta_m = 0, +/- 1.\n    # From l=0, intermediate state must have l=1.\n    # From m=0, intermediate state can have m' = -1, 0, 1.\n    # For a cascade, we consider the n=2 intermediate state.\n    intermediate_states = [\"|2,1,-1>\", \"|2,1,0>\", \"|2,1,1>\"]\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the probability of the first transition.\n    # The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric.\n    # Spontaneous emission populates the 3 possible m' states of the l=1 orbital equally.\n    num_intermediate_states = len(intermediate_states)\n    prob_step1 = sympy.Rational(1, num_intermediate_states)\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the probability of the second transition.\n    # The intermediate 2p state (|2,1,m'>) decays almost exclusively to the 1s state (|1,0,0>).\n    # Other decays are either forbidden or highly suppressed.\n    prob_step2 = 1\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the total probability for one specific cascade path.\n    # Example path: |3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0>\n    total_prob = prob_step1 * prob_step2\n    \n    # Step 5: Format the output and select the correct option.\n    print(\"Problem Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"The decay is a two-step dipole transition from {initial_state} to {final_state}.\")\n    print(\"The electric dipole selection rules are \\\\Delta l = \\\\pm 1 and \\\\Delta m = 0, \\\\pm 1.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: First Transition (|3,0,0> -> intermediate state)\")\n    print(f\"The initial state has l=0.

The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. We need to find a valid intermediate state and the probability of that specific decay path. The state is denoted by $|n, l, m\\rangle$, where $n$ is the principal quantum number, $l$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $m$ is the magnetic quantum number.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an atom to transition from an initial state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$ to a final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle$ by emitting a single photon (electric dipole transition), the following selection rules must be obeyed:\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n = n_f - n_i$, can be any integer.\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Transition:**\n    *   Initial state: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. So, $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n    *   Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l' = 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n    *   The options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is an energetically allowed decay, as the energy of the $n=3$ state is higher than the $n=2$ state ($E_n \\propto -1/n^2$).\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Transition:**\n    *   Intermediate state: $|n', l', m'\\rangle = |2, 1, m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Final state: $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. So, $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = -m'$. For this to be allowed, $-m'$ must be in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which means $m'$ must be in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   This confirms that all three potential intermediate states identified in Step 3 can indeed decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an E1 transition.\n    *   Therefore, the possible routes are:\n        *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Transition Probability:** The probability of a specific decay route is the product of the branching ratios for each step.\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the first step:** We need to find the relative probability for the atom in state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to decay into each of the possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. The transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle n'l'm' | e\\vec{r} | nlm \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space for this state.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the available magnetic sublevels of the final state. In this case, the final state has $l'=1$, which has three sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   Therefore, the transition rates to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are all equal.\n    *   Since these are the only three possible states for the first step (in the $n=2$ shell), the probability is distributed equally among them.\n    *   The branching ratio for the transition to any specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is thus $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the second step:** Now consider the decay from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   The only state with a lower principal quantum number that can be reached via an E1 transition is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (since $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$).\n    *   Other decays, like $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,0,0\\rangle$, are possible by selection rules, but the energy difference (the Lamb shift) is minuscule compared to the $2p \\rightarrow 1s$ energy difference.

For a decay process (emission), $n$ must decrease.\n\nThe problem describes a two-step cascade decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Selection rule for $l$**: Since $l_{initial}=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 0 \\pm 1 = 1$.\n*   **Selection rule for $m$**: Since $m_{initial}=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0 + (0, \\pm 1) = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Selection rule for $n$**: For a decay, $n' < n$. The problem options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is the most probable transition as it has a smaller change in $n$.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. All paths shown in the options go through one of these states, so they are all valid routes.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.**\n\n*   **Intermediate state:** $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$, with $n'=2, l'=1, m' \\in \\{1,0,-1\\}$.\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$, with $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Selection rule for $l$**: $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Selection rule for $m$**: $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate $m' \\in \\{1,0,-1\\}$.\n    *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. Allowed.\n    *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. Allowed.\n    *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = +1$. Allowed.\n\nSo, all three cascade paths are allowed:\n*   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nNow, we must determine the probability, which corresponds to the branching ratio for a given route. The probability of a cascade is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n**Branching Ratio for Step 1:**\n\nThe transition rate for spontaneous emission from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is given by:\n$\\Gamma_{i \\to f} \\propto |\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$\nwhere $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2$.\n\nWe need to compare the rates for the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the three possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n*   $\\Gamma_0 \\propto |\\langle 2,1,0 | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n*   $\\Gamma_1 \\propto |\\langle 2,1,1 | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n*   $\\Gamma_{-1} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,-1 | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). A spherically symmetric state has no preferred orientation in space. Therefore, when it decays, it must populate the degenerate final substates $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ equally. This physical intuition implies that the transition rates are equal:\n$\\Gamma_0 = \\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma_{-1}$\n\nA formal calculation using the Wigner-Eckart theorem or by calculating the matrix elements directly (using line strength formulas) confirms this result. The relative strengths for the transition from $l=0, m=0$ to $l'=1, m'=\\{1,0,-1\\}$ are in the ratio 1:1:1.\n\nSince there are three equally probable decay channels to the $2p$ subshell, the total rate is $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_{-1} = 3\\Gamma_0$. The branching ratio for the decay into any specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n$BR(\\text{step 1, to } m') = \\frac{\\Gamma_{m'}}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Branching Ratio for Step 2:**\n\nFor the second step, the atom is in one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states. The only possible decay via an electric dipole transition is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Any other transition is either forbidden or involves a much weaker mechanism. For example, decay to the $|2,0,0\\rangle$ state is forbidden by $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$. Decay to higher states is impossible. Therefore, the branching ratio for the second step, regardless of the intermediate state, is 1.\n$BR(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n**Total Probability of the Cascade Route**\n\nThe total probability (or combined branching ratio) for a specific route is the product of the branching ratios of its steps. For the route specified in options A and C: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nProbability = $BR(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times BR(|2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$\nProbability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSimilarly, the probability for the routes through $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ would also be $1/3$.\n\nNow we check the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$.

These rules dictate which transitions are \"allowed\" to occur.\n\nThe selection rules for a transition from a state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ to $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ are:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n\nLet's analyze the proposed decay route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$:\n\n1.  **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   Intermediate state: $n'=2, l'=1, m'=0$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = 1 - 0 = +1$. This is an allowed transition.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0 - 0 = 0$. This is also an allowed transition.\n    Therefore, the first step of the decay is valid according to the selection rules.\n\n2.  **Second transition: $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Intermediate state: $n=2, l=1, m=0$.\n    *   Final state: $n'=1, l'=0, m'=0$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0 - 0 = 0$. This is also an allowed transition.\n    Therefore, the second step is also valid. The entire cascade is an allowed process.\n\nNext, we must determine the probability of this specific decay channel. The decay process begins with the transition from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (or 3s) state. The only allowed decay according to the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule is to a state with $l=1$ (a p-state). For $n=2$, this corresponds to the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (or 2p) states.\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). Because of this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. This means that the three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are populated with equal probability. The total probability of transitioning to one of these three states is 1, so the probability for transitioning to any specific one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nOnce the atom is in the intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it must decay to a lower energy level. The only possible final state via an electric dipole transition is $|1,0,0\\rangle$, as it is the only state that satisfies the selection rules for a subsequent decay. Thus, the probability of the second step, $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, is 1.\n\nThe total probability for the cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n$P(\\text{total}) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThis matches the path and probability described in option A.\n\nThe correct transition route and probability are:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state to a final state via dipole transitions is governed by a set of selection rules. This two-step transition from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state must adhere to these rules at each step.\n\n### Analysis of the Transition Route\n\n**1. Dipole Transition Selection Rules:**\nFor a non-relativistic hydrogen atom, electric dipole transitions are subject to the following selection rules for the quantum numbers *l* (azimuthal or orbital angular momentum) and *m* (magnetic):\n*   **Δl = ±1**\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**\n\nThe principal quantum number *n* must decrease for a decay process (n<sub>final</sub> < n<sub>initial</sub>).\n\n**2. First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → Intermediate State |n',l',m'⟩**\n*   The initial state has *n*=3, *l*=0, and *m*=0.\n*   For the first decay step, *l* must change by ±1. Since *l*=0, the only possibility is **Δl = +1**, meaning the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n*   The magnetic quantum number *m* can change by 0 or ±1. Since the initial *m*=0, the possible values for the intermediate state's magnetic quantum number are **m' = -1, 0, or 1**.\n*   The principal quantum number *n* must be less than 3. The options provided suggest an intermediate state with **n' = 2**.\n*   Combining these, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n**3. Second Transition: Intermediate State |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n*   The final state is |1,0,0⟩, which has *l*=0.\n*   For the transition from the intermediate state (*l'*=1) to the final state (*l*=0), the change is **Δl = 0 - 1 = -1**. This is an allowed transition.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = 0 - m', also satisfies the selection rules for all possible m' values (-1, 0, 1).\n*   Therefore, all three potential pathways are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This corresponds to the branching ratio for that particular decay cascade.\n\n1.  **First Step Branching Ratio:** The decay starts from the |3,0,0⟩ state. This state is spherically symmetric (since *l*=0). Because of this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the first photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three possible intermediate states: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,1⟩. The total probability must be 1, so the probability of transitioning into any single one of these states is 1/3.\n\n2.  **Second Step Branching Ratio:** Once the atom is in one of the |2,1,m'⟩ states (a 2p orbital), it must decay to a lower energy level. The only state with *n*=1 that satisfies the Δl=±1 rule is the |1,0,0⟩ state (the 1s ground state). Decay to the |2,0,0⟩ state is forbidden. Therefore, the probability of the second step, |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, is 1 for any of the three intermediate states.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe overall probability for any of the specific two-step decay routes is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n*   P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩) = 1/3\n*   P(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = 1\n\nThus, the probability for the specific route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ is (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) Probability of 1/4 is incorrect.\n*   B) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3 is correct.\n*   C) Probability of 1/4 is incorrect.\n*   D) Probability of 2/3 is incorrect.\n\nThe correct transition route and probability are:\n$$ |3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{1}{3} $$\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a two-step radiative decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ to the final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1, 0, 0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. This is also known as a cascade decay.\n\n2.  **Recall Selection Rules:** Electric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers:\n    *   Change in principal quantum number, $\\Delta n = n_{final} - n_{initial}$: can be any integer. For decay (emission), energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n    *   Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial}$: must be $\\pm 1$.\n    *   Change in magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial}$: must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade.\n\n    *   **First Transition: $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n        *   $\\Delta n = n' - 3 < 0 \\implies n' < 3$. So, $n'$ can be 1 or 2.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$ (since $l'$ must be non-negative).\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition: $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$**\n        *   $\\Delta n = 1 - n' < 0 \\implies n' > 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = 0 - l' = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$. This is consistent with the first transition.\n        *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This implies that the initial $m'$ for this step could be $0, 1, -1$, which is also consistent.\n\n    *   **Combining the constraints on $n'$**: From the first transition, $n' < 3$. From the second, $n' > 1$. Therefore, the only possible value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n' = 2$.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for the intermediate state:** The intermediate state must be of the form $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$, where $m'$ can be $-1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n\n4.  **Identify the Possible Decay Routes:** Based on the possible intermediate states, there are three distinct routes for the cascade decay:\n    *   **Route 1:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   **Route 2:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   **Route 3:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n    All the options in the question list one of these valid routes.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):** The question asks for the probability associated with a specific route. In this context, this refers to the branching ratio: the fraction of decays from the initial state that proceed through that particular intermediate state. The branching ratio is determined by the relative rates of the first transition.\n\n    The rate of spontaneous emission (Einstein A coefficient) for a transition from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n    $A_{i \\rightarrow f} \\propto \\omega_{if}^3 |\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\mathbf{d} = -e\\mathbf{r}$ is the electric dipole operator.\n\n    We need to compare the rates for the three possible first transitions:\n    *   $A_0: |3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$\n    *   $A_1: |3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle$\n    *   $A_{-1}: |3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle$\n\n    Since the energy difference (and thus the frequency $\\omega$) is the same for all three transitions (from $n=3$ to $n=2$), the relative rates are determined solely by the squared matrix elements $|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    A key physical principle simplifies this calculation: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, meaning it is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to emit a photon in any direction, leading to any of the allowed final $m'$ states. The decay rates to the different magnetic sublevels $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be identical.\n\n    *   $A_0 = A_1 = A_{-1}$\n\n    Since there are three equally probable channels for the first decay step, the total rate is $A_{total} = A_0 + A_1 + A_{-1} = 3A_0$. The probability, or branching ratio, for any single channel (e.g., the one going through $|2,1,0\\rangle$) is:\n    $P(\\text{via } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{A_0}{A_{total}} = \\frac{A_0}{3A_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    Similarly, the branching ratios for the other two routes are also $1/3$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

The route is valid, and the calculated probability (branching ratio) is correct.\n\nTherefore, option D provides a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process:** The problem describes a two-step electric dipole transition in a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is a cascade decay. A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden by the dipole selection rules, as the change in orbital angular momentum quantum number $\\Delta l$ would be 0, but the rule requires $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Intermediate State:** The transition must proceed through an intermediate state, let's call it $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$. The options suggest the intermediate state has a principal quantum number $n_i=2$.\n\n3.  **Apply Selection Rules for the First Transition:**\n    *   Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,l_i,m_i\\rangle$.\n    *   Selection rule for $l$: $\\Delta l = l_i - l_{initial} = l_i - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l_i=1$.\n    *   Selection rule for $m$: $\\Delta m = m_i - m_{initial} = m_i - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. Since $l_i=1$, the possible values for $m_i$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n    *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply Selection Rules for the Second Transition:**\n    *   Transition: $|2,1,m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Selection rule for $l$: $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_i = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n    *   Selection rule for $m$: $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_i = 0 - m_i$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible values of $m_i$ (i.e., for $m_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$).\n    *   Therefore, all three paths are allowed by the selection rules:\n        *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) for each path:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the branching ratios of each step. The branching ratio for a particular decay channel is the rate of that decay divided by the total decay rate of the initial state.\n\n    *   **First step: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_i\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space.\n        *   Therefore, the emission of the photon is isotropic in the sense that the atom is equally likely to transition to any of the allowed final magnetic sublevels ($m_i = -1, 0, 1$).\n        *   More formally, the transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle 2,1,m_i | e\\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, it can be shown that this quantity is independent of $m_i$ when the initial state has $m=0$.\n        *   Since the rates to the three intermediate states are equal, and these are the only allowed dipole transitions to the $n=2$ shell, the probability of transitioning to any one of them is the same.\n        *   Total decay channels to $n=2, l=1$: 3.\n        *   Probability (Branching Ratio) for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$ = $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n        *   Probability (Branching Ratio) for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle$ = $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n        *   Probability (Branching Ratio) for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle$ = $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Second step: $|2,1,m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   We need to consider the total decay rate from the intermediate state $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$.\n        *   According to the dipole selection rules, the state $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ (a $2p$ state) can decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the $1s$ state).\n        *   In the non-relativistic theory of the H-atom, the energy levels depend only on the principal quantum number $n$. Thus, $E_{2s} = E_{2p}$. A transition from $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ to $|2,0,0\\rangle$ would have zero energy difference ($\\omega=0$) and is therefore forbidden (it does occur via the Lamb shift, but that is a relativistic QED effect).\n        *   Therefore, the only available decay channel for the $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ state via a single dipole transition is to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   This means the branching ratio for the second step is 1, regardless of the intermediate $m_i$ value. $P(|2,1,m_i\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n    *   **Total Probability for a Specific Path:**\n        *   The probability for the path passing through $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is:\n            $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is a valid route. The probability of the cascade proceeding via this specific path is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches option D. The other paths through $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ also have a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$, which makes options B and C incorrect. Option A has the correct path but an incorrect probability.\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\nThe problem describes a two-step radiative decay of a hydrogen atom from the excited state |3,0,0> to the ground state |1,0,0>. Each step is an electric dipole transition, which means they must obey the electric dipole selection rules. The process can be written as:\n|3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\nOur goal is to identify the intermediate state |n',l',m'⟩ and the probability of this specific decay channel.\n\n### 2. Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nFor an electric dipole transition from an initial state |n,l,m⟩ to a final state |n',l',m'⟩, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n*   **Δl = l' - l = ±1**\n*   **Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1**\n*   For a decay (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so **n' < n**.\n\n### 3. Step 1: First Transition (|3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩)\nLet's apply the selection rules to the initial state |i⟩ = |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0).\n\n*   **Rule for l:** Since l=0, Δl must be +1 (because l cannot be negative). Therefore, the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n*   **Rule for n:** For a state with orbital quantum number l', the principal quantum number n' must be at least l'+1. Since l'=1, we must have n' ≥ 2. Also, due to the decay, n' < n, so n' < 3. The only integer satisfying both n' ≥ 2 and n' < 3 is **n' = 2**.\n*   **Rule for m:** Since m=0, the change Δm can be 0, +1, or -1. Thus, the intermediate magnetic quantum number can be m' = m + Δm = 0 + (0, ±1), which gives **m' = -1, 0, or +1**.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n### 4. Step 2: Second Transition (|n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\nNow, we must check if a transition from these intermediate states to the final state |f⟩ = |1,0,0⟩ is allowed.\n\n*   **Rule for l:** The change is Δl = l_final - l_intermediate = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the Δl=±1 rule.\n*   **Rule for m:** The change is Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m'. For this to be allowed (Δm=0,±1), m' must be one of {-1, 0, 1}. All three of our possible intermediate states satisfy this.\n\nTherefore, all three decay paths are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the probability of a *specific* route. This is the branching ratio of the first transition. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is a 3s orbital, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, space is isotropic (has no preferred direction). Therefore, there is no reason for the atom to prefer decaying to one m' state over another. The three possible destination states (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩) are degenerate in energy.\n\nThis symmetry implies that the transition rates to these three states must be equal. Let the probability of transitioning to |2,1,m'⟩ be P(m').\nThen, **P(-1) = P(0) = P(1)**.\n\nSince these three paths are the only possible outcomes for the first decay step, their probabilities must sum to 1:\nP_total = P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1\n3 × P(0) = 1\n**P(0) = 1/3**\n\nSo, the probability for the specific route passing through |2,1,0⟩ is 1/3. The same probability of 1/3 applies to the routes passing through |2,1,-1⟩ and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n### 6. Comparing with the Options\nLet's examine the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4:** The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3:** The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   **C) ⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3:** The probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4:** The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that matches our analysis is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nAnswering this question requires understanding the selection rules for electric dipole transitions in a hydrogen atom and calculating the branching ratios for the possible decay paths.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Transition Route\n\nThe atom transitions from the initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$ via two dipole transitions. This implies the existence of an intermediate state, let's call it $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$.\n\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole (E1) transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n\n**First Transition: $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Change in $l$**: The initial state has $l=0$. According to the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l_i = 1$.\n*   **Change in $m$**: The initial state has $m=0$. According to the selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m_i = 0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n*   **Change in $n$**: For a decay (emission) process, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease. Since the final state is $n=1$, the intermediate state must have $n_i=2$. A transition from $n=3$ to $n=1$ directly is forbidden by the $\\Delta l$ rule.\n*   **Intermediate States**: Combining these, the possible intermediate states are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|2, 1, m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$**\n\nLet's check if transitions from our identified intermediate states to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$ are allowed.\n*   **Change in $l$**: The initial (intermediate) state has $l_i=1$, and the final state has $l_f=0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Change in $m$**: The final state has $m_f=0$. The initial (intermediate) state can have $m_i = -1, 0, 1$. The change is $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = -m_i$. In all cases (for $m_i = -1, 0, 1$), $\\Delta m$ will be $1, 0,$ or $-1$, which is allowed.\n\nSo, all three possible routes are valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThe options presented in the question (A, B, C) all list one of these valid routes. To find the correct answer, we must calculate the probability of these routes.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Probability\n\nThe \"probability\" of a specific transition route in a cascade process refers to the branching ratio of the first step. This is because once the atom reaches one of the intermediate $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ states, it has only one allowed dipole transition to a lower energy state, which is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of the second step, given the first has occurred, is 1.\n\nThe branching ratio for the decay into a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ is:\n$P(m_i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m_i\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m'=-1,0,1} \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)}$\nwhere $\\Gamma(i \\to f)$ is the transition rate from state $i$ to state $f$.\n\nThe transition rate for spontaneous emission is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the electric dipole matrix element:\n$\\Gamma(i \\to f) \\propto |\\langle f | e\\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = e^2 |\\langle f | \\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2$\n\nWe need to compare the rates $\\Gamma$ for the three possible values of $m_i (-1, 0, 1)$.\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). When an unpolarized atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the sublevels of the final state are populated equally.\n\nLet's verify this with a calculation. The rate is proportional to:\n$|\\langle 2,1,m_i | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,m_i | x | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m_i | y | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m_i | z | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nUsing the properties of spherical harmonics, one can show that:\n*   The matrix element of $z$ ($z=r\\cos\\theta \\propto Y_{1,0}$) is non-zero only for transitions where $\\Delta m = 0$. So, it only contributes to the decay to $|2,1,0\\rangle$.\n*   The matrix elements of $x$ and $y$ (which are linear combinations of $r Y_{1,1}$ and $r Y_{1,-1}$) are non-zero only for transitions where $\\Delta m = \\pm 1$. They contribute to the decays to $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\nA detailed calculation of the integrals shows that the total transition probability, summed over all polarizations, is independent of the final magnetic quantum number $m_i$:\n$|\\langle 2,1,-1 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,0 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,1 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nSince the energy difference $\\Delta E = E_{3s} - E_{2p}$ is the same for all three transitions, the transition rates are equal:\n$\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\nLet this rate be $\\Gamma_0$. The total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $|2,1\\rangle$ manifold is $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n\nThe probability (branching ratio) for any one of these specific paths is:\n$P = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nEach of the three possible decay routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. Now we check the given options:\n\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$.

The probability is incorrect.\nD) ...$\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nA transição do estado $|3,0,0\\rangle$ para o estado $|1,0,0\\rangle$ no átomo de hidrogénio através de duas transições de dipolo ocorre em cascata, envolvendo um estado intermédio.\n\n**Passo 1: Analisar a primeira transição de $|3,0,0\\rangle$ para um estado intermédio $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.**\n\nAs regras de seleção para transições de dipolo elétrico (E1) são:\n*   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ pode ser qualquer valor, mas para uma emissão (decaimento), a energia deve diminuir, então $n' < n$.\n\nPara o estado inicial $|3,0,0\\rangle$, temos $n=3$, $l=0$ e $m=0$.\n*   Aplicando $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, como $l=0$, o estado intermédio deve ter $l' = 1$.\n*   Aplicando $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, como $m=0$, o estado intermédio pode ter $m' = 0, +1$ ou $-1$.\n*   Para que ocorra uma segunda transição para o estado final $n=1$, o estado intermédio deve ter $n' = 2$.\n\nPortanto, os possíveis estados intermédios são $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$ e $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Passo 2: Analisar a segunda transição de $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ para o estado final $|1,0,0\\rangle$.**\n\nPara os estados intermédios $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ e o estado final $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n*   $l'=1$ e $l_{final}=0$, então $\\Delta l = -1$, o que é permitido.\n*   $m'$ pode ser $-1, 0$ ou $1$, e $m_{final}=0$. Em todos os casos, $\\Delta m$ será $0$ ou $\\pm 1$, o que é permitido.\n\nAssim, todas as três rotas de transição são possíveis:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**Passo 3: Calcular a probabilidade da rota de transição.**\n\nA probabilidade total de uma rota em cascata é o produto das probabilidades de cada passo. O primeiro passo é o decaimento do estado $|3,0,0\\rangle$ para um dos três subníveis $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\nO estado inicial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (um estado 3s) é esfericamente simétrico. Na ausência de campos externos, não há direção preferencial no espaço. Portanto, a probabilidade de transição para cada um dos subníveis magnéticos $m'=-1, 0, +1$ do estado $l'=1$ (um estado 2p) é a mesma.\n\nA taxa de transição total do estado $|3,0,0\\rangle$ para o nível $n=2, l=1$ é a soma das taxas para os três subníveis $m'$:\n$\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma(m'=-1) + \\Gamma(m'=0) + \\Gamma(m'=+1)$\n\nComo as taxas são iguais:\n$\\Gamma(m'=-1) = \\Gamma(m'=0) = \\Gamma(m'=+1)$\n\nA fração de ramificação (a probabilidade de decair para um subnível específico $m'$) é:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(m')}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma(m')}{3 \\times \\Gamma(m')} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nUma vez que o átomo está no estado intermédio (qualquer um dos $|2,1,m'\\rangle$), a única transição de dipolo permitida para um nível de energia inferior é para o estado fundamental $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Portanto, a probabilidade deste segundo passo é 1.\n\nA probabilidade total para a rota de transição $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ é o produto da fração de ramificação do primeiro passo e a probabilidade do segundo passo:\n$P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nComparando com as opções fornecidas:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ e $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Probabilidade incorreta)\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ e $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Rota e probabilidade corretas)\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ e $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Probabilidade incorreta)\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ e $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Probabilidade incorreta)\n\nA resposta correta é a B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state is a two-photon process, as a single-photon transition is forbidden by the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. The decay must proceed through an intermediate state.\n\n**1. Selection Rules:**\nFor an electric dipole transition, the selection rules for the orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* and the magnetic quantum number *m* are:\n*   Δ*l* = *l*<sub>final</sub> - *l*<sub>initial</sub> = ±1\n*   Δ*m* = *m*<sub>final</sub> - *m*<sub>initial</sub> = 0, ±1\n\n**2. Identifying the Transition Route:**\nThe process occurs in two steps:\n*   **Step 1:** Transition from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩.\n    *   Applying the selection rules to the initial state |*n*=3, *l*=0, *m*=0⟩:\n        *   Δ*l* = *l'* - 0 = ±1  ⇒ *l'* = 1.\n        *   Δ*m* = *m'* - 0 = 0, ±1 ⇒ *m'* can be 0, 1, or -1.\n    *   For a decay, the principal quantum number *n* must decrease. A prominent intermediate state is the *n'*=2 level.

The other possible routes through |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩ are also valid.\n\n**3. Determining the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio):**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific decay route. This refers to the branching ratio of the initial decay step. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (a 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. When it decays, it can transition to any of the three degenerate sublevels of the 2p state: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\nBecause the initial state is spherically symmetric and in the absence of any external polarizing fields, the probability of transitioning to any of the available degenerate final states is equal. The 2p state has three such sublevels (*m'* = -1, 0, 1).\n\nTherefore, the total probability of 1 is distributed equally among these three channels:\n*   Probability(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = 1/3\n*   Probability(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = 1/3\n*   Probability(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩) = 1/3\n\nThe transition from the 2p state to the 1s state is extremely fast, so the probability of the second step is nearly 1. The overall probability of the cascade is thus determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\nBased on this analysis, the probability for the transition route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) Probability of 2/3 is incorrect.\n*   B) Probability of 1/4 is incorrect.\n*   C) Probability of 1/4 is incorrect.\n*   D) Proposes the route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3, which matches our derivation.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThe problem asks for the correct decay route and corresponding probability for a Hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade process through an intermediate state $|k\\rangle$:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_1} |k\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_2} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nWe must first identify the allowed intermediate states $|k\\rangle = |n_k, l_k, m_k\\rangle$ using the selection rules for E1 transitions:\n$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n$\\Delta n$ can be anything, but for spontaneous emission, the energy of the state must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|k\\rangle = |n_k, l_k, m_k\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\implies n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n*   For an E1 transition, $\\Delta l = l_k - l_i = l_k - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l_k = 1$.\n*   For the selection rule on $m$, $\\Delta m = m_k - m_i = m_k - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, $m_k$ can be $0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n*   Since the final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$, the intermediate state must have $n_k=2$ for a cascade decay ($E_3 > E_2 > E_1$).\n*   Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m_k\\rangle$ to $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$**\nLet's check if transitions from these intermediate states to the final state are allowed.\n*   Initial state: $|2,1,m_k\\rangle \\implies n_k=2, l_k=1, m_k \\in \\{1,0,-1\\}$.\n*   Final state: $|1,0,0\\rangle \\implies n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_k = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_k = 0 - m_k$. This requires $\\Delta m = 0$ for $m_k=0$, $\\Delta m = -1$ for $m_k=1$, and $\\Delta m = +1$ for $m_k=-1$. All these values for $\\Delta m$ are allowed.\n*   Therefore, all three paths are possible according to the selection rules:\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**Calculating the Probability**\n\nThe \"probability\" of a given route corresponds to its branching ratio. The branching ratio for a specific path is determined by the probability of the first transition, assuming the intermediate state has only one subsequent decay channel leading to the final state.\n\nIn the non-relativistic theory of the H-atom, energy levels depend only on $n$. Therefore, a state with $n=2, l=1$ (a $2p$ state) can only decay to a state with $n=1$. The only state with $n=1$ is $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the $1s$ state). Thus, the transition from any of the $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$ states to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ has a probability of 1.\n\nThe overall probability for each path is therefore equal to the branching ratio of the first step: the transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to one of the $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$ states.\n\nThe transition rate $A(i \\to f)$ is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, summed over all possible polarizations of the emitted photon: $A(i \\to f) \\propto |\\langle f |e\\vec{r}| i \\rangle|^2 = e^2 \\sum_q |\\langle f |r_q| i \\rangle|^2$.\n\nLet's find the rate for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m_k\\rangle$:\n$A(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m_k) \\propto \\sum_q |\\langle 2,1,m_k | r_q | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\nFrom the selection rule on $m$, $m_{final} = m_{initial} + q$, we have $m_k = 0 + q$, so $q=m_k$. This means for each final state $m_k$, only one term in the sum is non-zero.\n$A(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m_k) \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m_k | r_{m_k} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n\nWe can evaluate this using the Wigner-Eckart theorem:\n$\\langle n'l'm'|T_q^k|nlm\\rangle = \\frac{\\langle n'l'||T^k||nl\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2l'+1}}\\langle lm;kq|l'm'\\rangle$.\nFor our transition, $|nlm\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, $|n'l'm'\\rangle = |2,1,m_k\\rangle$, $k=1$, and $q=m_k$:\n$\\langle 2,1,m_k|r_{m_k}|3,0,0\\rangle = \\frac{\\langle 2,1||r||3,0\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2(1)+1}}\\langle 0,0;1,m_k|1,m_k\\rangle$.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 0,0;1,m_k|1,m_k\\rangle = 1$ for all allowed values of $m_k$ (i.e., -1, 0, 1).\nThe reduced matrix element $\\langle 2,1||r||3,0\\rangle$ is a constant that does not depend on any of the magnetic quantum numbers.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the matrix element is the same for all three final states $m_k$:\n$|\\langle 2,1,m_k|r_{m_k}|3,0,0\\rangle|^2 = |\\frac{\\langle 2,1||r||3,0\\rangle}{\\sqrt{3}}|^2$.\n\nThis means the transition rates to each of the three intermediate states are equal. Let the rate be $A_1$.\n$A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) = A_1$\n$A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = A_1$\n$A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = A_1$\n\nThe total transition rate out of $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (into the $2p$ shell) is $A_{total} = A_1 + A_1 + A_1 = 3A_1$.\nThe branching ratio for any one of these paths is the rate for that path divided by the total rate:\n$B = \\frac{A_1}{3A_1} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSo, each of the three possible decay routes has a probability of $1/3$.\nLet's check the options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\nD) $\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions follows specific quantum mechanical selection rules. This process is a cascade decay, where the atom first transitions to an intermediate state and then to the final state.\n\n**Step 1: First Dipole Transition**\n\nThe initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0>, which corresponds to the 3s orbital. According to the electric dipole transition selection rules, the orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* must change by ±1 (Δ*l* = ±1), and the magnetic quantum number *m* can change by 0 or ±1 (Δ*m* = 0, ±1).\n\n*   From *l*=0, the only possibility is a transition to *l*=1 (a *p* orbital).\n*   The principal quantum number *n* must decrease, so a transition to *n*=2 is required for a two-step decay to *n*=1. A direct decay to *n=1* would require a change in *l*, resulting in a |1,1,m> state, but this is not the final state |1,0,0>.\n*   For the transition from |3,0,0> to a state with *l*=1, the magnetic quantum number *m* can become -1, 0, or 1.\n\nThis means the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. Since the initial |3,0,0> state is spherically symmetric and the decay process is isotropic (assuming no external fields), the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of these three *m* sub-levels. Therefore, the probability of transitioning into any specific intermediate state, such as |2,1,0>, is 1/3.\n\n**Step 2: Second Dipole Transition**\n\nThe second transition is from the intermediate state |2,1,m> to the final state |1,0,0> (the 1s orbital). Let's check the selection rules for each possible intermediate state:\n\n*   **From |2,1,0> to |1,0,0>**: Δ*l* = 1 → 0 = -1 (allowed), and Δ*m* = 0 → 0 = 0 (allowed). This is a valid transition.\n*   **From |2,1,1> to |1,0,0>**: Δ*l* = 1 → 0 = -1 (allowed), and Δ*m* = 1 → 0 = -1 (allowed). This is a valid transition.\n*   **From |2,1,-1> to |1,0,0>**: Δ*l* = 1 → 0 = -1 (allowed), and Δ*m* = -1 → 0 = +1 (allowed). This is a valid transition.\n\nFrom any of the |2,1,m> states, the only energetically favorable state that can be reached via a single dipole transition is the |1,0,0> state. Therefore, the probability of this second step occurring from any of the allowed intermediate states is 1 (or 100%).\n\n**Overall Probability**\n\nThe total probability for a specific decay path is the product of the probabilities of each individual step. For the path |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>:\n\n*   Probability = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) × P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>)\n*   Probability = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\nTherefore, the transition route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> has a total probability of 1/3.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle \\text{ and } \\frac{1}{3}}$\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nMy plan is to determine the correct transition route and its probability based on the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions in a Hydrogen atom.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Selection Rules**: First, I will state the E1 selection rules, which govern which transitions are allowed. These rules are $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. The principal quantum number $n$ must also change.\n2.  **Verify the Transition Routes**: I will apply these rules to the proposed two-step decay: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$. I will confirm that both steps in the routes listed in the options are allowed by the selection rules.\n3.  **Calculate the Probabilities**: The core of the problem is to determine the probability of each route. For a cascade decay, the probability of a specific path is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, assuming the second step is guaranteed (which it is, as the $2p$ state can only decay to the $1s$ state). The branching ratio depends on the transition rates.\n4.  **Evaluate Transition Rates**: I will use the fact that the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). For spontaneous emission from such a state, the transition rates to each of the possible magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the final $l'=1$ state are identical.\n5.  **Determine Branching Ratios**: Since there are three equally probable intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$), the probability of branching into any single one of them is $1/3$.\n6.  **Select the Correct Option**: Finally, I will compare this result with the given options to find the one that correctly pairs a valid route with the calculated probability of $1/3$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_h_atom_decay():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of H-atom cascade decay from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0>.\n\n    The function applies the selection rules for electric dipole transitions and\n    calculates the probability of the specified decay routes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the problem and selection rules\n    initial_state = \"|3,0,0>\"\n    final_state = \"|1,0,0>\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing the two-step dipole transition from {initial_state} to {final_state}.\")\n    print(\"The selection rules for an electric dipole (E1) transition are:\")\n    print(\"Δl = ±1\")\n    print(\"Δm = 0, ±1\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the proposed transition routes\n    print(\"The decay proceeds through an intermediate state, specified in the options as |2,1,m'>.\")\n\n    # First transition: |3,0,0> -> |2,1,m'>\n    # l=0 -> l'=1 satisfies Δl = +1.\n    # m=0 -> m' can be -1, 0, or 1, which satisfies Δm = -1, 0, +1.\n    # n=3 -> n'=2 means energy is released.\n    # This step is valid.\n\n    # Second transition: |2,1,m'> -> |1,0,0>\n    # l'=1 -> l''=0 satisfies Δl = -1.\n    # m' -> m''=0 implies Δm = -m'.

This decay occurs not directly, but \"via two dipole transition\". This implies a cascade process: a sequence of two electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n*   **Initial State ($|i\\rangle$):** $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (also known as the 3s state).\n*   **Final State ($|f\\rangle$):** $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the ground state, 1s).\n*   **Intermediate State ($|k\\rangle$):** We need to determine the quantum numbers $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ of this state.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Dipole 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Dipole 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions\nFor a transition to be allowed under the electric dipole approximation, the following selection rules must be met:\n1.  The parity must change. The parity of a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ is given by $(-1)^l$. A change in parity means $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial}$ must be an odd integer.\n2.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n3.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n4.  The principal quantum number $n$ can change by any integer value ($\\Delta n = \\text{any integer}$). For a decay (photon emission), the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$\nLet's apply the selection rules to find the possible intermediate states $|k\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Rule for $\\Delta l$:** $\\Delta l = l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Rule for $\\Delta n$:** The atom decays, so energy decreases. Thus, $n' < n=3$. The problem options suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$, which is allowed. Any other $n'$ is not mentioned in the options. So we consider $n'=2$.\n*   **Rule for $\\Delta m$:** $\\Delta m = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $0, +1, -1$.\n\nCombining these, the possible intermediate states are:\n*   $|2,1,0\\rangle$\n*   $|2,1,1\\rangle$\n*   $|2,1,-1\\rangle$\nThese correspond to the three degenerate substates of the 2p orbital.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\nLet's check if the second step is allowed for each of the possible intermediate states.\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **For intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$:**\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$ (Allowed).\n    *   This transition is allowed. The route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is possible.\n*   **For intermediate state $|2,1,1\\rangle$:**\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   This transition is allowed. The route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is possible.\n*   **For intermediate state $|2,1,-1\\rangle$:**\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$ (Allowed).\n    *   This transition is allowed. The route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is possible.\n\nAll three routes suggested by the selection rules are physically possible.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Probability of the Transition Route\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. In a cascade decay, this corresponds to the branching ratio of the first transition, assuming the intermediate state decays with 100% probability to the final state (which is true here, as the only dipole-allowed decay from 2p is to 1s).\n\nThe probability of the route via $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is given by:\n$P(\\text{route via } m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m''=-1}^{1} \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m''\\rangle)}$\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is the transition rate.\n\nThe transition rate $\\Gamma(i \\to f)$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n$\\Gamma(i \\to f) \\propto |\\langle f | e\\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = e^2 (|\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2)$\n\nLet's evaluate the rates for the first transition: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and $|f\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Initial State:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric.\n*   **Final States:** The final states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields).\n\nA key principle of quantum mechanics (related to the Wigner-Eckart theorem) states that for a transition from a spherically symmetric state ($l=0$) to a set of degenerate states, the transition rate to each of these final states is equal. This is because there is no preferred direction in space for the spherically symmetric initial state.\n\nTherefore, the rates must be equal:\n$\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle)$\n\nLet's call this common rate $\\Gamma_0$. The total transition rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ manifold is the sum of the individual rates:\n$\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n\nThe probability (branching ratio) for the atom to decay into a specific intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n$P(\\text{route via } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle)}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSimilarly, the probability for the route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is also $1/3$, and the probability for the route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is also $1/3$.\n\n### Step 6: Compare with the Given Options\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    This option presents a valid route and the calculated probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our analysis perfectly.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only option that is consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics for dipole transitions is option A. The specific route is allowed by the selection rules, and the probability of this specific channel, among the three equally likely channels, is exactly $1/3$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nThe problem asks for the specific pathway and the corresponding probability for a hydrogen atom to decay from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through a cascade of two electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n**2. Recall the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\nFor an E1 transition between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$, the following selection rules for the quantum numbers must be obeyed:\n*   **Parity change:** The parity of the state must change. This is equivalent to $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Angular momentum projection:** The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Principal quantum number:** There is no selection rule for $\\Delta n = n' - n$, but for spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, which means $n' < n$.\n\n**3. Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = m'$. So, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n    *   $n' < 3$. A common decay path involves the lowest possible change in $n$, so the intermediate state is likely to have $n'=2$. The problem options confirm this by proposing intermediate states with $n=2$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**4. Analyze the Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state (intermediate):** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ where $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n*   **Final state:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the selection rules for each possible intermediate state:\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$.\n        *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. Allowed.\n        *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. Allowed.\n        *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = +1$. Allowed.\n*   Conclusion: All three paths are allowed by the selection rules.\n    *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**5. Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\nThe probability of a specific decay channel depends on the square of the transition matrix element $|\\langle \\text{final} | -e\\vec{r} | \\text{initial} \\rangle|^2$. For a given change in $n$ and $l$ (e.g., $3s \\rightarrow 2p$), the radial part of this integral is the same for all $m'$ states. The branching ratio into the different $m'$ states is determined by the angular part of the integral.\n\nThe initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$. The angular part of its wavefunction is $Y_0^0$, which is spherically symmetric (a constant). Due to this symmetry, the atom has no preferred direction of emission. When averaged over all possible emission directions and polarizations, the decay probability is distributed equally among the available final $m'$ states.\n\nLet's confirm this with the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The transition rate from $|nlm\\rangle$ to $|n'l'm'\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: $|\\langle l,m; 1,q | l',m' \\rangle|^2$, where $q = m'-m$.\nFor the first transition, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n*   $l=0, m=0$. $l'=1, m'=m'$. So $q=m'$.\n*   We need the coefficients $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$.\n*   When coupling any angular momentum $j_2$ to $j_1=0$, the resulting angular momentum is $j=j_2$ and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle 0,0; j_2,m_2 | j_2,m_2 \\rangle$ are always 1.\n*   This means the angular factors are the same for $m'=0, 1, -1$.\n\nTherefore, the probabilities for decaying into each of the three intermediate states are equal.\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = C$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = C$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = C$\n\nSince these are the only three possibilities for the first step of the cascade (to the n=2 shell), the total probability must be 1. Thus, the branching ratio for each path is $1/3$.\n*   Branching Ratio (via $m'=0$) = $1/3$.\n*   Branching Ratio (via $m'=1$) = $1/3$.\n*   Branching Ratio (via $m'=-1$) = $1/3$.\n\nOnce the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it must decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (it cannot decay to $|2,0,0\\rangle$ as that would violate $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$). Therefore, the probability of the second step is 1.\n\nThe overall probability for a given cascade route is the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n**6. Evaluate the Options**\nWe now check the given options against our findings:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation. The route is valid and the probability is correct.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$. This is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$. This is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$. This is incorrect.\n\nOnly option A presents a physically correct statement.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\nHere's a step-by-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial and final states:**\n    *   Initial state: `|n=3, l=0, m=0⟩` or `|3,0,0⟩`. This is a 3s orbital.\n    *   Final state: `|n=1, l=0, m=0⟩` or `|1,0,0⟩`. This is a 1s orbital.\n\n2.  **Understand the transition process:**\n    *   A direct transition from `|3,0,0⟩` to `|1,0,0⟩` is forbidden by the electric dipole selection rules because the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, `Δl`, would be 0.\n    *   The problem states the decay occurs via *two* dipole transitions, implying a cascade through an intermediate state.\n    *   Let the intermediate state be `|n',l',m'⟩`.\n\n3.  **Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules:**\n    The selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   `Δl = ±1`\n    *   `Δm = 0, ±1`\n\n4.  **Determine the intermediate state:**\n    *   **First transition (`|3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩`):**\n        *   The initial state has `l=0`. To satisfy `Δl = ±1`, the intermediate state must have `l'=1`.\n        *   The problem specifies the route goes via `n=2` states, so `n'=2`.\n        *   The initial state has `m=0`. To satisfy `Δm = 0, ±1`, the intermediate state can have `m' = 0, +1,` or `-1`.\n        *   Thus, the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,0⟩`, `|2,1,1⟩`, and `|2,1,-1⟩`.\n    *   **Second transition (`|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`):**\n        *   The final state has `l=0`. The intermediate state has `l'=1`. So, `Δl = 0 - 1 = -1`, which is allowed.\n        *   The final state has `m=0`. The intermediate state has `m'`. So, `Δm = 0 - m'`. Since `m'` can be `0, ±1`, `Δm` can be `0, ∓1`, all of which are allowed.\n    *   Therefore, all three cascade routes are possible:\n        *   `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n        *   `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n        *   `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n    This confirms that the routes listed in options A, C, and D are valid.\n\n5.  **Calculate the probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    *   The probability of a particular cascade route depends on the branching ratio of the first transition, `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩`, since the second transition, `|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`, is the only allowed decay channel from the 2p state (its probability is essentially 1).\n    *   The rate of spontaneous emission for a transition from an initial state `|i⟩` to a final state `|f⟩` is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, `|<f|**r**|i>|²`.\n    *   We need to compare the transition rates from the initial `|3,0,0⟩` state to the three possible intermediate states `|2,1,0⟩`, `|2,1,1⟩`, and `|2,1,-1⟩`.\n    *   The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` is spherically symmetric. The dipole interaction, responsible for the transition, does not have a preferred direction in the absence of external fields. Due to this rotational symmetry, the probability of decaying into any of the magnetic sublevels `m' = -1, 0, +1` of the `l'=1` state must be equal.\n    *   Therefore, the total probability of transitioning from `|3,0,0⟩` to the `|2,1,m'⟩` manifold is split equally among the three `m'` states.\n    *   Total probability = P(m'=-1) + P(m'=0) + P(m'=1) = 1\n    *   Since P(m'=-1) = P(m'=0) = P(m'=1), each probability must be `1/3`.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   A) Path: `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩`. The probability is `1/3`. This matches our calculation.\n    *   B) Path: `|...⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩`. The probability is `2/3`. This is incorrect.\n    *   C) Path: `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩`. The probability is `1/4`. This is incorrect.\n    *   D) Path: `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩`. The probability is `1/4`. This is incorrect.\n\nBased on the principles of quantum mechanics and electric dipole selection rules, the only correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nTo determine the correct transition route and its probability for the decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions, we must apply the selection rules for electric dipole transitions and calculate the branching ratios.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the possible transitions based on selection rules\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   Change in the principal quantum number, n: no restriction, but for decay, Δn < 0.\n*   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, l: Δl = ±1.\n*   Change in the magnetic quantum number, m: Δm = 0, ±1.\n\n**First Transition: |3,0,0> → Intermediate State |n',l',m'>**\n\n*   The initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0>.\n*   According to the Δl = ±1 rule, since l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n*   Since the decay must occur in two steps to reach n=1, and the principal quantum number must decrease, the intermediate state must have n'=2. Decay to n=1 with l=1 is impossible, as n=1 only allows for l=0.\n*   According to the Δm = 0, ±1 rule, since m=0, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n**Second Transition: Intermediate State |2,1,m'> → Final State |1,0,0>**\n\n*   The initial states are |2,1,m'> and the final state is |1,0,0>.\n*   Let's check the selection rules for each possible intermediate state:\n    *   From |2,1,-1> to |1,0,0>: Δl = 0-1 = -1 (allowed); Δm = 0-(-1) = +1 (allowed). This is a valid transition path.\n    *   From |2,1,0> to |1,0,0>: Δl = 0-1 = -1 (allowed); Δm = 0-0 = 0 (allowed). This is a valid transition path.\n    *   From |2,1,1> to |1,0,0>: Δl = 0-1 = -1 (allowed); Δm = 0-1 = -1 (allowed). This is a valid transition path.\n\nAll three transition routes proposed in options A, B, and C are physically possible.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the probability of each transition route\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition step. The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, the three intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> are degenerate.\n\nThe transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole moment matrix element, |<n',l',m'| **r** |n,l,m>|². For a transition from an unpolarized l=0 state to the three different m' substates of an l=1 level, the transition probabilities are equal. This can be formally shown using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, where the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are found to be equal.\n\nTherefore, the atom in the |3,0,0> state has an equal probability of decaying into any of the three |2,1,m'> states.\n*   Total probability of decaying from |3,0,0> to the l=1 level is 1.\n*   Since there are three equally probable final m' states, the probability for each is:\n    *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n    *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n    *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n\nOnce the atom reaches any of the |2,1,m'> states, it is certain to decay to the |1,0,0> state, as this is the only lower-energy state accessible via an electric dipole transition. Thus, the probability of the second step, P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>), is 1.\n\nThe overall probability for each specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n*   Route via |2,1,-1>: P = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n*   Route via |2,1,0>: P = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n*   Route via |2,1,1>: P = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n\n### Step 3: Compare with the given options\n\n*   A) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}  -> Incorrect probability.\n*   B) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{3}  -> **Correct route and probability.**\n*   C) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}  -> Incorrect probability.\n*   D) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{2}{3}  -> Incorrect probability.\n\nThus, option B correctly identifies a possible route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nMy initial reasoning appears correct and is confirmed by the search results.\n\n1.  **Selection Rules**: The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are consistently stated as Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.\n\n2.  **Decay Path**:\n    *   The initial state is |3,0,0>. For the first transition, since l=0, the selection rule Δl = ±1 requires that the intermediate state must have l'=1.\n    *   The problem specifies a two-step decay via the n=2 level. Therefore, the intermediate states must be of the form |2,1,m'>.\n    *   The selection rule Δm = 0, ±1 allows the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate state, m', to be 0, +1, or -1.\n    *   For the second transition from the intermediate state |2,1,m'> to the final state |1,0,0>, the rules are also satisfied: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 and Δm = 0 - m' (which is 0, -1, or +1 for m' = 0, 1, -1 respectively).\n    *   Therefore, all three routes, via |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>, are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n3.  **Probability/Branching Ratio**:\n    *   The key is to determine the probability of entering each of these three allowed channels from the initial |3,0,0> state.\n    *   The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the first photon.\n    *   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment matrix element, `<n',l',m'| **r** |n,l,m>`.\n    *   As confirmed by a source discussing this exact problem, applying the Wigner-Eckart theorem shows that the magnitude of the matrix element for the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m'> is independent of m'. Specifically, the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficients `<l=0, m=0; 1, q | l'=1, m'>` are all equal to 1 for the allowed transitions (where q=m').\n    *   Since the transition rates to the m'=-1, m'=0, and m'=+1 sublevels are equal, and these are the only possibilities for the first step of the decay cascade to n=2, they must be equally probable.\n    *   Once the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'> states (the 2p level), it can only decay to the |1,0,0> ground state via a single photon emission. Thus, the probability of the second step in the cascade is 1.\n    *   Therefore, the overall probability for any one of the specific three decay routes is determined entirely by the branching ratio of the first step, which is 1/3.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The decay route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> has a probability of 1/3. This matches option A. The other options list incorrect probabilities.\n\nFinal Check:\n*   Route A: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> -> Probability = 1/3. Correct.\n*   Route B: Missing initial state but probability of 2/3 is incorrect.\n*   Route C: |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> -> Probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n*   Route D: |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> -> Probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only correct choice.\n\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state cannot happen via a single dipole transition because this would violate the selection rule for the orbital angular momentum quantum number, l (Δl = 0, but the rule is Δl = ±1). The decay must therefore proceed via an intermediate state in a two-step cascade.\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   Δl = ±1\n*   Δm = 0, ±1\n\n**Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state |n',l',m'⟩**\n\nThe problem specifies that the decay route involves an intermediate state with principal quantum number n=2.\n*   Initial state: |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0)\n*   Applying Δl = ±1: Since l=0, the intermediate state must have l'=1.\n*   Applying Δm = 0, ±1: The magnetic quantum number of the intermediate state, m', can be -1, 0, or +1.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state |2,l',m'⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩**\n\nLet's check if transitions from the possible intermediate states to the final state |1,0,0⟩ are allowed:\n*   Intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩ (n'=2, l'=1)\n*   Final state: |1,0,0⟩ (n''=1, l''=0, m''=0)\n*   Check Δl: l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies Δl = ±1.\n*   Check Δm: m'' - m' = 0 - m'. This can be 0, -1, or +1 depending on whether m' is 0, 1, or -1. This satisfies Δm = 0, ±1.\n\nTherefore, all three pathways are allowed by the selection rules:\n1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the probability**\n\nThe probability of a specific decay route depends on the branching ratio of the first transition. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric. In the absence of an external field, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the probabilities of transitioning to each of the three possible m' sub-levels (m' = -1, 0, +1) are equal.\n\nSince there are three equally likely channels for the first step of the decay, the probability for any single channel is 1/3.\n\nThe second step of the decay, from any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states to the |1,0,0⟩ state, is the only possible radiative decay from the 2p level. Therefore, the probability of this transition, given that the atom is in the |2,1,m'⟩ state, is 1.\n\nThe total probability for a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route via the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩:\nP = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3. This matches our calculation.\n*   B) ...→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n*   D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state |n, l, m⟩ = |3, 0, 0⟩ to the final state |1, 0, 0⟩ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n    The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n    *   Δn is not restricted, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), energy must be released, so n must decrease.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State**\n    Let the intermediate state be |n', l', m'⟩.\n    *   **First Transition: |3, 0, 0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩**\n        *   Initial state has l=0. To satisfy Δl=±1, the intermediate state must have l'=1.\n        *   Initial state has m=0. To satisfy Δm=0,±1, the intermediate state can have m' = -1, 0, or +1.\n        *   The principal quantum number n must decrease from n=3. The options provided suggest the intermediate state has n'=2, which is a valid decay path (3s → 2p).\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2, 1, -1⟩, |2, 1, 0⟩, and |2, 1, 1⟩.\n\n    *   **Second Transition: |n', l', m'⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩**\n        *   Let's check if a transition from our potential intermediate states |2, 1, m'⟩ to the final state |1, 0, 0⟩ is allowed.\n        *   The intermediate state has l'=1, and the final state has l_f=0. So, Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is an allowed transition.\n        *   The intermediate state can have m' = -1, 0, or +1, and the final state has m_f=0. So, Δm = 0 - m'. This is -1, 0, or +1 for m'=1, 0, -1 respectively. All are allowed.\n        *   Thus, all three routes proposed in the options (A, B, and D) are valid cascade paths according to the selection rules.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n    The \"probability\" of a specific transition route refers to its branching ratio: the fraction of atoms starting in |3,0,0⟩ that will follow that specific path to reach |1,0,0⟩. This is the product of the branching ratios of the two sequential steps.\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 1: P(|3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, m'⟩)**\n        *   The initial state |3, 0, 0⟩ (a 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric (l=0). The decay process is governed by the interaction Hamiltonian, which, when averaged over all possible emission directions and polarizations of the photon, shows no preference for the final magnetic quantum number m'.\n        *   A more formal argument using the Wigner-Eckart theorem shows that the transition rates Γ(|3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, m'⟩) are identical for all three possible values of m' (-1, 0, 1).\n        *   Since there are three equally probable final states for this decay step, the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them.\n        *   Therefore, the branching ratio for transitioning to any specific m' state is 1/3.\n            *   P(|3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, -1⟩) = 1/3\n            *   P(|3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 0⟩) = 1/3\n            *   P(|3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 1⟩) = 1/3\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 2: P(|2, 1, m'⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩)**\n        *   Now consider an atom in one of the intermediate states, |2, 1, m'⟩ (a 2p orbital). We need to find its decay channels.\n        *   For a dipole transition, n must decrease. The only possibility is n_final = 1.\n        *   For n=1, the only possible value for orbital angular momentum is l=0.\n        *   The transition l'=1 to l_f=0 is allowed (Δl = -1).\n        *   Therefore, the *only* state to which |2, 1, m'⟩ can decay via a single-photon electric dipole transition is the |1, 0, 0⟩ state.\n        *   Since this is the only possible decay channel, it occurs with a probability of 1. The branching ratio for this step is 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability**\n        *   The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n        *   Let's take the route specified in option D: |3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 0⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩.\n        *   Total Probability = P(|3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 0⟩) × P(|2, 1, 0⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩)\n        *   Total Probability = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   A) Route is valid, but probability 1/4 is incorrect. The correct probability is 1/3.\n    *   B) Route is valid, but probability 1/4 is incorrect. The correct probability is 1/3.\n    *   C) The route is likely a typo for |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩, but the probability 2/3 is incorrect.\n    *   D) The route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ is valid, and the calculated probability is 1/3. This matches the option.\n\nFinal conclusion is that option D presents a valid decay path with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ (also known as the 3s state) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state).

This means it's a cascade process involving an intermediate state.\n\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{dipole 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{dipole 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:**\n    The selection rules for an E1 transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n    *   $\\Delta n = n' - n$: can be any integer (but for decay, energy must decrease, so $n'<n$).\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Initial state has $l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Applying the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l' = l \\pm 1 = 0 \\pm 1 = 1$.\n        *   For decay, we must have $n' < 3$. The possible values are $n'=2$ or $n'=1$. However, for $n'=1$, only $l'=0$ is allowed. So, an intermediate state with $n'=1, l'=1$ does not exist.\n        *   Therefore, the only possible principal quantum number for the intermediate state is $n'=2$.\n        *   The intermediate states must belong to the $n=2, l=1$ subshell (the 2p subshell).\n        *   Applying the selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the possible values for $m'$ are $m' = m \\pm 1 = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle,$ and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check if transitions from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ are allowed.\n        *   Initial state: $l'=1$. Final state: $l_f=0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   Initial state: $m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$. Final state: $m_f=0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0 - m' = -m'$. For all three possible values of $m'$, $\\Delta m$ is $0$ or $\\pm 1$, which satisfies the selection rule.\n        *   Thus, all three states $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle,$ and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ can decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The options correctly identify these states as potential intermediate steps.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The problem asks for the probability of a specific route, for example, the one through $|2,1,0\\rangle$. This is the probability of the first step occurring, multiplied by the probability of the second step.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle)$\n        *   The atom starts in a single, non-degenerate, spherically symmetric state $|3,0,0\\rangle$. It can decay into three possible states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle,$ or $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n        *   The transition rate $\\Gamma$ is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator, $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n        *   For an unpolarized initial state (which $|l=0, m=0\\rangle$ intrinsically is, due to its spherical symmetry), the total decay rate to each of the magnetic sublevels of a given final ($n',l'$) will be equal. This is a consequence of the Wigner-Eckart theorem and the rotational symmetry of the system.\n        *   Let's denote the transition rates:\n            *   $\\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle)$\n            *   $\\Gamma_2 = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle)$\n            *   $\\Gamma_3 = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n        *   Due to symmetry, $\\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma_2 = \\Gamma_3$.\n        *   The total decay rate of the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is $\\Gamma_{tot} = \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_2 + \\Gamma_3 = 3\\Gamma_2$.\n        *   The probability (or branching ratio) of the decay proceeding via the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ channel is the ratio of the partial rate to the total rate:\n            $P_1 = \\frac{\\Gamma_2}{\\Gamma_{tot}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_2}{3\\Gamma_2} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n        *   So, the probability of the first step being $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Similarly, the probability of going to $|2,1,1\\rangle$ or $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is also $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** $P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n        *   Once the atom is in the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state, we must find its possible decay channels.\n        *   The selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ means the final state must have $l=0$ or $l=2$.\n        *   For decay, the final state must have lower energy, so $n$ must be less than 2. The only possibility is $n=1$.\n        *   The only state with $n=1$ is $|1,0,0\\rangle$, which has $l=0$. This is an allowed transition.\n        *   There are no states with $n<2$ and $l=2$.\n        *   Therefore, the *only* possible electric dipole decay for the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.\n        *   This means the probability of this second step, given the atom is in the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state, is 1.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Overall Probability:**\n    The total probability of the cascade $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the probabilities of each independent step:\n    $P_{total} = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, Probability $\\frac{1}{4}$.

(Correct route and probability)\n\nTherefore, the correct transition route and corresponding probability are given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** We are asked to analyze the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The problem states this occurs via two successive \"dipole transitions\". This means we are looking for a cascade decay process: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. We need to identify a valid intermediate state and the probability of that specific decay path.\n\n2.  **Recall Dipole Selection Rules:** Electric dipole (E1) transitions are the most common type of radiative transitions and are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers $(n, l, m)$:\n    *   The orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$ must change by one: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number $m$ must change by 0 or 1: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   The principal quantum number $n$ is not restricted by a rule, but for a spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy, which means $n$ must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n3.  **Step 1: Find the Intermediate State:** Let's apply the selection rules to the first transition, from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **Initial State:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$**: Since the initial $l=0$, the intermediate state's orbital quantum number $l'$ must be $l' = 0 \\pm 1 = 1$. (It cannot be -1 as $l$ must be non-negative).\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$**: Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state's magnetic quantum number $m'$ can be $m' = 0 + (0, \\pm 1)$. Thus, $m'$ can be $0$, $+1$, or $-1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$**: The principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n4.  **Step 2: Check the Transition from the Intermediate State to the Final State:** Now, we check if a transition from our potential intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n    *   **Intermediate State candidates:** $|n'<3, l'=1, m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}\\rangle$.\n    *   **Final State:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   **Check $\\Delta l$**: The change in $l$ would be $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is a valid change according to the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   **Check $\\Delta n$**: The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' > n_f = 1$.\n    *   **Combine conditions for n'**: From Step 1 we have $n'<3$, and from Step 2 we have $n'>1$. The only integer value for $n'$ that satisfies both conditions is $n'=2$.\n\n5.  **Identify Possible Decay Routes:** Based on our analysis, the intermediate state must belong to the $n=2, l=1$ subshell (the 2p subshell). There are three such states, corresponding to the possible values of $m'$. This gives us three valid decay paths:\n    *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    All the routes proposed in the options A, B, C, and D are physically possible. The final determination rests on the probability.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):** The probability of a given route is the branching ratio of the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle$). The second transition, from any 2p state to the 1s state, has a probability of 1 since it's the only available dipole decay channel.\n    The key insight is that the initial state, $|3,0,0\\rangle$, is an s-state. S-states are spherically symmetric, meaning they have no preferred direction in space. The three possible intermediate states ($|2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$) are degenerate in energy and only differ by their orientation in space (as defined by the magnetic quantum number $m'$). Since the initial state is symmetric, there is no physical reason for it to prefer decaying into one orientation over another. Therefore, the probability of decaying into each of the three available intermediate states must be equal.\n\n    *   Total number of available, equally likely decay channels for the first step = 3.\n    *   Total probability must be 1.\n    *   Probability for any single channel = $\\frac{\\text{Total Probability}}{\\text{Number of Channels}} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThus, option B is the only one that provides a valid decay route with the correct probability.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nAn analysis of the two-dipole transition from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ in a hydrogen atom involves applying the electric dipole (E1) selection rules and calculating the corresponding branching ratios for the decay cascade.\n\n**1. Identify the Transition Path**\n\nThe decay occurs in two steps, involving an intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. We apply the E1 selection rules for each step:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for decay (emission), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**Step 1: Decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   The selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ means the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   The principal quantum number must decrease, $n'<3$. A direct transition to $n'=1$ is not possible, as for $n'=1$, only $l'=0$ is allowed, which would violate $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. Thus, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n*   The selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ means that from $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Decay from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Let's check if the transition from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   Initial state: $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. Final state: $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$ (allowed).\n*   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (allowed).\n*   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This is allowed if $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$, which is true for all our possible intermediate states.\n*   So, any of the paths $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ for $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$ are valid transition routes. All options A, B, and C propose valid routes.\n\n**2. Calculate the Transition Probability**\n\nThe \"probability\" in this context refers to the branching ratio of a specific cascade path. This is the product of the branching ratios for each step.\n\n**Probability of Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n*   The transition rate $\\Gamma$ is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element.\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0, m=0$). When such a state decays, the transition rates to each of the magnetic sublevels $m'$ of the final state (with a specific $l'$) are equal, assuming we average over all emission directions and polarizations. This is a consequence of the Wigner-Eckart theorem and rotational symmetry.\n*   Let $\\Gamma_{m'} = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$. Then $\\Gamma_0 = \\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma_{-1}$.\n*   The total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of the rates to all possible final states:\n    $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_{-1} = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n*   The branching ratio (probability) for the atom to follow the specific path to the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state is:\n    $P(\\text{Step 1 to } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   Similarly, the probability to transition to $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is 1/3, and to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is also 1/3.\n\n**Probability of Step 2: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Once the atom is in an excited state like $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it will decay to a lower energy state.\n*   The only state with energy lower than $n=2$ is the $n=1$ ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   As we established, the dipole transition $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   Since this is the only possible decay channel via an electric dipole transition from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the probability of this second step occurring is 1 (i.e., the branching ratio is 100%).\n\n**Total Probability of the Cascade**\nThe probability of the entire cascade is the product of the probabilities of each independent step. Let's evaluate the path given in option A:\n*   Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Probability = $P(\\text{Step 1 to } |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(\\text{Step 2 from } |2,1,0\\rangle)$\n*   Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Comparing with the Options**\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This matches our calculation exactly.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The path is valid, but our calculated probability is 1/3, not 1/4.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The path is valid, but our calculated probability is 1/3, not 1/4.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The path is correct, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only choice that provides both a correct transition route and the correct corresponding probability.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions follows specific quantum mechanical selection rules. A direct transition is forbidden because the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, ∆l, would be zero, which violates the rule that ∆l must be ±1 for a dipole transition. Therefore, the decay must occur through an intermediate state in a two-step process, often called a cascade.\n\n1.  **First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → Intermediate State**\n    *   The initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩ (a 3s orbital).\n    *   According to the selection rule ∆l = ±1, the orbital quantum number *l* must change from 0 to 1. This means the intermediate state must be a *p* orbital (l=1).\n    *   The selection rule for the magnetic quantum number *m* is ∆m = 0, ±1. Since the initial state has m=0, the intermediate state can have m' = -1, 0, or +1.\n    *   The options provided specify the intermediate state has a principal quantum number n=2. Thus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n2.  **Second Transition: Intermediate State → |1,0,0⟩**\n    *   The intermediate state has l=1. The final state |1,0,0⟩ has l=0. The change, ∆l = 0 - 1 = -1, is allowed by the selection rules.\n    *   For the magnetic quantum number, the final state has m=0. The transition from the intermediate m' to the final m=0 must satisfy ∆m = 0 - m' = 0, ±1. This condition is met for all possible intermediate states (m' = -1, 0, 1).\n\n**Transition Pathway and Probability**\n\nThe overall process is a cascade from the 3s state to the 1s state through one of the 2p states: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This corresponds to the branching ratio for the first step of the decay.\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of a photon. Consequently, the transitions to the three possible intermediate sublevels (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩) are equally likely. The total probability of transitioning from the |3,0,0⟩ state to any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states is the sum of the probabilities for each path. Since the three paths are equally probable, each must have a probability of 1/3 of the total 3s → 2p transition probability.\n\nSince the only allowed downward decay from the 3s state is to a 2p state, this branching ratio of 1/3 represents the probability of the entire cascade following that specific intermediate channel.\n\nTherefore, the probability for the transition route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is 1/3. The same probability of 1/3 applies to the routes via |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\nBased on the provided options:\n\n*   A) Incorrect probability.\n*   B) Incorrect probability and incomplete initial state notation.\n*   C) Incorrect probability.\n*   D) Correctly identifies a valid route and the corresponding probability.\n\nThe correct route and probability are:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the principles of quantum mechanics that govern the decay of an electron in a hydrogen atom, specifically the selection rules for electric dipole transitions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules\nThe electron is transitioning from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via a two-step process. The states are described in the standard $|n,l,m\\rangle$ notation, where:\n*   $n$ is the principal quantum number (energy level).\n*   $l$ is the azimuthal or orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n*   $m$ is the magnetic quantum number.\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n$, can be any integer. For decay, $\\Delta n$ must be negative.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Allowed Intermediate State(s)\nThe transition occurs in two steps, so there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n**First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' = 0, 1, \\text{or} -1$.\n    *   Since this is a decay cascade, the intermediate state must have a lower principal quantum number than the initial state, so $n' < 3$. The options provided suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$.\n\nThis leads to three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Final state:** $n=1, l=0, m=0$.\n*   We check if a transition from our possible intermediate states to the final state is allowed:\n    *   For any of the intermediate states ($|2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$), we have $l'=1$. The final state has $l=0$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed change.\n    *   The change in $m$ must also satisfy the rules. For each intermediate state:\n        *   $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$. (Allowed)\n        *   $|2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - 1 = -1$. (Allowed)\n        *   $|2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$. (Allowed)\n\nThus, all three paths are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Probability of Each Path\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the probability of the atom decaying into any of the three degenerate intermediate p-states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$) is equal.\n\nThe total probability of transitioning from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to any of the allowed $l=1$ states must be 1 (if we only consider these decay channels). Since there are three equally probable intermediate states, the probability of the atom taking any specific path is:\n\n$P(\\text{path}) = \\frac{1}{\\text{Number of equally probable paths}} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSo, the probabilities for the first step are:\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\nOnce the atom is in an intermediate state, it will proceed to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The question asks for the transition route and its corresponding probability. This refers to the probability of the specified sequence of events occurring.

Understanding Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nIn the non-relativistic theory of the hydrogen atom, transitions between states are governed by selection rules. For an electric dipole transition, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, can be $0, \\pm 1$.\n*   There is no selection rule for the principal quantum number, $n$, but for spontaneous decay, the atom must transition to a state of lower energy ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Transition Cascade\n\nThe process involves a two-step decay from $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 1: Decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n*   **Applying Selection Rules:**\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$. The initial state is an *s*-orbital, so it must transition to a *p*-orbital.\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   $n' < 3$. For a two-step cascade to the $n=1$ state, the most probable intermediate state is one with $n=2$.\n*   **Intermediate States:** Based on the rules, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Decay from the intermediate state to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=1, l=0, m=0$).\n*   Let's check the validity of the transition from the possible intermediate states:\n    *   **From $|2,1,m'\\rangle$:**\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{intermediate} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m'$. For this to be allowed, $m'$ must be one of the values that makes $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. This condition holds for all three possibilities: $m'=0 (\\Delta m=0)$, $m'=1 (\\Delta m=-1)$, and $m'=-1 (\\Delta m=+1)$.\n*   Therefore, all three proposed cascades are physically possible:\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe question asks for the probability corresponding to a *specific* transition route. We need to find the branching ratio for the first step of the cascade.\n\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0, m=0$). In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   Because of this symmetry, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state. This can be formally shown using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, where the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ are found to be equal for $m'=-1, 0, 1$.\n*   Thus, the total probability of 1 is split equally among the three possible decay channels for the first step.\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n*   For the second step, the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level) have only one allowed electric dipole decay channel, which is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s ground state). The transition to the 2s state ($|2,0,0\\rangle$) is forbidden by the parity selection rule ($\\Delta l = -1$ is required, but s to p is allowed, however, p to s is parity changing). Therefore, the probability of the transition from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is 1 (or 100%).\n\n*   The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route specified in options A and D:\n    $P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    $P_{total} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct transition route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and the probability of this specific path occurring is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches option D.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "To determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis based on the principles of quantum mechanics is required.\n\n### 1. Identify the Process and Selection Rules\n\nThe problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition, which must obey the following selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For spontaneous emission (decay), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determine the Possible Transition Routes\n\nThe decay occurs in a cascade through an intermediate state:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**First Transition: From $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial State:** $|n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n*   **Change in *l*:** Since the initial $l=0$, the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n*   **Change in *n*:** The energy must decrease ($n'<3$) but allow for a subsequent decay to $n=1$. This implies the intermediate state cannot have $n'=1$ (as that would be the final step and wouldn't have $l'=1$). Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n*   **Change in *m*:** Since the initial $m=0$, the selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Possible Intermediate States:** The allowed intermediate states are thus $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: From the intermediate state to $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Intermediate State:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. Final State: $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Change in *l*:** The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n*   **Change in *m*:** The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This is also allowed for all three possible intermediate values of $m'$ ($-1, 0, 1$).\n\nThis confirms that all three routes via the intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are physically possible.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** This is the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to a *specific* intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an *s*-state, which is spherically symmetric.\n    *   Due to this symmetry and the isotropic nature of spontaneous emission (in the absence of external fields), there is no preference for the decay to populate one magnetic sublevel over another.\n    *   The transition rates to the three degenerate intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) are identical.\n    *   Since there are three equally probable channels, and they are the only ones for the $3s \\rightarrow 2p$ transition, the total probability is divided equally among them.\n*   **Conclusion:** The probability for the atom to take any one specific route is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Options\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This option presents a valid route and the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: This is a valid route, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: This is a valid route, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: This route is valid (despite the typo), but the probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that correctly identifies a valid decay path and its associated probability.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Understanding the Transition Process**\n\nThe problem describes a cascade decay from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s state) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s state) through an intermediate state via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n**2. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\n\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n$, can be any integer.\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n\n**3. First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\nLet's apply the selection rules to the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$:\n*   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since $l=0$, the only possibility is $l' = l+1 = 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since $m=0$, the possible values for $m'$ are $m' = m + \\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n$:** For a decay process (emission of a photon), the energy of the atom must decrease, so the principal quantum number must decrease, i.e., $n' < 3$. The possible values are $n'=2$ or $n'=1$. However, for $n'=1$, the only possible value for $l'$ is $l'=0$. This contradicts the requirement that $l'=1$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n\nCombining these results, the possible intermediate states are:\n$|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. These correspond to the three degenerate $2p$ orbitals.\n\n**4. Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\nNow, let's check if a transition from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   **Intermediate state:** $n'=2, l'=1, m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n*   **Final state:** $n_{f}=1, l_{f}=0, m_{f}=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$.\n    *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$ (allowed).\n    *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$ (allowed).\n    *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = 1$ (allowed).\n\nSo, all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The possible transition routes are:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll routes listed in the options are physically possible. We now need to determine the probability.\n\n**5. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n*   **Step 1: Branching Ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (an s-orbital). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the probability of decaying into any of the three degenerate $2p$ states ($|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$) must be equal. Since these are the only allowed E1 decay channels (we assume decay to higher $p$ states is negligible, which is standard), the total probability of decaying to the $2p$ level is 1. The probability is distributed equally among the three possible final states.\n    \n    Branching Ratio ($BR_1$) for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$ for each $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n\n*   **Step 2: Branching Ratio for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    Once the atom is in one of the $2p$ states (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$), it will decay to a lower energy state. The only state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the $1s$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$). Decay to the $2s$ state is forbidden by the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. Therefore, any atom that reaches a $2p$ state is certain to decay to the $1s$ state.\n    \n    Branching Ratio ($BR_2$) for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability for a specific route**\n    The total probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is:\n    $P = BR_1 \\times BR_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is a valid path, and its probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$.

These rules dictate how the quantum numbers *n*, *l*, and *m* can change during a transition.\n\n### 1. Dipole Selection Rules\n\nFor an electric dipole transition, the selection rules are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\nThe principal quantum number *n* must decrease for a decay (emission of a photon). The question specifies a two-step transition, implying the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Change in *l***: Since the initial orbital quantum number *l* is 0, the only possible change is $\\Delta l = +1$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Change in *m***: The initial magnetic quantum number *m* is 0. The selection rule allows $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, so the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n*   **Change in *n***: The transition must be to a lower energy level, so $n' < 3$. A decay to the $n'=2$ level is a common pathway.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n*   **Final State:** $|n'',l'',m''\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Change in *l***: The intermediate state has $l'=1$ and the final state has $l''=0$. The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed by the selection rules.\n*   **Change in *m***: The final state has $m''=0$. The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. Since the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, the possible changes are $\\Delta m \\in \\{+1, 0, -1\\}$, all of which are allowed.\n\nAll three potential pathways are valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 4. Transition Probabilities\n\nThe probability of a specific decay path depends on the transition rates, which are proportional to the square of the matrix elements of the electric dipole operator. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, it can be shown that the angular part of the transition probability is determined by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):** The transition rates are found to be equal for all three possible intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n*   **For the second transition ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):** Similarly, the transition rates from each of the three intermediate states to the final ground state are also equal.\n\nSince the probabilities for each of the three possible cascade routes are equal, and they are the only routes for this two-dipole transition process via the n=2 shell, the total probability is distributed evenly among them. Therefore, the probability of any single specific route is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n\nOption A correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe user wants me to solve a quantum mechanics problem about the decay of a hydrogen atom state and provide the answer as Python code.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics:**\n    *   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.

Understand the Process**\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs not in a single step, but via a two-step process involving two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. The overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**2. Apply Dipole Transition Selection Rules**\nFor an electric dipole transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer. Since this is a decay process (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State(s)**\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the transition.\n\n*   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   Initial state: $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta n = n' - n_i = n' - 3 < 0$, so $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **Second transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Final state: $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - l' = \\pm 1$. This requires $l'=1$, which is consistent with the first transition.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This requires $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which is also consistent.\n    *   $\\Delta n = n_f - n' = 1 - n' < 0$, so $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions for the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n    *   From the first step: $n'<3$, $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   From the second step: $n'>1$, $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The only integer value for $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$ is $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\nThis means there are three possible routes for the two-step decay:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This probability is the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the probability that the atom, starting in $|3,0,0\\rangle$, will decay into a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe probability of a transition to a specific state is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle \\text{final} | \\vec{d} | \\text{initial} \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d} = -e\\vec{r}$ is the electric dipole operator. The transition rate is proportional to $|\\langle n',l',m' | \\vec{r} | n,l,m \\rangle|^2$.\n\nWe need to find the relative rates for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states:\n*   Rate to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: $W_{-1} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,-1 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n*   Rate to $|2,1,0\\rangle$: $W_{0} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,0 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n*   Rate to $|2,1,1\\rangle$: $W_{+1} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,1 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has orbital angular momentum $l=0$, which means its wavefunction is spherically symmetric. When a spherically symmetric system decays, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the decay populates each of the magnetic sublevels ($m'$) of the final state equally.\n\nTherefore, the transition rates to the states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equal:\n$W_{-1} = W_{0} = W_{+1}$\n\nThe total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $n=2, l=1$ level is $W_{total} = W_{-1} + W_{0} + W_{+1} = 3W_{0}$.\n\nThe probability (branching ratio) for the atom to take the path through the intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{W_{0}}{W_{total}} = \\frac{W_{0}}{W_{-1} + W_{0} + W_{+1}} = \\frac{W_{0}}{3W_{0}} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSimilarly, the probabilities for the paths through $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are also both $1/3$.\n\nOnce the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it will decay to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Since this is the only allowed decay channel to the $n=1$ level, the probability of this second step is 1. Thus, the probability of the entire cascade is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n**5. Match with the Options**\nWe are looking for an option that lists a valid route and the correct probability.\n*   A) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability: $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability: $\\frac{1}{4}$.

(Correct route and probability)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process and Selection Rules:**\n    The problem describes a two-step cascade decay from the hydrogen atom state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ (change in orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ (change in magnetic quantum number)\n    *   Parity must change, which is guaranteed by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ since parity is given by $(-1)^l$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Possible Transition Routes:**\n    The decay proceeds from the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$ via an intermediate state $|k\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |k\\rangle$):**\n        *   Initial state: $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n        *   Applying selection rules:\n            *   $\\Delta l = +1$ is required, since $l=0$ cannot decrease. So, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n            *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   The problem implies the intermediate state has the principal quantum number $n'=2$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states $|k\\rangle$ are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition ($|k\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n        *   Initial state: $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Final state: $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check if this transition is allowed for all possible intermediate states:\n            *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n            *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. Since $m'$ can be $0, \\pm 1$, this condition is satisfied for all three intermediate states.\n        *   So, all three paths are possible:\n            *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n            *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n            *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Each Route:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is given by the product of the branching ratios for each step.\n    Probability(route) = BranchingRatio(step 1) $\\times$ BranchingRatio(step 2).\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the First Step:**\n        The branching ratio for the transition to a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is the ratio of the partial decay rate to that state to the total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$.\n        The transition rate $\\Gamma_{i \\to k}$ is proportional to the square of the matrix element $|\\langle k | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n        We need to compare the rates $\\Gamma_{300 \\to 21m'}$ for $m' = -1, 0, 1$.\n\n        A powerful symmetry argument can be used here: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means its wavefunction is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay must be isotropic, meaning the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the magnetic sublevels $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n        This implies that the transition rates are equal:\n        $\\Gamma_{300 \\to 21,-1} = \\Gamma_{300 \\to 21,0} = \\Gamma_{300 \\to 21,1}$.\n\n        Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first step, the branching ratio for each is $1/3$.\n        BranchingRatio($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$) = $1/3$ for each $m'$.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the Second Step:**\n        For the second step, the atom is in one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (a $2p$ state). The only lower-energy state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the $1s$ state). Decay to the $|2,0,0\\rangle$ state is also possible in principle, but the energy difference is tiny (Lamb shift), and the $\\omega^3$ dependence of the transition rate makes the decay to $1s$ overwhelmingly dominant. Therefore, we can assume the decay from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state proceeds to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of 1.\n        BranchingRatio($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$) = 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for any of the three specific routes is:\n        Probability(route) = $(1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Let's examine the given options:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect, probability should be 1/3)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct, both the route and the probability match our calculation)\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect, probability is wrong)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect, probability should be 1/3)\n\nThe only option consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Transitions and Selection Rules\n\nThe problem describes a cascade decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through an intermediate state via two electric dipole transitions. The selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $l=0$ and $m=0$.\n*   **Selection rule for $l$:** Since the initial $l=0$, we must have $\\Delta l = +1$, which means the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Selection rule for $m$:** Since the initial $m=0$, we can have $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. This means the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Intermediate state:** The problem implies the intermediate state has a principal quantum number $n'=2$. Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\nLet's check if the transitions from the possible intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ are allowed.\n*   **Initial state:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$. Here, $l'=1$.\n*   **Final state:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Here, the final angular momentum quantum number is $l_{final}=0$.\n*   **Selection rule for $l$:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n*   **Selection rule for $m$:** The change $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$ must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate states ($m' = 0, \\pm 1$).\n\nAll three routes, via $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe overall probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n**Probability of the First Step: $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$**\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. This means there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the first photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate sub-levels of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state. The total probability of transitioning from the 3s state to the 2p manifold is 1 (as it's the only significant decay channel). Therefore, the probability of populating each specific intermediate state is:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n**Probability of the Second Step: $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$**\n\nOnce the atom is in one of the intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (the 2p orbital), it will decay to a lower energy level. According to the dipole selection rules, a transition from $l=1$ can only go to $l=0$ or $l=2$. Since the only available lower energy level is $n=1$, which has $l=0$, the only possible decay channel is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s orbital). Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1, regardless of the value of $m'$.\n$P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$ for $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n**Total Probability of the Cascade Route**\n\nThe total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n$P(\\text{route via } m') = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n\n*   For the route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$: Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$: Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   For the route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### 3. Compare with the Options\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on our findings:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

The transition route is valid, and the calculated probability is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state to a final state via two dipole transitions is governed by a set of selection rules. These rules dictate which transitions are possible based on the change in the quantum numbers *n*, *l*, and *m*.\n\nThe process in question is a cascade decay from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state. This cannot happen in a single step because the orbital angular momentum quantum number, *l*, would have to remain 0, which violates the dipole selection rule that requires Δ*l* = ±1. Therefore, the decay must proceed through an intermediate state.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩**\n\n*   **Initial State:** |*n*=3, *l*=0, *m*=0⟩.\n*   **Selection Rules for Dipole Transitions:**\n    *   Δ*l* = *l'* - *l* = ±1. Since the initial *l* is 0, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n    *   Δ*m* = *m'* - *m* = 0, ±1. Since the initial *m* is 0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = 0, +1, or -1.\n*   The principal quantum number *n* must decrease, so *n'* < 3. A common intermediate state is *n'*=2.\n\nBased on these rules, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state to the final state |1,0,0⟩**\n\n*   **Final State:** |*n*=1, *l*=0, *m*=0⟩.\n*   Let's check the transitions from the possible intermediate states:\n    *   From |2,1,*m'*⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.\n    *   Δ*l* = *l*<sub>final</sub> - *l'* = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the selection rule for all possible intermediate states.\n    *   Δ*m* = *m*<sub>final</sub> - *m'* = 0 - *m'*. This must be 0 or ±1. This condition is met for *m'* = 0, +1, and -1.\n\nThus, all three decay routes are physically possible:\n1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (*l*=0). This means there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the first photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the allowed magnetic sublevels (*m'*) of the *l'*=1 state.\n\nThe total transition probability is the sum of the probabilities to each of the three intermediate states: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩. Because of the initial state's symmetry, the probabilities for transitioning to each of these three states are equal.\n\nP(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)\n\nSince these are the only three possible paths for the first step of the cascade, the sum of their probabilities must be 1. Therefore, the probability for any single path is 1/3.\n\nThe question asks for the transition route and its corresponding probability. Let's examine the options provided:\n*   **A) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/3:** This route is valid, and the calculated probability for this specific path is 1/3.\n*   **B) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3:** The probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4:** The probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4:** The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe probability of the entire cascade is determined by the probability of the first step, as the second transition (e.g., from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩) is the only allowed dipole decay path to a lower energy level and thus has a probability of 1. Therefore, the probability of the specific cascade |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is 1/3.\n\nThe correct answer is the one that identifies a valid route with the correct probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe problem asks for a valid decay route and its probability for the transition of a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the selection rules for E1 transitions.\nAn electric dipole transition between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is governed by the following selection rules:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  The principal quantum number $n$ can change by any integer value ($\\Delta n = \\text{any integer}$), but for emission, the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible intermediate states.\nThe process is a two-step cascade:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta n < 0$: The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$. For a cascade to the $n=1$ state, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Final state: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   Let's check if our possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ can decay to the final state.\n*   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: The change is $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: The change is $m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate $m'$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n*   So, all three routes are physically possible:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability of each route.\nThe \"probability\" of a specific route is its branching ratio.\n*   **Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the $2p$ subshell), its only allowed E1 decay channel is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the $1s$ state). Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1 for all three routes.\n*   **First Step:** We need to find the relative probabilities of the transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred direction in space.\n    *   The decay process (spontaneous emission), when averaged over all photon emission directions and polarizations, is an isotropic process.\n    *   The three possible final states for this step, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields) and only differ by their spatial orientation (the value of $m'$).\n    *   Because the initial state and the interaction are both isotropic, there can be no preference for producing one orientation ($m'$) over another. Therefore, the three degenerate $m'$ sub-levels must be populated with equal probability.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since there are three equally likely routes, and the total probability must sum to 1, the probability for each specific route is $1/3$.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the given options.\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid route with the correct corresponding probability is C. The Python code execution confirms that the branching ratio for each of the three possible decay paths is indeed $1/3$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means it's a cascade process involving an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an E1 transition to occur, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First Transition:** From $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l' = 1$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule: $n' < 3$.\n        *   The lowest possible energy level with $l=1$ is $n=2$. So, the most probable first transition is to the $n'=2$ level. The options provided in the question confirm that the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** From the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check if this transition is allowed by the selection rules.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate $m'$ values (i.e., for $m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n        *   $\\Delta n = n_{final} - n' = 1 - 2 = -1$. This is an allowed decay.\n\n4.  **Identify Possible Transition Routes:** Based on the analysis above, there are three possible cascade routes from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) for each Route:**\n    The probability of a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The branching ratio is the ratio of the rate of a specific transition to the total transition rate.\n    The transition rate $\\Gamma_{i \\to f}$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    Let's analyze the rate of the first transition: $\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$.\n\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the three degenerate sub-levels $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equally probable.\n\n    To formally verify this, we can use the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The transition rate from $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle l, m; 1, q | l', m' \\rangle|^2$, where $q = m' - m$.\n    For the first transition: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and $|f\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    So, $l=0, m=0$ and $l'=1, m'=m'$. This gives $q = m' - 0 = m'$.\n    The relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is $\\langle 0, 0; 1, m' | 1, m' \\rangle$. For coupling anything with angular momentum 0, this coefficient is always 1.\n    So, $|\\langle 0, 0; 1, m' | 1, m' \\rangle|^2 = 1$ for all three possible values of $m' (-1, 0, 1)$.\n\n    This confirms that the transition rates are equal:\n    $\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,-1) = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,0) = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,1)$.\n\n    The total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. Since the only allowed E1 decay is to the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the total rate is:\n    $\\Gamma_{total} = \\sum_{m'=-1,0,1} \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$.\n    Let $\\Gamma_0 = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$ for any $m'$. Then $\\Gamma_{total} = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n\n    The probability, or branching ratio, for the transition to proceed via a specific intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n    $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,0)}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    Since the rates are equal for all three intermediate $m'$ states, the probability for each of the three routes is $1/3$.\n\n6.  **Consider the Second Transition's Probability:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, it must decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Are there other competing decay channels from $|2,1,m'\\rangle$?\n    According to the selection rules, a state with $l=1$ can decay to a state with $l=0$ or $l=2$.\n    *   $l=0$: The only state with $l=0$ and $n<2$ is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   $l=2$: States with $l=2$ (d-states) only exist for $n \\ge 3$. Since decay requires $n_{final} < n_{initial}$, there are no allowed E1 transitions from $n=2, l=1$ to an $l=2$ state.\n    Therefore, the state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ can only decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an E1 transition. The probability of this second step, given the atom is in the intermediate state, is 1.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The overall probability of a specific cascade route is the probability of the first step (the branching ratio) multiplied by the probability of the second step.\n    Probability = (Branching Ratio of first step) $\\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\n    So, for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, the probability is $1/3$.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    A) Route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, probability is $\\frac{2}{3}$.

This is the 3s state.\n    *   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is the 1s ground state.\n    *   **Process:** The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means it's a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the correct decay path (the intermediate state) and the probability of that specific path.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions:**\n    For an atom to transition from an initial state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$ to a final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle$ by emitting a single photon (E1 transition), the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For emission (decay), the energy must decrease, which means the principal quantum number must decrease, $n_f < n_i$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Possible Intermediate States:**\n    The decay happens in two steps:\n    *   **Step 1:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$ (Intermediate State)\n    *   **Step 2:** $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ (Final State)\n\n    Let's apply the selection rules to Step 1:\n    *   Initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n    *   **Rule for l:** $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l' = 1$.\n    *   **Rule for m:** $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   **Rule for n:** We need $n' < n_i=3$. Also, for any state, we must have $l' \\le n'-1$. Since we found $l'=1$, we need $1 \\le n'-1$, which implies $n' \\ge 2$. Combining $n'<3$ and $n'\\ge2$, the only possible value is $n'=2$.\n\n    So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    Now, let's check if Step 2 is allowed from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   Initial state for Step 2 is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. Final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Rule for l:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   **Rule for m:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. Since $m'$ can be $-1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$, this condition is satisfied for all three possible intermediate states.\n    *   **Rule for n:** $\\Delta n = n_f - n' = 1 - 2 = -1$. This is an allowed decay.\n\n    Conclusion: All three decay paths are possible:\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first decay step. The total transition rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of the rates to all possible intermediate states. The probability of one specific channel is the rate of that channel divided by the total rate.\n\n    $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m''=-1}^{1} \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m''\\rangle)}$\n\n    We can determine the relative probabilities using a powerful symmetry argument:\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. Its wave function is spherically symmetric, meaning it has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   Because the initial state is rotationally invariant, the decay process itself cannot have a preferred direction.\n    *   Therefore, the atom must decay with equal probability into each of the available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate p-state ($l'=1$).\n\n    This means:\n    $P(\\text{to } m'=-1) = P(\\text{to } m'=0) = P(\\text{to } m'=+1)$\n\n    Since these are the only three possible outcomes for the first transition, their probabilities must sum to 1:\n    $P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1$\n    $3 \\times P(\\text{any single } m') = 1$\n    $P(\\text{any single } m') = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n    So, the probability of the decay proceeding through the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state is $\\frac{1}{3}$.

Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules for the first transition:\n        *   $l_{initial} = 0$, so we must have $\\Delta l = +1$, which means $l' = 1$.\n        *   $m_{initial} = 0$, so we can have $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, which means $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n        *   $n_{initial} = 3$, so $n'$ must be less than 3. The most probable transitions are to the next lowest principal quantum number, so we consider $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Second Transition:**\n    The final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's check if a transition from our possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state is allowed.\n    *   Applying the selection rules for the second transition:\n        *   $l_{intermediate} = 1$ and $l_{final} = 0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n        *   $m_{final} = 0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n    *   This confirms that all three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The possible decay routes are:\n        *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    We need to find the probability of the specific route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$. The total probability is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio of the First Step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. Consequently, the decay to the three degenerate p-sublevels ($|2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$) must be equally probable.\n        The total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $n=2, l=1$ level is the sum of the rates to the three sub-levels. Since the rates are equal, the probability (or branching ratio) of decaying into any one specific sub-level, such as $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n        So, the branching ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio of the Second Step ($|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n        Once the atom is in the state $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it needs to decay to a lower energy state. The only available lower energy state is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The transition $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed by the dipole selection rules ($\\Delta l = -1, \\Delta m = 0$). Since this is the only possible decay channel, any atom that reaches the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of 1.\n        So, the branching ratio for $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is $1$.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the individual branching ratios:\n        $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The correct transition route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and the corresponding probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$.

According to the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n*   The orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* must change by ±1 (Δ*l* = ±1).\n*   The magnetic quantum number *m* can change by 0 or ±1 (Δ*m* = 0, ±1).\n*   The principal quantum number *n* is not strictly constrained but must decrease for a decay.\n\nFor the first transition from |3,0,0⟩:\n*   Since the initial *l* is 0, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n*   Since the initial *m* is 0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = -1, 0, or 1.\n*   The problem specifies a cascade through the n=2 shell, so the intermediate state will have *n'* = 2.\n\nThis means the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Second Transition\n\nThe second transition is from the intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. Let's check if this is allowed by the selection rules:\n*   Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1. This is an allowed change.\n*   For the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩, the change in *m* is Δ*m* = 0 - 0 = 0. This is allowed.\n*   For the intermediate state |2,1,1⟩, the change in *m* is Δ*m* = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n*   For the intermediate state |2,1,-1⟩, the change in *m* is Δ*m* = 0 - (-1) = +1. This is allowed.\n\nTherefore, all three potential pathways are valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the decay.\n\nFor the first step, the atom decays from a spherically symmetric state (*l*=0). In such cases, the transition probabilities to each of the possible *m'* states of the next *l* level are equal. Since there are three possible intermediate states (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩), the probability of transitioning to any single one of them is 1/3.\n\nFor the second step, consider the decay from the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩. The atom must decay to a lower energy level, which is the n=1 ground state. The only possible state in the n=1 shell is |1,0,0⟩ (since *l* must be less than *n*). Therefore, the transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ occurs with a probability of 1, as it is the only available decay channel.\n\nThe total probability for the cascade |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n*   P(total) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\n*   P(total) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\nThis matches the path and probability given in option A. The other options list either incorrect probabilities for their respective valid paths or an incorrect probability for the path in option A.\n\nThe correct transition route and probability are:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state occurs via a two-step electric dipole transition, which necessitates passing through an intermediate state. The rules governing these transitions, known as selection rules, dictate how the quantum numbers n, l, and m can change.\n\n### Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state\n\nThe initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩, commonly known as the 3s state. According to the electric dipole selection rules, for a transition to be allowed, the orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* must change by ±1 (Δl = ±1), and the magnetic quantum number *m* can change by 0 or ±1 (Δm = 0, ±1).\n\nApplying these rules to the initial state |3,0,0⟩:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: Since the initial *l* is 0, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: Since the initial *m* is 0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = 0, 1, or -1.\n\nThe principal quantum number *n* must decrease for a decay. The options provided suggest an intermediate state with n=2. Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩. These correspond to the 2p subshell.\n\n### Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩\n\nAll three possible intermediate states |2,1,m'⟩ can transition to the final state |1,0,0⟩, as this step also satisfies the selection rules (Δl = 0-1 = -1, and Δm is 0 or ±1).\n\n### Calculating the Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This corresponds to the branching ratio for the first step of the decay. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (since *l*=0). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the transitions to each of the possible intermediate states |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩ are equally probable.\n\nSince there are three equally likely decay channels from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the n=2, l=1 manifold, and these are the only allowed dipole transitions to the n=2 shell, the probability for each channel is 1/3.\n\nThe probability of the entire cascade is determined by this first step, as the subsequent decay from any |2,1,m'⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩ is the only path available and thus has a probability of 1.\n\nTherefore, the three possible decay routes and their probabilities are:\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/3 (Correct route and probability)\n*   C) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3 (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct choice is the one that presents a valid route with the calculated probability of 1/3.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ is governed by the electric dipole selection rules:\n$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\nThe problem describes a two-step dipole transition from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.

According to the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Change in *n***: For a decay (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. The options provided all suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$, which is the most probable transition ($3s \\rightarrow 2p$).\n*   **Change in *m***: The initial state has $m=0$. The selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' = 0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Change in *l***: The intermediate state has $l'=1$ and the final state has $l=0$. This gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is an allowed transition.\n*   **Change in *m***: The final state has $m=0$. The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. For this to be allowed, $m'$ must be $0, +1,$ or $-1$, which is true for all possible intermediate states.\n\nAll three routes, via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n**Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe probability of a specific decay route is the product of the branching ratios for each step.\n\n1.  **Branching Ratio for the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (an s-orbital). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to transition to any of the allowed magnetic sublevels of the $l'=1$ state. The three possible final states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. The total probability of transitioning to one of these three states is 1 (assuming the $3s \\rightarrow 2p$ transition is the only one considered). Since the probabilities are equal, the branching ratio for transitioning to any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    So, $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n2.  **Branching Ratio for the second step ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    The intermediate state is a $2p$ state. The only state with a lower principal quantum number that it can decay to via a dipole transition is the $1s$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$). Since this is the only possible decay channel for the $2p$ state, the branching ratio for this transition is 1, regardless of the value of $m'$.\n    So, $P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n**Total Probability for the Cascade**\n\nThe total probability for the specific route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n$P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process and Selection Rules:**\n    The problem describes a decay from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via a cascade of two electric dipole (E1) transitions. The process can be written as:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_1} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_2} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta n$: no restriction (but energy must decrease for spontaneous emission).\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n    *   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n        *   The initial state has $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, we get $l' - 0 = \\pm 1$.

So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   For spontaneous emission, the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number must be $n' < 3$.\n    *   **Second transition:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   The final state has $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, we get $l_f - l' = 0 - l' = \\pm 1$. This confirms that the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Since the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ and $n'<3$, the only possibility for $n'$ is $n'=2$ (the state $|n'=1, l'=1\\rangle$ does not exist).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The intermediate state must be one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, where $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.

Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the transition rates to each of the three magnetic sub-levels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state are equal.\n        The transition rate $\\Gamma_{i \\to f}$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$. For a transition from an $l=0$ state to an $l=1$ state, the Wigner-Eckart theorem shows that the transition probability is independent of the final magnetic quantum number $m'$.\n        Since there are three possible final states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$) and they are equally probable, the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them.\n        Therefore, the branching ratio for decaying into any specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n        $Br(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Branching ratio for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        From the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, the atom must decay to a state with lower energy ($n<2$) and satisfying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n        The only possible value for $n$ is $n=1$.\n        For $n=1$, the only possible value for $l$ is $l=0$.\n        Therefore, the only possible E1 decay channel from the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.

Understanding the Transition\nThe problem describes a two-step radiative cascade:\nInitial State: |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩, commonly known as the 3s state.\nFinal State: |n=1, l=0, m=0⟩, the ground state, or 1s state.\n\nThis process involves an intermediate state, |n', l', m'⟩. The decay happens through two successive electric dipole transitions.\n\n### 2. Applying Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for allowed electric dipole transitions are fundamental to determining the path. For a transition to occur, the change in the quantum numbers must satisfy:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly 1.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or 1.\n*   The principal quantum number *n* does not have a strict selection rule but must change (n' < n for decay).\n\n### 3. Determining the Transition Route\n**First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩**\n*   The initial state has l=0. According to the selection rule Δl = ±1, the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n*   The initial state has m=0. The selection rule Δm = 0, ±1 allows the intermediate state to have **m' = 0, +1, or -1**.\n*   The options provided suggest the intermediate state has a principal quantum number **n' = 2**.\n*   Thus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩. These correspond to the 2p subshell.\n\n**Second Transition: |n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n*   The intermediate state has l'=1. The final state has l=0. This satisfies Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is an allowed transition.\n*   The intermediate state has m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}. The final state has m=0. The change Δm = 0 - m' must satisfy |Δm| ≤ 1. This condition is met for all three possible m' values.\n\nTherefore, three possible cascade routes exist:\n1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability\nThe question asks for the probability of a *specific* transition route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first decay step.\n\n*   The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of a photon.\n*   Consequently, the decay probability is distributed equally among all possible final magnetic sublevels (m').\n*   The l'=1 state has (2l'+1) = 3 magnetic sublevels (m' = -1, 0, 1).\n*   Assuming the decay from the 3s state primarily goes to the 2p subshell, the probability of transitioning into any single one of these three states is equal.\n*   Therefore, the branching ratio for the decay into any specific m' state is 1/3.\n\nThe second step of the cascade, from any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, can only go to the |1,0,0⟩ ground state, as it is the only available lower energy level. Thus, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n\nThe total probability for any one of the specific routes is the product of the probabilities of each step:\nP(Route) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩) × P(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n### 5.

The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State (First Transition):**\n    *   The initial state is $|3, 0, 0\\rangle$, which has $l=0$.\n    *   According to the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   According to the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0 - \\Delta m$, so $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n    *   For a cascade decay from $n=3$ to $n=1$, the most probable intermediate state will have $n'=2$.\n    *   Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Check the Second Transition:** The second transition is from an intermediate state $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n    *   For this step, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   The change in magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$, is also allowed for $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Therefore, all three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$. This confirms that the transition routes listed in the options are valid.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):** We need to find the probability of one specific path, for example, $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. This probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **First step probability:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Spontaneous emission from a spherically symmetric state is isotropic, meaning it does not have a preferred direction. Consequently, it populates all allowed final magnetic substates ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) with equal probability. Since there are three such states, the probability (or branching ratio) for transitioning to any single one of them is $1/3$.\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$.\n    *   **Second step probability:** The intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ (a 2p state) will decay to a state with lower energy. The only available state that satisfies the E1 selection rules is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, the probability of this transition occurring is essentially 1 (or 100%).\n        $P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) \\approx 1$.\n    *   **Total Probability:** The total probability for the entire cascade is the product of the probabilities of the individual steps:\n        $P_{total} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ has a probability of $1/3$. The same logic applies to the other two possible routes through $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$; they also each have a probability of $1/3$.

The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. We need to find a valid intermediate state and the probability of that specific decay path. The state is denoted by $|n, l, m\\rangle$, where $n$ is the principal quantum number, $l$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $m$ is the magnetic quantum number.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an atom to transition from an initial state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$ to a final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle$ by emitting a single photon (electric dipole transition), the following selection rules must be obeyed:\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n = n_f - n_i$, can be any integer.\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Transition:**\n    *   Initial state: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. So, $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n    *   Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l' = 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n    *   The options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is an energetically allowed decay, as the energy of the $n=3$ state is higher than the $n=2$ state ($E_n \\propto -1/n^2$).\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Transition:**\n    *   Intermediate state: $|n', l', m'\\rangle = |2, 1, m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Final state: $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. So, $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = -m'$. For this to be allowed, $-m'$ must be in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which means $m'$ must be in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   This confirms that all three potential intermediate states identified in Step 3 can indeed decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an E1 transition.\n    *   Therefore, the possible routes are:\n        *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Transition Probability:** The probability of a specific decay route is the product of the branching ratios for each step.\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the first step:** We need to find the relative probability for the atom in state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to decay into each of the possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. The transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle n'l'm' | e\\vec{r} | nlm \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space for this state.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the available magnetic sublevels of the final state. In this case, the final state has $l'=1$, which has three sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   Therefore, the transition rates to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are all equal.\n    *   Since these are the only three possible states for the first step (in the $n=2$ shell), the probability is distributed equally among them.\n    *   The branching ratio for the transition to any specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is thus $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the second step:** Now consider the decay from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   The only state with a lower principal quantum number that can be reached via an E1 transition is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (since $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$).\n    *   Other decays, like $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,0,0\\rangle$, are possible by selection rules, but the energy difference (the Lamb shift) is minuscule compared to the $2p \\rightarrow 1s$ energy difference. The rate is proportional to $\\omega^3$, making the $2p \\rightarrow 1s$ transition (Lyman-alpha) vastly more probable.\n    *   Therefore, the state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability (branching ratio) of essentially 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:** The total probability for a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of the two steps.\n    *   $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,m'\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    *   $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Any of the three possible routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. Now we check the given options.\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect and there is a typo in the initial state.\n\nThe correct option describes a valid route with the calculated probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nAn electric dipole transition in a hydrogen atom is governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers $|n,l,m\\rangle$:\n1.  $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n2.  $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n3.  $\\Delta n$ can be any integer. For a decay process (emission), $n$ must decrease.\n\nThe problem describes a two-step cascade decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Selection rule for $l$**: Since $l_{initial}=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 0 \\pm 1 = 1$.\n*   **Selection rule for $m$**: Since $m_{initial}=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0 + (0, \\pm 1) = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Selection rule for $n$**: For a decay, $n' < n$. The problem options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is the most probable transition as it has a smaller change in $n$.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. All paths shown in the options go through one of these states, so they are all valid routes.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.**\n\n*   **Intermediate state:** $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$, with $n'=2, l'=1, m' \\in \\{1,0,-1\\}$.\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$, with $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Selection rule for $l$**: $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Selection rule for $m$**: $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate $m' \\in \\{1,0,-1\\}$.\n    *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. Allowed.\n    *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. Allowed.\n    *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = +1$. Allowed.\n\nSo, all three cascade paths are allowed:\n*   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nNow, we must determine the probability, which corresponds to the branching ratio for a given route. The probability of a cascade is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n**Branching Ratio for Step 1:**\n\nThe transition rate for spontaneous emission from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is given by:\n$\\Gamma_{i \\to f} \\propto |\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$\nwhere $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2$.\n\nWe need to compare the rates for the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the three possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n*   $\\Gamma_0 \\propto |\\langle 2,1,0 | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n*   $\\Gamma_1 \\propto |\\langle 2,1,1 | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n*   $\\Gamma_{-1} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,-1 | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). A spherically symmetric state has no preferred orientation in space. Therefore, when it decays, it must populate the degenerate final substates $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ equally. This physical intuition implies that the transition rates are equal:\n$\\Gamma_0 = \\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma_{-1}$\n\nA formal calculation using the Wigner-Eckart theorem or by calculating the matrix elements directly (using line strength formulas) confirms this result. The relative strengths for the transition from $l=0, m=0$ to $l'=1, m'=\\{1,0,-1\\}$ are in the ratio 1:1:1.\n\nSince there are three equally probable decay channels to the $2p$ subshell, the total rate is $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_{-1} = 3\\Gamma_0$. The branching ratio for the decay into any specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n$BR(\\text{step 1, to } m') = \\frac{\\Gamma_{m'}}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Branching Ratio for Step 2:**\n\nFor the second step, the atom is in one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states. The only possible decay via an electric dipole transition is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Any other transition is either forbidden or involves a much weaker mechanism. For example, decay to the $|2,0,0\\rangle$ state is forbidden by $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$. Decay to higher states is impossible. Therefore, the branching ratio for the second step, regardless of the intermediate state, is 1.\n$BR(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n**Total Probability of the Cascade Route**\n\nThe total probability (or combined branching ratio) for a specific route is the product of the branching ratios of its steps. For the route specified in options A and C: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nProbability = $BR(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times BR(|2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$\nProbability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSimilarly, the probability for the routes through $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ would also be $1/3$.\n\nNow we check the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$.

(Probability is incorrect)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state to a final state via intermediate states is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. These rules dictate which transitions are \"allowed\" to occur.\n\nThe selection rules for a transition from a state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ to $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ are:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n\nLet's analyze the proposed decay route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$:\n\n1.  **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   Intermediate state: $n'=2, l'=1, m'=0$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = 1 - 0 = +1$. This is an allowed transition.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0 - 0 = 0$. This is also an allowed transition.\n    Therefore, the first step of the decay is valid according to the selection rules.\n\n2.  **Second transition: $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Intermediate state: $n=2, l=1, m=0$.\n    *   Final state: $n'=1, l'=0, m'=0$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0 - 0 = 0$. This is also an allowed transition.\n    Therefore, the second step is also valid. The entire cascade is an allowed process.\n\nNext, we must determine the probability of this specific decay channel. The decay process begins with the transition from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (or 3s) state. The only allowed decay according to the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule is to a state with $l=1$ (a p-state). For $n=2$, this corresponds to the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (or 2p) states.\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). Because of this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. This means that the three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are populated with equal probability. The total probability of transitioning to one of these three states is 1, so the probability for transitioning to any specific one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nOnce the atom is in the intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it must decay to a lower energy level. The only possible final state via an electric dipole transition is $|1,0,0\\rangle$, as it is the only state that satisfies the selection rules for a subsequent decay. Thus, the probability of the second step, $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, is 1.\n\nThe total probability for the cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n$P(\\text{total}) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThis matches the path and probability described in option A.\n\nThe correct transition route and probability are:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state to a final state via dipole transitions is governed by a set of selection rules. This two-step transition from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state must adhere to these rules at each step.\n\n### Analysis of the Transition Route\n\n**1. Dipole Transition Selection Rules:**\nFor a non-relativistic hydrogen atom, electric dipole transitions are subject to the following selection rules for the quantum numbers *l* (azimuthal or orbital angular momentum) and *m* (magnetic):\n*   **Δl = ±1**\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**\n\nThe principal quantum number *n* must decrease for a decay process (n<sub>final</sub> < n<sub>initial</sub>).\n\n**2. First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → Intermediate State |n',l',m'⟩**\n*   The initial state has *n*=3, *l*=0, and *m*=0.\n*   For the first decay step, *l* must change by ±1. Since *l*=0, the only possibility is **Δl = +1**, meaning the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n*   The magnetic quantum number *m* can change by 0 or ±1. Since the initial *m*=0, the possible values for the intermediate state's magnetic quantum number are **m' = -1, 0, or 1**.\n*   The principal quantum number *n* must be less than 3. The options provided suggest an intermediate state with **n' = 2**.\n*   Combining these, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n**3. Second Transition: Intermediate State |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n*   The final state is |1,0,0⟩, which has *l*=0.\n*   For the transition from the intermediate state (*l'*=1) to the final state (*l*=0), the change is **Δl = 0 - 1 = -1**. This is an allowed transition.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = 0 - m', also satisfies the selection rules for all possible m' values (-1, 0, 1).\n*   Therefore, all three potential pathways are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This corresponds to the branching ratio for that particular decay cascade.\n\n1.  **First Step Branching Ratio:** The decay starts from the |3,0,0⟩ state. This state is spherically symmetric (since *l*=0). Because of this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the first photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three possible intermediate states: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,1⟩. The total probability must be 1, so the probability of transitioning into any single one of these states is 1/3.\n\n2.  **Second Step Branching Ratio:** Once the atom is in one of the |2,1,m'⟩ states (a 2p orbital), it must decay to a lower energy level. The only state with *n*=1 that satisfies the Δl=±1 rule is the |1,0,0⟩ state (the 1s ground state). Decay to the |2,0,0⟩ state is forbidden. Therefore, the probability of the second step, |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, is 1 for any of the three intermediate states.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe overall probability for any of the specific two-step decay routes is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n*   P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩) = 1/3\n*   P(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = 1\n\nThus, the probability for the specific route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ is (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) Probability of 1/4 is incorrect.\n*   B) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3 is correct.\n*   C) Probability of 1/4 is incorrect.\n*   D) Probability of 2/3 is incorrect.\n\nThe correct transition route and probability are:\n$$ |3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{1}{3} $$\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a two-step radiative decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ to the final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1, 0, 0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. This is also known as a cascade decay.\n\n2.  **Recall Selection Rules:** Electric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers:\n    *   Change in principal quantum number, $\\Delta n = n_{final} - n_{initial}$: can be any integer. For decay (emission), energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n    *   Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial}$: must be $\\pm 1$.\n    *   Change in magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial}$: must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade.\n\n    *   **First Transition: $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n        *   $\\Delta n = n' - 3 < 0 \\implies n' < 3$. So, $n'$ can be 1 or 2.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$ (since $l'$ must be non-negative).\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition: $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$**\n        *   $\\Delta n = 1 - n' < 0 \\implies n' > 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = 0 - l' = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$. This is consistent with the first transition.\n        *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This implies that the initial $m'$ for this step could be $0, 1, -1$, which is also consistent.\n\n    *   **Combining the constraints on $n'$**: From the first transition, $n' < 3$. From the second, $n' > 1$. Therefore, the only possible value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n' = 2$.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for the intermediate state:** The intermediate state must be of the form $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$, where $m'$ can be $-1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n\n4.  **Identify the Possible Decay Routes:** Based on the possible intermediate states, there are three distinct routes for the cascade decay:\n    *   **Route 1:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   **Route 2:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   **Route 3:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n    All the options in the question list one of these valid routes.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):** The question asks for the probability associated with a specific route. In this context, this refers to the branching ratio: the fraction of decays from the initial state that proceed through that particular intermediate state. The branching ratio is determined by the relative rates of the first transition.\n\n    The rate of spontaneous emission (Einstein A coefficient) for a transition from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n    $A_{i \\rightarrow f} \\propto \\omega_{if}^3 |\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\mathbf{d} = -e\\mathbf{r}$ is the electric dipole operator.\n\n    We need to compare the rates for the three possible first transitions:\n    *   $A_0: |3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$\n    *   $A_1: |3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle$\n    *   $A_{-1}: |3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle$\n\n    Since the energy difference (and thus the frequency $\\omega$) is the same for all three transitions (from $n=3$ to $n=2$), the relative rates are determined solely by the squared matrix elements $|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    A key physical principle simplifies this calculation: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, meaning it is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to emit a photon in any direction, leading to any of the allowed final $m'$ states. The decay rates to the different magnetic sublevels $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be identical.\n\n    *   $A_0 = A_1 = A_{-1}$\n\n    Since there are three equally probable channels for the first decay step, the total rate is $A_{total} = A_0 + A_1 + A_{-1} = 3A_0$. The probability, or branching ratio, for any single channel (e.g., the one going through $|2,1,0\\rangle$) is:\n    $P(\\text{via } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{A_0}{A_{total}} = \\frac{A_0}{3A_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    Similarly, the branching ratios for the other two routes are also $1/3$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect (it should be $1/3$).\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect (it should be $1/3$).\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the calculated probability (branching ratio) is correct.\n\nTherefore, option D provides a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process:** The problem describes a two-step electric dipole transition in a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is a cascade decay. A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden by the dipole selection rules, as the change in orbital angular momentum quantum number $\\Delta l$ would be 0, but the rule requires $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Intermediate State:** The transition must proceed through an intermediate state, let's call it $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$. The options suggest the intermediate state has a principal quantum number $n_i=2$.\n\n3.  **Apply Selection Rules for the First Transition:**\n    *   Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,l_i,m_i\\rangle$.\n    *   Selection rule for $l$: $\\Delta l = l_i - l_{initial} = l_i - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l_i=1$.\n    *   Selection rule for $m$: $\\Delta m = m_i - m_{initial} = m_i - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. Since $l_i=1$, the possible values for $m_i$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n    *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply Selection Rules for the Second Transition:**\n    *   Transition: $|2,1,m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Selection rule for $l$: $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_i = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n    *   Selection rule for $m$: $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_i = 0 - m_i$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible values of $m_i$ (i.e., for $m_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$).\n    *   Therefore, all three paths are allowed by the selection rules:\n        *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) for each path:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the branching ratios of each step. The branching ratio for a particular decay channel is the rate of that decay divided by the total decay rate of the initial state.\n\n    *   **First step: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_i\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space.\n        *   Therefore, the emission of the photon is isotropic in the sense that the atom is equally likely to transition to any of the allowed final magnetic sublevels ($m_i = -1, 0, 1$).\n        *   More formally, the transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle 2,1,m_i | e\\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, it can be shown that this quantity is independent of $m_i$ when the initial state has $m=0$.\n        *   Since the rates to the three intermediate states are equal, and these are the only allowed dipole transitions to the $n=2$ shell, the probability of transitioning to any one of them is the same.\n        *   Total decay channels to $n=2, l=1$: 3.\n        *   Probability (Branching Ratio) for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$ = $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n        *   Probability (Branching Ratio) for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle$ = $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n        *   Probability (Branching Ratio) for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle$ = $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Second step: $|2,1,m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   We need to consider the total decay rate from the intermediate state $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$.\n        *   According to the dipole selection rules, the state $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ (a $2p$ state) can decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the $1s$ state).\n        *   In the non-relativistic theory of the H-atom, the energy levels depend only on the principal quantum number $n$. Thus, $E_{2s} = E_{2p}$. A transition from $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ to $|2,0,0\\rangle$ would have zero energy difference ($\\omega=0$) and is therefore forbidden (it does occur via the Lamb shift, but that is a relativistic QED effect).\n        *   Therefore, the only available decay channel for the $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ state via a single dipole transition is to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   This means the branching ratio for the second step is 1, regardless of the intermediate $m_i$ value. $P(|2,1,m_i\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n    *   **Total Probability for a Specific Path:**\n        *   The probability for the path passing through $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is:\n            $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is a valid route. The probability of the cascade proceeding via this specific path is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches option D. The other paths through $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ also have a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$, which makes options B and C incorrect. Option A has the correct path but an incorrect probability.\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\nThe problem describes a two-step radiative decay of a hydrogen atom from the excited state |3,0,0> to the ground state |1,0,0>. Each step is an electric dipole transition, which means they must obey the electric dipole selection rules. The process can be written as:\n|3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\nOur goal is to identify the intermediate state |n',l',m'⟩ and the probability of this specific decay channel.\n\n### 2. Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nFor an electric dipole transition from an initial state |n,l,m⟩ to a final state |n',l',m'⟩, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n*   **Δl = l' - l = ±1**\n*   **Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1**\n*   For a decay (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so **n' < n**.\n\n### 3. Step 1: First Transition (|3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩)\nLet's apply the selection rules to the initial state |i⟩ = |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0).\n\n*   **Rule for l:** Since l=0, Δl must be +1 (because l cannot be negative). Therefore, the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n*   **Rule for n:** For a state with orbital quantum number l', the principal quantum number n' must be at least l'+1. Since l'=1, we must have n' ≥ 2. Also, due to the decay, n' < n, so n' < 3. The only integer satisfying both n' ≥ 2 and n' < 3 is **n' = 2**.\n*   **Rule for m:** Since m=0, the change Δm can be 0, +1, or -1. Thus, the intermediate magnetic quantum number can be m' = m + Δm = 0 + (0, ±1), which gives **m' = -1, 0, or +1**.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n### 4. Step 2: Second Transition (|n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\nNow, we must check if a transition from these intermediate states to the final state |f⟩ = |1,0,0⟩ is allowed.\n\n*   **Rule for l:** The change is Δl = l_final - l_intermediate = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the Δl=±1 rule.\n*   **Rule for m:** The change is Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m'. For this to be allowed (Δm=0,±1), m' must be one of {-1, 0, 1}. All three of our possible intermediate states satisfy this.\n\nTherefore, all three decay paths are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the probability of a *specific* route. This is the branching ratio of the first transition. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is a 3s orbital, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, space is isotropic (has no preferred direction). Therefore, there is no reason for the atom to prefer decaying to one m' state over another. The three possible destination states (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩) are degenerate in energy.\n\nThis symmetry implies that the transition rates to these three states must be equal. Let the probability of transitioning to |2,1,m'⟩ be P(m').\nThen, **P(-1) = P(0) = P(1)**.\n\nSince these three paths are the only possible outcomes for the first decay step, their probabilities must sum to 1:\nP_total = P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1\n3 × P(0) = 1\n**P(0) = 1/3**\n\nSo, the probability for the specific route passing through |2,1,0⟩ is 1/3. The same probability of 1/3 applies to the routes passing through |2,1,-1⟩ and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n### 6. Comparing with the Options\nLet's examine the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4:** The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3:** The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   **C) ⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3:** The probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4:** The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that matches our analysis is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nAnswering this question requires understanding the selection rules for electric dipole transitions in a hydrogen atom and calculating the branching ratios for the possible decay paths.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Transition Route\n\nThe atom transitions from the initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$ via two dipole transitions. This implies the existence of an intermediate state, let's call it $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$.\n\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole (E1) transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n\n**First Transition: $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Change in $l$**: The initial state has $l=0$. According to the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l_i = 1$.\n*   **Change in $m$**: The initial state has $m=0$. According to the selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m_i = 0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n*   **Change in $n$**: For a decay (emission) process, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease. Since the final state is $n=1$, the intermediate state must have $n_i=2$. A transition from $n=3$ to $n=1$ directly is forbidden by the $\\Delta l$ rule.\n*   **Intermediate States**: Combining these, the possible intermediate states are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|2, 1, m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$**\n\nLet's check if transitions from our identified intermediate states to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$ are allowed.\n*   **Change in $l$**: The initial (intermediate) state has $l_i=1$, and the final state has $l_f=0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Change in $m$**: The final state has $m_f=0$. The initial (intermediate) state can have $m_i = -1, 0, 1$. The change is $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = -m_i$. In all cases (for $m_i = -1, 0, 1$), $\\Delta m$ will be $1, 0,$ or $-1$, which is allowed.\n\nSo, all three possible routes are valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThe options presented in the question (A, B, C) all list one of these valid routes. To find the correct answer, we must calculate the probability of these routes.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Probability\n\nThe \"probability\" of a specific transition route in a cascade process refers to the branching ratio of the first step. This is because once the atom reaches one of the intermediate $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ states, it has only one allowed dipole transition to a lower energy state, which is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of the second step, given the first has occurred, is 1.\n\nThe branching ratio for the decay into a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ is:\n$P(m_i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m_i\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m'=-1,0,1} \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)}$\nwhere $\\Gamma(i \\to f)$ is the transition rate from state $i$ to state $f$.\n\nThe transition rate for spontaneous emission is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the electric dipole matrix element:\n$\\Gamma(i \\to f) \\propto |\\langle f | e\\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = e^2 |\\langle f | \\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2$\n\nWe need to compare the rates $\\Gamma$ for the three possible values of $m_i (-1, 0, 1)$.\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). When an unpolarized atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the sublevels of the final state are populated equally.\n\nLet's verify this with a calculation. The rate is proportional to:\n$|\\langle 2,1,m_i | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,m_i | x | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m_i | y | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m_i | z | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nUsing the properties of spherical harmonics, one can show that:\n*   The matrix element of $z$ ($z=r\\cos\\theta \\propto Y_{1,0}$) is non-zero only for transitions where $\\Delta m = 0$. So, it only contributes to the decay to $|2,1,0\\rangle$.\n*   The matrix elements of $x$ and $y$ (which are linear combinations of $r Y_{1,1}$ and $r Y_{1,-1}$) are non-zero only for transitions where $\\Delta m = \\pm 1$. They contribute to the decays to $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\nA detailed calculation of the integrals shows that the total transition probability, summed over all polarizations, is independent of the final magnetic quantum number $m_i$:\n$|\\langle 2,1,-1 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,0 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,1 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nSince the energy difference $\\Delta E = E_{3s} - E_{2p}$ is the same for all three transitions, the transition rates are equal:\n$\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\nLet this rate be $\\Gamma_0$. The total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $|2,1\\rangle$ manifold is $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n\nThe probability (branching ratio) for any one of these specific paths is:\n$P = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nEach of the three possible decay routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.

Em todos os casos, $\\Delta m$ será $0$ ou $\\pm 1$, o que é permitido.\n\nAssim, todas as três rotas de transição são possíveis:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**Passo 3: Calcular a probabilidade da rota de transição.**\n\nA probabilidade total de uma rota em cascata é o produto das probabilidades de cada passo. O primeiro passo é o decaimento do estado $|3,0,0\\rangle$ para um dos três subníveis $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\nO estado inicial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (um estado 3s) é esfericamente simétrico. Na ausência de campos externos, não há direção preferencial no espaço. Portanto, a probabilidade de transição para cada um dos subníveis magnéticos $m'=-1, 0, +1$ do estado $l'=1$ (um estado 2p) é a mesma.\n\nA taxa de transição total do estado $|3,0,0\\rangle$ para o nível $n=2, l=1$ é a soma das taxas para os três subníveis $m'$:\n$\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma(m'=-1) + \\Gamma(m'=0) + \\Gamma(m'=+1)$\n\nComo as taxas são iguais:\n$\\Gamma(m'=-1) = \\Gamma(m'=0) = \\Gamma(m'=+1)$\n\nA fração de ramificação (a probabilidade de decair para um subnível específico $m'$) é:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(m')}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma(m')}{3 \\times \\Gamma(m')} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nUma vez que o átomo está no estado intermédio (qualquer um dos $|2,1,m'\\rangle$), a única transição de dipolo permitida para um nível de energia inferior é para o estado fundamental $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Portanto, a probabilidade deste segundo passo é 1.\n\nA probabilidade total para a rota de transição $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ é o produto da fração de ramificação do primeiro passo e a probabilidade do segundo passo:\n$P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nComparando com as opções fornecidas:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ e $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Probabilidade incorreta)\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ e $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Rota e probabilidade corretas)\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ e $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Probabilidade incorreta)\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ e $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Probabilidade incorreta)\n\nA resposta correta é a B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state is a two-photon process, as a single-photon transition is forbidden by the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. The decay must proceed through an intermediate state.\n\n**1. Selection Rules:**\nFor an electric dipole transition, the selection rules for the orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* and the magnetic quantum number *m* are:\n*   Δ*l* = *l*<sub>final</sub> - *l*<sub>initial</sub> = ±1\n*   Δ*m* = *m*<sub>final</sub> - *m*<sub>initial</sub> = 0, ±1\n\n**2. Identifying the Transition Route:**\nThe process occurs in two steps:\n*   **Step 1:** Transition from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩.\n    *   Applying the selection rules to the initial state |*n*=3, *l*=0, *m*=0⟩:\n        *   Δ*l* = *l'* - 0 = ±1  ⇒ *l'* = 1.\n        *   Δ*m* = *m'* - 0 = 0, ±1 ⇒ *m'* can be 0, 1, or -1.\n    *   For a decay, the principal quantum number *n* must decrease. A prominent intermediate state is the *n'*=2 level. Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n*   **Step 2:** Transition from the intermediate state |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩.\n    *   Let's check the validity of the options provided. All options point to the intermediate state being one of the *n'*=2, *l'*=1 levels.\n    *   Let's verify the transition from the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩:\n        *   Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1 (Allowed).\n        *   Δ*m* = 0 - 0 = 0 (Allowed).\n    *   This confirms that the cascade |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is a valid decay route according to the selection rules. The other possible routes through |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩ are also valid.\n\n**3. Determining the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio):**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific decay route. This refers to the branching ratio of the initial decay step. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (a 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. When it decays, it can transition to any of the three degenerate sublevels of the 2p state: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\nBecause the initial state is spherically symmetric and in the absence of any external polarizing fields, the probability of transitioning to any of the available degenerate final states is equal. The 2p state has three such sublevels (*m'* = -1, 0, 1).\n\nTherefore, the total probability of 1 is distributed equally among these three channels:\n*   Probability(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = 1/3\n*   Probability(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = 1/3\n*   Probability(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩) = 1/3\n\nThe transition from the 2p state to the 1s state is extremely fast, so the probability of the second step is nearly 1. The overall probability of the cascade is thus determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\nBased on this analysis, the probability for the transition route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) Probability of 2/3 is incorrect.\n*   B) Probability of 1/4 is incorrect.\n*   C) Probability of 1/4 is incorrect.\n*   D) Proposes the route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3, which matches our derivation.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThe problem asks for the correct decay route and corresponding probability for a Hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade process through an intermediate state $|k\\rangle$:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_1} |k\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_2} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nWe must first identify the allowed intermediate states $|k\\rangle = |n_k, l_k, m_k\\rangle$ using the selection rules for E1 transitions:\n$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n$\\Delta n$ can be anything, but for spontaneous emission, the energy of the state must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|k\\rangle = |n_k, l_k, m_k\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\implies n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n*   For an E1 transition, $\\Delta l = l_k - l_i = l_k - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l_k = 1$.\n*   For the selection rule on $m$, $\\Delta m = m_k - m_i = m_k - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, $m_k$ can be $0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n*   Since the final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$, the intermediate state must have $n_k=2$ for a cascade decay ($E_3 > E_2 > E_1$).\n*   Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m_k\\rangle$ to $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$**\nLet's check if transitions from these intermediate states to the final state are allowed.\n*   Initial state: $|2,1,m_k\\rangle \\implies n_k=2, l_k=1, m_k \\in \\{1,0,-1\\}$.\n*   Final state: $|1,0,0\\rangle \\implies n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_k = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_k = 0 - m_k$. This requires $\\Delta m = 0$ for $m_k=0$, $\\Delta m = -1$ for $m_k=1$, and $\\Delta m = +1$ for $m_k=-1$. All these values for $\\Delta m$ are allowed.\n*   Therefore, all three paths are possible according to the selection rules:\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**Calculating the Probability**\n\nThe \"probability\" of a given route corresponds to its branching ratio. The branching ratio for a specific path is determined by the probability of the first transition, assuming the intermediate state has only one subsequent decay channel leading to the final state.\n\nIn the non-relativistic theory of the H-atom, energy levels depend only on $n$. Therefore, a state with $n=2, l=1$ (a $2p$ state) can only decay to a state with $n=1$. The only state with $n=1$ is $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the $1s$ state). Thus, the transition from any of the $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$ states to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ has a probability of 1.\n\nThe overall probability for each path is therefore equal to the branching ratio of the first step: the transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to one of the $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$ states.\n\nThe transition rate $A(i \\to f)$ is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, summed over all possible polarizations of the emitted photon: $A(i \\to f) \\propto |\\langle f |e\\vec{r}| i \\rangle|^2 = e^2 \\sum_q |\\langle f |r_q| i \\rangle|^2$.\n\nLet's find the rate for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m_k\\rangle$:\n$A(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m_k) \\propto \\sum_q |\\langle 2,1,m_k | r_q | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\nFrom the selection rule on $m$, $m_{final} = m_{initial} + q$, we have $m_k = 0 + q$, so $q=m_k$. This means for each final state $m_k$, only one term in the sum is non-zero.\n$A(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m_k) \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m_k | r_{m_k} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n\nWe can evaluate this using the Wigner-Eckart theorem:\n$\\langle n'l'm'|T_q^k|nlm\\rangle = \\frac{\\langle n'l'||T^k||nl\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2l'+1}}\\langle lm;kq|l'm'\\rangle$.\nFor our transition, $|nlm\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, $|n'l'm'\\rangle = |2,1,m_k\\rangle$, $k=1$, and $q=m_k$:\n$\\langle 2,1,m_k|r_{m_k}|3,0,0\\rangle = \\frac{\\langle 2,1||r||3,0\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2(1)+1}}\\langle 0,0;1,m_k|1,m_k\\rangle$.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 0,0;1,m_k|1,m_k\\rangle = 1$ for all allowed values of $m_k$ (i.e., -1, 0, 1).\nThe reduced matrix element $\\langle 2,1||r||3,0\\rangle$ is a constant that does not depend on any of the magnetic quantum numbers.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the matrix element is the same for all three final states $m_k$:\n$|\\langle 2,1,m_k|r_{m_k}|3,0,0\\rangle|^2 = |\\frac{\\langle 2,1||r||3,0\\rangle}{\\sqrt{3}}|^2$.\n\nThis means the transition rates to each of the three intermediate states are equal. Let the rate be $A_1$.\n$A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) = A_1$\n$A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = A_1$\n$A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = A_1$\n\nThe total transition rate out of $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (into the $2p$ shell) is $A_{total} = A_1 + A_1 + A_1 = 3A_1$.\nThe branching ratio for any one of these paths is the rate for that path divided by the total rate:\n$B = \\frac{A_1}{3A_1} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSo, each of the three possible decay routes has a probability of $1/3$.\nLet's check the options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\nD) $\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions follows specific quantum mechanical selection rules. This process is a cascade decay, where the atom first transitions to an intermediate state and then to the final state.\n\n**Step 1: First Dipole Transition**\n\nThe initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0>, which corresponds to the 3s orbital. According to the electric dipole transition selection rules, the orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* must change by ±1 (Δ*l* = ±1), and the magnetic quantum number *m* can change by 0 or ±1 (Δ*m* = 0, ±1).\n\n*   From *l*=0, the only possibility is a transition to *l*=1 (a *p* orbital).\n*   The principal quantum number *n* must decrease, so a transition to *n*=2 is required for a two-step decay to *n*=1. A direct decay to *n=1* would require a change in *l*, resulting in a |1,1,m> state, but this is not the final state |1,0,0>.\n*   For the transition from |3,0,0> to a state with *l*=1, the magnetic quantum number *m* can become -1, 0, or 1.\n\nThis means the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. Since the initial |3,0,0> state is spherically symmetric and the decay process is isotropic (assuming no external fields), the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of these three *m* sub-levels. Therefore, the probability of transitioning into any specific intermediate state, such as |2,1,0>, is 1/3.\n\n**Step 2: Second Dipole Transition**\n\nThe second transition is from the intermediate state |2,1,m> to the final state |1,0,0> (the 1s orbital). Let's check the selection rules for each possible intermediate state:\n\n*   **From |2,1,0> to |1,0,0>**: Δ*l* = 1 → 0 = -1 (allowed), and Δ*m* = 0 → 0 = 0 (allowed). This is a valid transition.\n*   **From |2,1,1> to |1,0,0>**: Δ*l* = 1 → 0 = -1 (allowed), and Δ*m* = 1 → 0 = -1 (allowed). This is a valid transition.\n*   **From |2,1,-1> to |1,0,0>**: Δ*l* = 1 → 0 = -1 (allowed), and Δ*m* = -1 → 0 = +1 (allowed). This is a valid transition.\n\nFrom any of the |2,1,m> states, the only energetically favorable state that can be reached via a single dipole transition is the |1,0,0> state. Therefore, the probability of this second step occurring from any of the allowed intermediate states is 1 (or 100%).\n\n**Overall Probability**\n\nThe total probability for a specific decay path is the product of the probabilities of each individual step. For the path |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>:\n\n*   Probability = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) × P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>)\n*   Probability = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\nTherefore, the transition route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> has a total probability of 1/3.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle \\text{ and } \\frac{1}{3}}$\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nMy plan is to determine the correct transition route and its probability based on the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions in a Hydrogen atom.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Selection Rules**: First, I will state the E1 selection rules, which govern which transitions are allowed. These rules are $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. The principal quantum number $n$ must also change.\n2.  **Verify the Transition Routes**: I will apply these rules to the proposed two-step decay: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$. I will confirm that both steps in the routes listed in the options are allowed by the selection rules.\n3.  **Calculate the Probabilities**: The core of the problem is to determine the probability of each route. For a cascade decay, the probability of a specific path is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, assuming the second step is guaranteed (which it is, as the $2p$ state can only decay to the $1s$ state). The branching ratio depends on the transition rates.\n4.  **Evaluate Transition Rates**: I will use the fact that the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). For spontaneous emission from such a state, the transition rates to each of the possible magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the final $l'=1$ state are identical.\n5.  **Determine Branching Ratios**: Since there are three equally probable intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$), the probability of branching into any single one of them is $1/3$.\n6.  **Select the Correct Option**: Finally, I will compare this result with the given options to find the one that correctly pairs a valid route with the calculated probability of $1/3$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_h_atom_decay():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of H-atom cascade decay from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0>.\n\n    The function applies the selection rules for electric dipole transitions and\n    calculates the probability of the specified decay routes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the problem and selection rules\n    initial_state = \"|3,0,0>\"\n    final_state = \"|1,0,0>\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing the two-step dipole transition from {initial_state} to {final_state}.\")\n    print(\"The selection rules for an electric dipole (E1) transition are:\")\n    print(\"Δl = ±1\")\n    print(\"Δm = 0, ±1\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the proposed transition routes\n    print(\"The decay proceeds through an intermediate state, specified in the options as |2,1,m'>.\")\n\n    # First transition: |3,0,0> -> |2,1,m'>\n    # l=0 -> l'=1 satisfies Δl = +1.\n    # m=0 -> m' can be -1, 0, or 1, which satisfies Δm = -1, 0, +1.\n    # n=3 -> n'=2 means energy is released.\n    # This step is valid.\n\n    # Second transition: |2,1,m'> -> |1,0,0>\n    # l'=1 -> l''=0 satisfies Δl = -1.\n    # m' -> m''=0 implies Δm = -m'.

The principal quantum number $n$ can change by any integer value ($\\Delta n = \\text{any integer}$). For a decay (photon emission), the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$\nLet's apply the selection rules to find the possible intermediate states $|k\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Rule for $\\Delta l$:** $\\Delta l = l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Rule for $\\Delta n$:** The atom decays, so energy decreases. Thus, $n' < n=3$. The problem options suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$, which is allowed. Any other $n'$ is not mentioned in the options. So we consider $n'=2$.\n*   **Rule for $\\Delta m$:** $\\Delta m = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $0, +1, -1$.\n\nCombining these, the possible intermediate states are:\n*   $|2,1,0\\rangle$\n*   $|2,1,1\\rangle$\n*   $|2,1,-1\\rangle$\nThese correspond to the three degenerate substates of the 2p orbital.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\nLet's check if the second step is allowed for each of the possible intermediate states.\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **For intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$:**\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$ (Allowed).\n    *   This transition is allowed. The route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is possible.\n*   **For intermediate state $|2,1,1\\rangle$:**\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   This transition is allowed. The route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is possible.\n*   **For intermediate state $|2,1,-1\\rangle$:**\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$ (Allowed).\n    *   This transition is allowed. The route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is possible.\n\nAll three routes suggested by the selection rules are physically possible.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Probability of the Transition Route\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. In a cascade decay, this corresponds to the branching ratio of the first transition, assuming the intermediate state decays with 100% probability to the final state (which is true here, as the only dipole-allowed decay from 2p is to 1s).\n\nThe probability of the route via $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is given by:\n$P(\\text{route via } m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m''=-1}^{1} \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m''\\rangle)}$\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is the transition rate.\n\nThe transition rate $\\Gamma(i \\to f)$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n$\\Gamma(i \\to f) \\propto |\\langle f | e\\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = e^2 (|\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2)$\n\nLet's evaluate the rates for the first transition: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and $|f\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Initial State:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric.\n*   **Final States:** The final states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields).\n\nA key principle of quantum mechanics (related to the Wigner-Eckart theorem) states that for a transition from a spherically symmetric state ($l=0$) to a set of degenerate states, the transition rate to each of these final states is equal. This is because there is no preferred direction in space for the spherically symmetric initial state.\n\nTherefore, the rates must be equal:\n$\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle)$\n\nLet's call this common rate $\\Gamma_0$. The total transition rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ manifold is the sum of the individual rates:\n$\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n\nThe probability (branching ratio) for the atom to decay into a specific intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n$P(\\text{route via } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle)}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSimilarly, the probability for the route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is also $1/3$, and the probability for the route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is also $1/3$.\n\n### Step 6: Compare with the Given Options\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    This option presents a valid route and the calculated probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our analysis perfectly.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only option that is consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics for dipole transitions is option A. The specific route is allowed by the selection rules, and the probability of this specific channel, among the three equally likely channels, is exactly $1/3$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nThe problem asks for the specific pathway and the corresponding probability for a hydrogen atom to decay from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through a cascade of two electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n**2. Recall the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\nFor an E1 transition between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$, the following selection rules for the quantum numbers must be obeyed:\n*   **Parity change:** The parity of the state must change. This is equivalent to $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Angular momentum projection:** The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Principal quantum number:** There is no selection rule for $\\Delta n = n' - n$, but for spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, which means $n' < n$.\n\n**3. Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = m'$. So, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n    *   $n' < 3$. A common decay path involves the lowest possible change in $n$, so the intermediate state is likely to have $n'=2$. The problem options confirm this by proposing intermediate states with $n=2$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**4. Analyze the Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state (intermediate):** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ where $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n*   **Final state:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the selection rules for each possible intermediate state:\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$.\n        *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. Allowed.\n        *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. Allowed.\n        *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = +1$. Allowed.\n*   Conclusion: All three paths are allowed by the selection rules.\n    *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**5. Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\nThe probability of a specific decay channel depends on the square of the transition matrix element $|\\langle \\text{final} | -e\\vec{r} | \\text{initial} \\rangle|^2$. For a given change in $n$ and $l$ (e.g., $3s \\rightarrow 2p$), the radial part of this integral is the same for all $m'$ states. The branching ratio into the different $m'$ states is determined by the angular part of the integral.\n\nThe initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$. The angular part of its wavefunction is $Y_0^0$, which is spherically symmetric (a constant). Due to this symmetry, the atom has no preferred direction of emission. When averaged over all possible emission directions and polarizations, the decay probability is distributed equally among the available final $m'$ states.\n\nLet's confirm this with the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The transition rate from $|nlm\\rangle$ to $|n'l'm'\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: $|\\langle l,m; 1,q | l',m' \\rangle|^2$, where $q = m'-m$.\nFor the first transition, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n*   $l=0, m=0$. $l'=1, m'=m'$. So $q=m'$.\n*   We need the coefficients $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$.\n*   When coupling any angular momentum $j_2$ to $j_1=0$, the resulting angular momentum is $j=j_2$ and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle 0,0; j_2,m_2 | j_2,m_2 \\rangle$ are always 1.\n*   This means the angular factors are the same for $m'=0, 1, -1$.\n\nTherefore, the probabilities for decaying into each of the three intermediate states are equal.\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = C$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = C$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = C$\n\nSince these are the only three possibilities for the first step of the cascade (to the n=2 shell), the total probability must be 1. Thus, the branching ratio for each path is $1/3$.\n*   Branching Ratio (via $m'=0$) = $1/3$.\n*   Branching Ratio (via $m'=1$) = $1/3$.\n*   Branching Ratio (via $m'=-1$) = $1/3$.\n\nOnce the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it must decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (it cannot decay to $|2,0,0\\rangle$ as that would violate $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$). Therefore, the probability of the second step is 1.\n\nThe overall probability for a given cascade route is the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n**6. Evaluate the Options**\nWe now check the given options against our findings:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation. The route is valid and the probability is correct.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$. This is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$. This is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$. This is incorrect.\n\nOnly option A presents a physically correct statement.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\nHere's a step-by-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial and final states:**\n    *   Initial state: `|n=3, l=0, m=0⟩` or `|3,0,0⟩`. This is a 3s orbital.\n    *   Final state: `|n=1, l=0, m=0⟩` or `|1,0,0⟩`. This is a 1s orbital.\n\n2.  **Understand the transition process:**\n    *   A direct transition from `|3,0,0⟩` to `|1,0,0⟩` is forbidden by the electric dipole selection rules because the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, `Δl`, would be 0.\n    *   The problem states the decay occurs via *two* dipole transitions, implying a cascade through an intermediate state.\n    *   Let the intermediate state be `|n',l',m'⟩`.\n\n3.  **Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules:**\n    The selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   `Δl = ±1`\n    *   `Δm = 0, ±1`\n\n4.  **Determine the intermediate state:**\n    *   **First transition (`|3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩`):**\n        *   The initial state has `l=0`. To satisfy `Δl = ±1`, the intermediate state must have `l'=1`.\n        *   The problem specifies the route goes via `n=2` states, so `n'=2`.\n        *   The initial state has `m=0`. To satisfy `Δm = 0, ±1`, the intermediate state can have `m' = 0, +1,` or `-1`.\n        *   Thus, the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,0⟩`, `|2,1,1⟩`, and `|2,1,-1⟩`.\n    *   **Second transition (`|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`):**\n        *   The final state has `l=0`. The intermediate state has `l'=1`. So, `Δl = 0 - 1 = -1`, which is allowed.\n        *   The final state has `m=0`. The intermediate state has `m'`. So, `Δm = 0 - m'`. Since `m'` can be `0, ±1`, `Δm` can be `0, ∓1`, all of which are allowed.\n    *   Therefore, all three cascade routes are possible:\n        *   `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n        *   `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n        *   `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n    This confirms that the routes listed in options A, C, and D are valid.\n\n5.  **Calculate the probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    *   The probability of a particular cascade route depends on the branching ratio of the first transition, `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩`, since the second transition, `|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`, is the only allowed decay channel from the 2p state (its probability is essentially 1).\n    *   The rate of spontaneous emission for a transition from an initial state `|i⟩` to a final state `|f⟩` is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, `|<f|**r**|i>|²`.\n    *   We need to compare the transition rates from the initial `|3,0,0⟩` state to the three possible intermediate states `|2,1,0⟩`, `|2,1,1⟩`, and `|2,1,-1⟩`.\n    *   The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` is spherically symmetric. The dipole interaction, responsible for the transition, does not have a preferred direction in the absence of external fields. Due to this rotational symmetry, the probability of decaying into any of the magnetic sublevels `m' = -1, 0, +1` of the `l'=1` state must be equal.\n    *   Therefore, the total probability of transitioning from `|3,0,0⟩` to the `|2,1,m'⟩` manifold is split equally among the three `m'` states.\n    *   Total probability = P(m'=-1) + P(m'=0) + P(m'=1) = 1\n    *   Since P(m'=-1) = P(m'=0) = P(m'=1), each probability must be `1/3`.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   A) Path: `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩`. The probability is `1/3`. This matches our calculation.\n    *   B) Path: `|...⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩`. The probability is `2/3`. This is incorrect.\n    *   C) Path: `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩`. The probability is `1/4`. This is incorrect.\n    *   D) Path: `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩`. The probability is `1/4`. This is incorrect.\n\nBased on the principles of quantum mechanics and electric dipole selection rules, the only correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nTo determine the correct transition route and its probability for the decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions, we must apply the selection rules for electric dipole transitions and calculate the branching ratios.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the possible transitions based on selection rules\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   Change in the principal quantum number, n: no restriction, but for decay, Δn < 0.\n*   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, l: Δl = ±1.\n*   Change in the magnetic quantum number, m: Δm = 0, ±1.\n\n**First Transition: |3,0,0> → Intermediate State |n',l',m'>**\n\n*   The initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0>.\n*   According to the Δl = ±1 rule, since l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n*   Since the decay must occur in two steps to reach n=1, and the principal quantum number must decrease, the intermediate state must have n'=2. Decay to n=1 with l=1 is impossible, as n=1 only allows for l=0.\n*   According to the Δm = 0, ±1 rule, since m=0, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n**Second Transition: Intermediate State |2,1,m'> → Final State |1,0,0>**\n\n*   The initial states are |2,1,m'> and the final state is |1,0,0>.\n*   Let's check the selection rules for each possible intermediate state:\n    *   From |2,1,-1> to |1,0,0>: Δl = 0-1 = -1 (allowed); Δm = 0-(-1) = +1 (allowed). This is a valid transition path.\n    *   From |2,1,0> to |1,0,0>: Δl = 0-1 = -1 (allowed); Δm = 0-0 = 0 (allowed). This is a valid transition path.\n    *   From |2,1,1> to |1,0,0>: Δl = 0-1 = -1 (allowed); Δm = 0-1 = -1 (allowed). This is a valid transition path.\n\nAll three transition routes proposed in options A, B, and C are physically possible.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the probability of each transition route\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition step. The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, the three intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> are degenerate.\n\nThe transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole moment matrix element, |<n',l',m'| **r** |n,l,m>|². For a transition from an unpolarized l=0 state to the three different m' substates of an l=1 level, the transition probabilities are equal. This can be formally shown using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, where the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are found to be equal.\n\nTherefore, the atom in the |3,0,0> state has an equal probability of decaying into any of the three |2,1,m'> states.\n*   Total probability of decaying from |3,0,0> to the l=1 level is 1.\n*   Since there are three equally probable final m' states, the probability for each is:\n    *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n    *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n    *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n\nOnce the atom reaches any of the |2,1,m'> states, it is certain to decay to the |1,0,0> state, as this is the only lower-energy state accessible via an electric dipole transition. Thus, the probability of the second step, P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>), is 1.\n\nThe overall probability for each specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n*   Route via |2,1,-1>: P = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n*   Route via |2,1,0>: P = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n*   Route via |2,1,1>: P = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n\n### Step 3: Compare with the given options\n\n*   A) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}  -> Incorrect probability.\n*   B) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{3}  -> **Correct route and probability.**\n*   C) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}  -> Incorrect probability.\n*   D) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{2}{3}  -> Incorrect probability.\n\nThus, option B correctly identifies a possible route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nMy initial reasoning appears correct and is confirmed by the search results.\n\n1.  **Selection Rules**: The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are consistently stated as Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.\n\n2.  **Decay Path**:\n    *   The initial state is |3,0,0>. For the first transition, since l=0, the selection rule Δl = ±1 requires that the intermediate state must have l'=1.\n    *   The problem specifies a two-step decay via the n=2 level. Therefore, the intermediate states must be of the form |2,1,m'>.\n    *   The selection rule Δm = 0, ±1 allows the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate state, m', to be 0, +1, or -1.\n    *   For the second transition from the intermediate state |2,1,m'> to the final state |1,0,0>, the rules are also satisfied: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 and Δm = 0 - m' (which is 0, -1, or +1 for m' = 0, 1, -1 respectively).\n    *   Therefore, all three routes, via |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>, are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n3.  **Probability/Branching Ratio**:\n    *   The key is to determine the probability of entering each of these three allowed channels from the initial |3,0,0> state.\n    *   The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the first photon.\n    *   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment matrix element, `<n',l',m'| **r** |n,l,m>`.\n    *   As confirmed by a source discussing this exact problem, applying the Wigner-Eckart theorem shows that the magnitude of the matrix element for the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m'> is independent of m'. Specifically, the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficients `<l=0, m=0; 1, q | l'=1, m'>` are all equal to 1 for the allowed transitions (where q=m').\n    *   Since the transition rates to the m'=-1, m'=0, and m'=+1 sublevels are equal, and these are the only possibilities for the first step of the decay cascade to n=2, they must be equally probable.\n    *   Once the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'> states (the 2p level), it can only decay to the |1,0,0> ground state via a single photon emission. Thus, the probability of the second step in the cascade is 1.\n    *   Therefore, the overall probability for any one of the specific three decay routes is determined entirely by the branching ratio of the first step, which is 1/3.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The decay route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> has a probability of 1/3. This matches option A. The other options list incorrect probabilities.\n\nFinal Check:\n*   Route A: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> -> Probability = 1/3. Correct.\n*   Route B: Missing initial state but probability of 2/3 is incorrect.\n*   Route C: |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> -> Probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n*   Route D: |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> -> Probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only correct choice.\n\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state cannot happen via a single dipole transition because this would violate the selection rule for the orbital angular momentum quantum number, l (Δl = 0, but the rule is Δl = ±1). The decay must therefore proceed via an intermediate state in a two-step cascade.\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   Δl = ±1\n*   Δm = 0, ±1\n\n**Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state |n',l',m'⟩**\n\nThe problem specifies that the decay route involves an intermediate state with principal quantum number n=2.\n*   Initial state: |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0)\n*   Applying Δl = ±1: Since l=0, the intermediate state must have l'=1.\n*   Applying Δm = 0, ±1: The magnetic quantum number of the intermediate state, m', can be -1, 0, or +1.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state |2,l',m'⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩**\n\nLet's check if transitions from the possible intermediate states to the final state |1,0,0⟩ are allowed:\n*   Intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩ (n'=2, l'=1)\n*   Final state: |1,0,0⟩ (n''=1, l''=0, m''=0)\n*   Check Δl: l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies Δl = ±1.\n*   Check Δm: m'' - m' = 0 - m'. This can be 0, -1, or +1 depending on whether m' is 0, 1, or -1. This satisfies Δm = 0, ±1.\n\nTherefore, all three pathways are allowed by the selection rules:\n1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the probability**\n\nThe probability of a specific decay route depends on the branching ratio of the first transition. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric. In the absence of an external field, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the probabilities of transitioning to each of the three possible m' sub-levels (m' = -1, 0, +1) are equal.\n\nSince there are three equally likely channels for the first step of the decay, the probability for any single channel is 1/3.\n\nThe second step of the decay, from any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states to the |1,0,0⟩ state, is the only possible radiative decay from the 2p level. Therefore, the probability of this transition, given that the atom is in the |2,1,m'⟩ state, is 1.\n\nThe total probability for a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route via the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩:\nP = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3.

The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n*   D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state |n, l, m⟩ = |3, 0, 0⟩ to the final state |1, 0, 0⟩ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n    The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n    *   Δn is not restricted, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), energy must be released, so n must decrease.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State**\n    Let the intermediate state be |n', l', m'⟩.\n    *   **First Transition: |3, 0, 0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩**\n        *   Initial state has l=0. To satisfy Δl=±1, the intermediate state must have l'=1.\n        *   Initial state has m=0. To satisfy Δm=0,±1, the intermediate state can have m' = -1, 0, or +1.\n        *   The principal quantum number n must decrease from n=3. The options provided suggest the intermediate state has n'=2, which is a valid decay path (3s → 2p).\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2, 1, -1⟩, |2, 1, 0⟩, and |2, 1, 1⟩.\n\n    *   **Second Transition: |n', l', m'⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩**\n        *   Let's check if a transition from our potential intermediate states |2, 1, m'⟩ to the final state |1, 0, 0⟩ is allowed.\n        *   The intermediate state has l'=1, and the final state has l_f=0. So, Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is an allowed transition.\n        *   The intermediate state can have m' = -1, 0, or +1, and the final state has m_f=0. So, Δm = 0 - m'. This is -1, 0, or +1 for m'=1, 0, -1 respectively.

The decay process is governed by the interaction Hamiltonian, which, when averaged over all possible emission directions and polarizations of the photon, shows no preference for the final magnetic quantum number m'.\n        *   A more formal argument using the Wigner-Eckart theorem shows that the transition rates Γ(|3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, m'⟩) are identical for all three possible values of m' (-1, 0, 1).\n        *   Since there are three equally probable final states for this decay step, the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them.\n        *   Therefore, the branching ratio for transitioning to any specific m' state is 1/3.\n            *   P(|3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, -1⟩) = 1/3\n            *   P(|3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 0⟩) = 1/3\n            *   P(|3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 1⟩) = 1/3\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 2: P(|2, 1, m'⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩)**\n        *   Now consider an atom in one of the intermediate states, |2, 1, m'⟩ (a 2p orbital).

The possible values are $n'=2$ or $n'=1$. However, for $n'=1$, only $l'=0$ is allowed. So, an intermediate state with $n'=1, l'=1$ does not exist.\n        *   Therefore, the only possible principal quantum number for the intermediate state is $n'=2$.\n        *   The intermediate states must belong to the $n=2, l=1$ subshell (the 2p subshell).\n        *   Applying the selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the possible values for $m'$ are $m' = m \\pm 1 = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle,$ and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check if transitions from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ are allowed.\n        *   Initial state: $l'=1$.

It can decay into three possible states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle,$ or $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n        *   The transition rate $\\Gamma$ is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator, $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n        *   For an unpolarized initial state (which $|l=0, m=0\\rangle$ intrinsically is, due to its spherical symmetry), the total decay rate to each of the magnetic sublevels of a given final ($n',l'$) will be equal. This is a consequence of the Wigner-Eckart theorem and the rotational symmetry of the system.\n        *   Let's denote the transition rates:\n            *   $\\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle)$\n            *   $\\Gamma_2 = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle)$\n            *   $\\Gamma_3 = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n        *   Due to symmetry, $\\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma_2 = \\Gamma_3$.\n        *   The total decay rate of the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is $\\Gamma_{tot} = \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_2 + \\Gamma_3 = 3\\Gamma_2$.\n        *   The probability (or branching ratio) of the decay proceeding via the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ channel is the ratio of the partial rate to the total rate:\n            $P_1 = \\frac{\\Gamma_2}{\\Gamma_{tot}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_2}{3\\Gamma_2} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n        *   So, the probability of the first step being $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Similarly, the probability of going to $|2,1,1\\rangle$ or $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is also $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** $P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n        *   Once the atom is in the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state, we must find its possible decay channels.\n        *   The selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ means the final state must have $l=0$ or $l=2$.\n        *   For decay, the final state must have lower energy, so $n$ must be less than 2.

The problem states this occurs via two successive \"dipole transitions\". This means we are looking for a cascade decay process: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. We need to identify a valid intermediate state and the probability of that specific decay path.\n\n2.  **Recall Dipole Selection Rules:** Electric dipole (E1) transitions are the most common type of radiative transitions and are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers $(n, l, m)$:\n    *   The orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$ must change by one: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number $m$ must change by 0 or 1: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   The principal quantum number $n$ is not restricted by a rule, but for a spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy, which means $n$ must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n3.  **Step 1: Find the Intermediate State:** Let's apply the selection rules to the first transition, from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **Initial State:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$**: Since the initial $l=0$, the intermediate state's orbital quantum number $l'$ must be $l' = 0 \\pm 1 = 1$. (It cannot be -1 as $l$ must be non-negative).\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$**: Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state's magnetic quantum number $m'$ can be $m' = 0 + (0, \\pm 1)$. Thus, $m'$ can be $0$, $+1$, or $-1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$**: The principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n4.  **Step 2: Check the Transition from the Intermediate State to the Final State:** Now, we check if a transition from our potential intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n    *   **Intermediate State candidates:** $|n'<3, l'=1, m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}\\rangle$.\n    *   **Final State:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   **Check $\\Delta l$**: The change in $l$ would be $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is a valid change according to the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   **Check $\\Delta n$**: The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' > n_f = 1$.\n    *   **Combine conditions for n'**: From Step 1 we have $n'<3$, and from Step 2 we have $n'>1$. The only integer value for $n'$ that satisfies both conditions is $n'=2$.\n\n5.  **Identify Possible Decay Routes:** Based on our analysis, the intermediate state must belong to the $n=2, l=1$ subshell (the 2p subshell). There are three such states, corresponding to the possible values of $m'$. This gives us three valid decay paths:\n    *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    All the routes proposed in the options A, B, C, and D are physically possible. The final determination rests on the probability.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):** The probability of a given route is the branching ratio of the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle$). The second transition, from any 2p state to the 1s state, has a probability of 1 since it's the only available dipole decay channel.\n    The key insight is that the initial state, $|3,0,0\\rangle$, is an s-state. S-states are spherically symmetric, meaning they have no preferred direction in space. The three possible intermediate states ($|2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$) are degenerate in energy and only differ by their orientation in space (as defined by the magnetic quantum number $m'$). Since the initial state is symmetric, there is no physical reason for it to prefer decaying into one orientation over another. Therefore, the probability of decaying into each of the three available intermediate states must be equal.\n\n    *   Total number of available, equally likely decay channels for the first step = 3.\n    *   Total probability must be 1.\n    *   Probability for any single channel = $\\frac{\\text{Total Probability}}{\\text{Number of Channels}} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

Identify the Transition Path**\n\nThe decay occurs in two steps, involving an intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. We apply the E1 selection rules for each step:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for decay (emission), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**Step 1: Decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   The selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ means the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   The principal quantum number must decrease, $n'<3$. A direct transition to $n'=1$ is not possible, as for $n'=1$, only $l'=0$ is allowed, which would violate $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. Thus, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n*   The selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ means that from $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Decay from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Let's check if the transition from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   Initial state: $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.

This is allowed if $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$, which is true for all our possible intermediate states.\n*   So, any of the paths $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ for $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$ are valid transition routes.

When such a state decays, the transition rates to each of the magnetic sublevels $m'$ of the final state (with a specific $l'$) are equal, assuming we average over all emission directions and polarizations. This is a consequence of the Wigner-Eckart theorem and rotational symmetry.\n*   Let $\\Gamma_{m'} = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$. Then $\\Gamma_0 = \\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma_{-1}$.\n*   The total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of the rates to all possible final states:\n    $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_{-1} = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n*   The branching ratio (probability) for the atom to follow the specific path to the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state is:\n    $P(\\text{Step 1 to } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   Similarly, the probability to transition to $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is 1/3, and to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is also 1/3.\n\n**Probability of Step 2: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Once the atom is in an excited state like $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it will decay to a lower energy state.\n*   The only state with energy lower than $n=2$ is the $n=1$ ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   As we established, the dipole transition $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   Since this is the only possible decay channel via an electric dipole transition from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the probability of this second step occurring is 1 (i.e., the branching ratio is 100%).\n\n**Total Probability of the Cascade**\nThe probability of the entire cascade is the product of the probabilities of each independent step. Let's evaluate the path given in option A:\n*   Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Probability = $P(\\text{Step 1 to } |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(\\text{Step 2 from } |2,1,0\\rangle)$\n*   Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Comparing with the Options**\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This matches our calculation exactly.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The path is valid, but our calculated probability is 1/3, not 1/4.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The path is valid, but our calculated probability is 1/3, not 1/4.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The path is correct, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only choice that provides both a correct transition route and the correct corresponding probability.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions follows specific quantum mechanical selection rules. A direct transition is forbidden because the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, ∆l, would be zero, which violates the rule that ∆l must be ±1 for a dipole transition. Therefore, the decay must occur through an intermediate state in a two-step process, often called a cascade.\n\n1.  **First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → Intermediate State**\n    *   The initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩ (a 3s orbital).\n    *   According to the selection rule ∆l = ±1, the orbital quantum number *l* must change from 0 to 1. This means the intermediate state must be a *p* orbital (l=1).\n    *   The selection rule for the magnetic quantum number *m* is ∆m = 0, ±1. Since the initial state has m=0, the intermediate state can have m' = -1, 0, or +1.\n    *   The options provided specify the intermediate state has a principal quantum number n=2. Thus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n2.  **Second Transition: Intermediate State → |1,0,0⟩**\n    *   The intermediate state has l=1. The final state |1,0,0⟩ has l=0. The change, ∆l = 0 - 1 = -1, is allowed by the selection rules.\n    *   For the magnetic quantum number, the final state has m=0. The transition from the intermediate m' to the final m=0 must satisfy ∆m = 0 - m' = 0, ±1. This condition is met for all possible intermediate states (m' = -1, 0, 1).\n\n**Transition Pathway and Probability**\n\nThe overall process is a cascade from the 3s state to the 1s state through one of the 2p states: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This corresponds to the branching ratio for the first step of the decay.\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of a photon. Consequently, the transitions to the three possible intermediate sublevels (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩) are equally likely. The total probability of transitioning from the |3,0,0⟩ state to any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states is the sum of the probabilities for each path. Since the three paths are equally probable, each must have a probability of 1/3 of the total 3s → 2p transition probability.\n\nSince the only allowed downward decay from the 3s state is to a 2p state, this branching ratio of 1/3 represents the probability of the entire cascade following that specific intermediate channel.\n\nTherefore, the probability for the transition route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is 1/3. The same probability of 1/3 applies to the routes via |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\nBased on the provided options:\n\n*   A) Incorrect probability.\n*   B) Incorrect probability and incomplete initial state notation.\n*   C) Incorrect probability.\n*   D) Correctly identifies a valid route and the corresponding probability.\n\nThe correct route and probability are:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the principles of quantum mechanics that govern the decay of an electron in a hydrogen atom, specifically the selection rules for electric dipole transitions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules\nThe electron is transitioning from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via a two-step process. The states are described in the standard $|n,l,m\\rangle$ notation, where:\n*   $n$ is the principal quantum number (energy level).\n*   $l$ is the azimuthal or orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n*   $m$ is the magnetic quantum number.\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n$, can be any integer. For decay, $\\Delta n$ must be negative.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Allowed Intermediate State(s)\nThe transition occurs in two steps, so there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n**First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' = 0, 1, \\text{or} -1$.\n    *   Since this is a decay cascade, the intermediate state must have a lower principal quantum number than the initial state, so $n' < 3$. The options provided suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$.\n\nThis leads to three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Final state:** $n=1, l=0, m=0$.\n*   We check if a transition from our possible intermediate states to the final state is allowed:\n    *   For any of the intermediate states ($|2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$), we have $l'=1$. The final state has $l=0$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed change.\n    *   The change in $m$ must also satisfy the rules. For each intermediate state:\n        *   $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$. (Allowed)\n        *   $|2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - 1 = -1$. (Allowed)\n        *   $|2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$. (Allowed)\n\nThus, all three paths are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Probability of Each Path\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the probability of the atom decaying into any of the three degenerate intermediate p-states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$) is equal.\n\nThe total probability of transitioning from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to any of the allowed $l=1$ states must be 1 (if we only consider these decay channels). Since there are three equally probable intermediate states, the probability of the atom taking any specific path is:\n\n$P(\\text{path}) = \\frac{1}{\\text{Number of equally probable paths}} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSo, the probabilities for the first step are:\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\nOnce the atom is in an intermediate state, it will proceed to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The question asks for the transition route and its corresponding probability. This refers to the probability of the specified sequence of events occurring. The branching ratio for each of the three possible decay routes is $1/3$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This route is allowed and the probability is correct.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nTo determine the correct transition route and corresponding probability for the decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two dipole transitions, we must apply the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n### 1. Understanding Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nIn the non-relativistic theory of the hydrogen atom, transitions between states are governed by selection rules. For an electric dipole transition, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, can be $0, \\pm 1$.\n*   There is no selection rule for the principal quantum number, $n$, but for spontaneous decay, the atom must transition to a state of lower energy ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Transition Cascade\n\nThe process involves a two-step decay from $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 1: Decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n*   **Applying Selection Rules:**\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$. The initial state is an *s*-orbital, so it must transition to a *p*-orbital.\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   $n' < 3$. For a two-step cascade to the $n=1$ state, the most probable intermediate state is one with $n=2$.\n*   **Intermediate States:** Based on the rules, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Decay from the intermediate state to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=1, l=0, m=0$).\n*   Let's check the validity of the transition from the possible intermediate states:\n    *   **From $|2,1,m'\\rangle$:**\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{intermediate} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m'$. For this to be allowed, $m'$ must be one of the values that makes $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. This condition holds for all three possibilities: $m'=0 (\\Delta m=0)$, $m'=1 (\\Delta m=-1)$, and $m'=-1 (\\Delta m=+1)$.\n*   Therefore, all three proposed cascades are physically possible:\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe question asks for the probability corresponding to a *specific* transition route. We need to find the branching ratio for the first step of the cascade.\n\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0, m=0$). In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   Because of this symmetry, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state. This can be formally shown using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, where the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ are found to be equal for $m'=-1, 0, 1$.\n*   Thus, the total probability of 1 is split equally among the three possible decay channels for the first step.\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n*   For the second step, the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level) have only one allowed electric dipole decay channel, which is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s ground state). The transition to the 2s state ($|2,0,0\\rangle$) is forbidden by the parity selection rule ($\\Delta l = -1$ is required, but s to p is allowed, however, p to s is parity changing). Therefore, the probability of the transition from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is 1 (or 100%).\n\n*   The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route specified in options A and D:\n    $P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    $P_{total} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct transition route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and the probability of this specific path occurring is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches option D.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
